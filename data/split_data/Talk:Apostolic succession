Trouble archiving links on the articleHello.  I am finding myself repeatedly archiving links on this page.  This usually happens when the archive doesn't recognize the archive to be good.This could be because the link is either a redirect, or I am unknowingly archiving a dead link.  Please check the following links to see if it's redirecting, or in anyway bad, and fix them, if possible.* * * * * * In any event this will be the only notification in regards to these links, and I will discontinue my attempts to archive these pages.Cheers.—User:Cyberbot II|cyberbot IIUser talk:Cyberbot II|Talk to my owner:Online;20:22, 13 July 2015 (UTC)External links modifiedHello fellow Wikipedians,I have just added archive links to 4 external links on Apostolic succession. Please take a moment to review . If necessary, add cbignore after the link to keep me from modifying it. Alternatively, you can add  to keep me off the page altogether.
