When the article makes comments such as "75% of the adult population could vote", what does it mean by "adult"? Judging by the comment for 1928, it seems that "adult" means a person aged 21 or over. In any case, it needs to be explained in the article, otherwise it's not very meaningful. --Zundark, 2001 Nov 30-----The list of PMs needs some consistency. The name being used for each is very inconsistent between using titles and using given names, which is making a situation that's already confusing at times even more confusing. For example...."Bentinck" -- William Bentinck -- was actually Duke of Portland. The list usually goes by title, as is being done with Earl Grey. Disraeli was "Earl Beaconsfield" for some of his time in power.Additionally, the Duke of Melbourne is listed as "Lamb", which again was his birth name and not his title.I'd like to suggest that the compiler of this list go through his naming conventions again, and apply them. Pick titles, pick names, whatever, but don't mix it up like this. -- Paul DryeI have no naming conventions. And as this is wikipedia I place all the onus on you to correct the list as it is clear that you know about this - 62.253.64.xxx:In that case then, I'll correct it by replacing it with a link to the already-existing list at Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Simpler all around. -- Paul DryeArghh... just moved this only to find that there's a bit of a profusion on this topic. I'm going to try to merge them and sort it out, and redirect as appropriate.
