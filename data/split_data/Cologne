'''Cologne''' (; German '''''Köln''''' ,  ), is the largest city both in the federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany and is the fourth-largest city in the country (after Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich). It is located within the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region, one of the major European metropolitan regions and the largest in Germany with more than ten million inhabitants.Cologne is located on both sides of the Rhine River, less than eighty kilometres from Belgium. The city's famous Cologne Cathedral (''Kölner Dom'') is the seat of the Catholic Archbishop of Cologne. The University of Cologne (''Universität zu Köln'') is one of Europe's oldest and largest universities.Cologne was founded and established in Ubii territory in the first century AD as the Roman ''Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium'', from which it gets its name. "Cologne", the French version of the city's name, has become standard in English as well. The city functioned as the capital of the Roman province of ''Germania Inferior'' and as the headquarters of the Roman military in the region until occupied by the Franks in 462. During the Middle Ages it flourished on one of the most important major trade routes between east and west in Europe. Cologne was one of the leading members of the Hanseatic League and one of the largest cities north of the Alps in medieval and Renaissance times. Up until World War II the city had undergone several occupations by the French and also by the British (1918-1926). Cologne was one of the most heavily-bombed cities in Germany during World War II, the Royal Air Force (RAF) dropping 34,711 long tons of bombs on the city. The bombing reduced the population by 95%, mainly due to evacuation, and destroyed almost the entire city. With the intention of restoring as many historic buildings as possible, the successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape.Cologne is a major cultural centre for the Rhineland; it hosts more than thirty museums and hundreds of galleries. Exhibitions range from local ancient Roman archeological sites to contemporary graphics and sculpture. The Cologne Trade Fair hosts a number of trade shows such as Art Cologne, imm Cologne, Gamescom, and the Photokina.HistoryTimeline of CologneRoman CologneThe first urban settlement on the grounds of modern-day Cologne was ''Oppidum Ubiorum'', founded in 38BC by the Ubii, a Cisrhenian Germanic tribe. In 50AD, the Romans founded Colonia on the Rhine"Cologne History"and the city became the provincial capital of Germania Inferior in 85AD. The city was named "''Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium''" in 50AD."Facts and figures"Considerable Roman remains can be found in present-day Cologne, especially near the wharf area, where a notable discovery of a 1900-year-old Roman boat was made in late 2007. From 260 to 271 Cologne was the capital of the Gallic Empire under Postumus, Marius, and Victorinus. In 310 under Constantine a bridge was built over the Rhine at Cologne. Roman imperial governors resided in the city and it became one of the most important trade and production centres in the Roman Empire north of the Alps."Cologne History"Maternus, who was elected as bishop in 313, was the first known bishop of Cologne. The city was the capital of a Roman province until occupied by the Ripuarian Franks in 462. Parts of the original Roman sewers are preserved underneath the city, with the new sewerage system having opened in 1890.Middle AgesEarly medieval Cologne was part of Austrasia within the Frankish Empire.Cologne had been the seat of a bishop since the Roman period; under Charlemagne, in 795, bishop Hildebold was promoted to archbishop."Cologne History"In 843 Cologne became a city within the Treaty of Verdun-created East Francia.In 953, the archbishops of Cologne first gained noteworthy secular power, when bishop Bruno was appointed as duke by his brother Otto I, King of Germany. In order to weaken the secular nobility, who threatened his power, Otto endowed Bruno and his successors on the bishop's see with the prerogatives of secular princes, thus establishing the Electorate of Cologne, formed by the temporal possessions of the archbishopric and included in the end a strip of territory along the left Bank of the Rhine east of Jülich, as well as the Duchy of Westphalia on the other side of the Rhine, beyond Berg and Mark.By the end of the 12th century, the Archbishop of Cologne was one of the seven electors of the Holy Roman Emperor. Besides being prince elector, he was Arch-chancellor of Italy as well, technically from 1238 and permanently from 1263 until 1803.Following the Battle of Worringen in 1288, Cologne gained its independence from the archbishops and became a Free City. Archbishop Sigfried II von Westerburg was forced into exile in Bonn.Harry de Quetteville. "[History of Cologne]". ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 28 November 2009.The archbishop nevertheless preserved the right of capital punishment. Thus the municipal council (though in strict political opposition towards the archbishop) depended upon him in all matters concerning criminal justice. This included torture, which sentence was only allowed to be handed down by the episcopal judge, the so-called "Greve". This legal situation lasted until the French conquest of Cologne.Besides its economic and political significance Cologne also became an important centre of medieval pilgrimage, when Cologne's Archbishop Rainald of Dassel gave the relics of the Three Wise Men to Cologne's cathedral in 1164 (after they in fact had been captured from Milan). Besides the three magi Cologne preserves the relics of Saint Ursula and Albertus Magnus.Cologne's location on the river Rhine placed it at the intersection of the major trade routes between east and west and was the basis of Cologne's growth. By 1300 the city population were 50,000-55,000. Cologne was a member of the Hanseatic League in 1475, when Frederick III confirmed the city's imperial immediacy."Cologne History"Cologne around 1411Early modern historyThe economic structures of medieval and early modern Cologne were characterised by the city's status as a major harbour and transport hub on the Rhine. Craftsmanship was organised by self-administering guilds, some of which were exclusive to women.As a free city, Cologne was a sovereign state within the Holy Roman Empire and as such had the right (and obligation) to maintain its own military force. As they wore a red uniform, these troops were known as the ''Rote Funken'' (red sparks). These soldiers were part of the Army of the Holy Roman Empire ("Reichskontingent") and fought in the wars of the 17th and 18th century, including the wars against revolutionary France, when the small force was almost completely wiped out in combat. The tradition of these troops is preserved as a military persiflage by Cologne's most outstanding carnival society, the ''Rote Funken''.The free city of Cologne must not be confused with the Archbishopric of Cologne which was a state of its own within the Holy Roman Empire. Since the second half of the 16th century the archbishops were drawn from the Bavaria Wittelsbach dynasty. Due to the free status of Cologne, the archbishops were usually not allowed to enter the city. Thus they took up residence in Bonn and later in Brühl, North Rhine-Westphalia|Brühl on the Rhine. As members of an influential and powerful family, and supported by their outstanding status as electors, the archbishops of Cologne repeatedly challenged and threatened the free status of Cologne during the 17th and 18th centuries, resulting in complicated affairs, which were handled by diplomatic means and propaganda as well as by the supreme courts of the Holy Roman Empire.From the 19th century until World War IIFile:Hängebrücke - Köln (1).tif|thumb|HängebrückeCologne lost its status as a free city during the French period. According to the Peace Treaty of Lunéville (1801) all the territories of the Holy Roman Empire on the left bank of the Rhine were officially incorporated into the French Republic (which had already occupied Cologne in 1794). Thus this region later became part of Napoleon's Empire. Cologne was part of the French Department (administrative division)|Département Roer (named after the River Roer, German: Rur) with Aachen (French: Aix-la-Chapelle) as its capital. The French modernised public life, for example by introducing the Napoleonic code and removing the old elites from power. The Napoleonic code remained in use on the left bank of the Rhine until 1900, when a unified civil code (the ''Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch'') was introduced in the German Empire. In 1815 at the Congress of Vienna, Cologne was made part of the Kingdom of Prussia, first in the Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|Jülich-Cleves-Berg province and then the Rhine province.The permanent tensions between the Roman Catholic Rhineland and the overwhelmingly Protestant Prussian state repeatedly escalated with Cologne being in the focus of the conflict. In 1837 the archbishop of Cologne, Clemens August von Droste-Vischering, was arrested and imprisoned for two years after a dispute over the legal status of marriages between Protestants and Roman Catholics (''Mischehenstreit''). In 1874, during the Kulturkampf, Archbishop Paul Melchers was imprisoned before taking refuge in the Netherlands. These conflicts alienated the Catholic population from Berlin and contributed to a deeply felt anti-Prussian resentment, which was still significant after World War II, when the former mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer, became the first West German chancellor.During the 19th and 20th centuries, Cologne absorbed numerous surrounding towns, and by World WarI had already grown to 700,000 inhabitants. Industrialisation changed the city and spurred its growth. Vehicle and engine manufacturing were especially successful, though heavy industry was less ubiquitous than in the Ruhr area. The cathedral, started in 1248 but abandoned around 1560, was eventually finished in 1880 not just as a place of worship but also as a German national monument celebrating the newly founded German empire and the continuity of the German nation since the Middle Ages. Some of this urban growth occurred at the expense of the city's historic heritage with much being demolished (for example, the city walls or the area around the cathedral) and sometimes replaced by contemporary buildings.Cologne was designated as one of the Fortresses of the German Confederation., December 1835 It was turned into a heavily armed fortress (opposing the French and Belgian fortresses of Verdun and Liège (city)|Liège) with two fortified belts surrounding the city, the remains of which can be seen to this day. The military demands on what became Germany's largest fortress presented a significant obstacle to urban development, with forts, bunkers, and wide defensive dugouts completely encircling the city and preventing expansion; this resulted in a very densely built-up area within the city itself.During World WarI Cologne was the target of several minor air raids, but suffered no significant damage. Cologne was occupied by the British Army of the Rhine until 1926, under the terms of the Armistice and the subsequent Versailles Peace Treaty., ''TIME Magazine'', 15 February 1926In contrast with the harsh behaviour of the French occupation troops in Germany, the British forces were more lenient to the local population. Konrad Adenauer, the mayor of Cologne from 1917 until 1933 and later a West German chancellor, acknowledged the political impact of this approach, especially since Britain had opposed French demands for a permanent Allied occupation of the entire Rhineland.As part of the demilitarisation of the Rhineland, the city's fortifications had to be dismantled. This was an opportunity to create two green belts (''Grüngürtel'') around the city by converting the fortifications and their fields of fire into large public parks. This was not completed until 1933. In 1919 the University of Cologne, closed by the French in 1798, was reopened. This was considered to be a replacement for the loss of the University of Strasbourg on the west bank of the Rhine, which reverted to France with the rest of Alsace. Cologne prospered during the Weimar Republic (1919–33), and progress was made especially in public governance, city planning, housing and social affairs. Social housing projects were considered exemplary and were copied by other German cities. Cologne competed to host the Olympics, and a modern sports stadium was erected at Müngersdorf. When the British occupation ended, the prohibition of civil aviation was lifted and Cologne Butzweilerhof Airport soon became a hub for national and international air traffic, second in Germany only to Berlin Tempelhof Airport.The democratic parties lost the local elections in Cologne in March 1933 to the Nazi Party and other right wing parties. The Nazis then arrested the Communist and Social Democrats members of the city assembly, and Mayor Adenauer was dismissed. Compared to some other major cities, however, the Nazis never gained decisive support in Cologne. (Significantly, the number of votes cast for the Nazi Party in Reichstag elections had always been the national average.) By 1939 the population had risen to 772,221 inhabitants.World War IIThe devastation of Cologne, 1945During World War II, Cologne was a Military Area Command Headquarters (''Militärbereichshauptkommandoquartier'') for the Military District (''Wehrkreis'') VI of Münster. Cologne was under the command of Lieutenant-General Freiherr Roeder von Diersburg, who was responsible for military operations in Bonn, Siegburg, Aachen, Jülich, Düren, and Monschau. Cologne was home to the 211th Infantry Regiment and the 26th Artillery Regiment.During the Bombing of Cologne in World War II, Cologne endured 262 air raids by the Western Allies, which caused approximately 20,000 civilian casualties and almost completely wiped out the central part of the city. During the night of 31 May 1942, Cologne was the target of "Operation Millennium", the first 1,000 bomber raid by the Royal Air Force in World WarII. 1,046 heavy bombers attacked their target with 1,455 tons of explosives, approximately two-thirds of which were incendiary.Tourtellot, Arthur B. et al. ''Life's Picture History of World WarII'', p. 237. Time, Inc., New York, 1950. This raid lasted about 75 minutes, destroyed 0 of built-up area, killed 486 civilians and made 59,000 people homeless. By the end of the war, the population of Cologne had been reduced by 95 per cent. This loss was mainly caused by a massive evacuation of the people to more rural areas. The same happened in many other German cities in the last two years of war. By the end of 1945, however, the population had already recovered to approximately 500,000.By the end of the war, essentially all of Cologne's pre-war Jewish population of 11,000 had been deported or killed by the Nazis.Kirsten Serup-Bilfeld, Zwischen Dom und Davidstern. Jüdisches Leben in Köln von den Anfängen bis heute. Köln 2001, page 193 The six synagogues of the city were destroyed. The Roonstrasse Synagogue|synagogue on Roonstraße was rebuilt in 1959.Post-war Cologne until todayCologne, seen from the International Space StationDespite Cologne's status as the largest city in the region, nearby Düsseldorf was chosen as the political capital of the federated state of North Rhine-Westphalia. With Bonn being chosen as the provisional federal capital (''provisorische Bundeshauptstadt'') and seat of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany (then informally West Germany), Cologne benefited by being sandwiched between two important political centres. The city became - and still is - home to a number of federal agencies and organizations. After reunification in 1990, Berlin was made the capital of Germany.In 1945 architect and urban planner Rudolf Schwarz called Cologne the "world's greatest heap of rubble". Schwarz designed the master plan for reconstruction in 1947, which included the construction of several new thoroughfares through the city centre, especially the ''Nord-Süd-Fahrt'' ("North-South-Drive"). The master plan took into consideration the fact that even shortly after the war a large increase in automobile traffic could be anticipated. Plans for new roads had already, to a certain degree, evolved under the Nazi administration, but the actual construction became easier when most of the city centre was in ruins.The destruction of 95% of the city centre, including the famous Twelve Romanesque churches such as St. Gereon's Basilica|St.Gereon, Great St. Martin Church|Great St.Martin, St.Maria im Kapitol and several other monuments in World WarII, meant a tremendous loss of cultural treasures. The rebuilding of those churches and other landmarks such as the Gürzenich event hall was not undisputed among leading architects and art historians at that time, but in most cases, civil intention prevailed. The reconstruction lasted until the 1990s, when the Romanesque church of St. Kunibert (Cologne)|St.Kunibert was finished.In 1959, the city's population reached pre-war numbers again. It then grew steadily, exceeding 1million for about one year from 1975. It remained just below that until mid-2010, when it exceeded 1million again.File:2013-08-10 07-18-55 Ballonfahrt über Köln EH 0626.jpg|thumb|left|Cologne in 2013Post-reunificationIn the 1980s and 1990s Cologne's economy prospered for two main reasons. The first was the growth in the number of media companies, both in the private and public sectors; they are especially catered for in the newly developed Media Park, which creates a strongly visual focal point in Cologne city centre and includes the ''KölnTurm'', one of Cologne's most prominent high-rise buildings. The second was the permanent improvement of the diverse traffic infrastructure, which made Cologne one of the most easily accessible metropolitan areas in Central Europe.Due to the economic success of the Cologne Trade Fair, the city arranged a large extension to the fair site in 2005. At the same time the original buildings, which date back to the 1920s, were rented out to RTL, Germany's largest private broadcaster, as their new corporate headquarters.GeographyThe metropolitan area encompasses over , extending around a central point that lies at 50° 56' 33 latitude and 6° 57' 32 longitude. The city's highest point is  above sea level (the Monte Troodelöh) and its lowest point is  above sea level (the Worringer Bruch).Bezirksregierung Köln: Topografische Karte 1:50.000 (TK 50), Blatt L 5108 Köln-Mülheim.

The city of Cologne lies within the larger area of the Cologne Lowland, a cone-shaped area of southeastern Westphalia that lies between Bonn, Aachen and Düsseldorf.DistrictsDistricts of CologneCologne is subdivided into 9 boroughs (''Stadtbezirke'') and 85 districts (''Stadtteile''):{| class="toccolours" style="margin:0 auto; backgrond:none;"| style="padding-right:1em;" |; Innenstadt (Stadtbezirk 1): Altstadt-Nord, Altstadt-Süd, Neustadt-Nord, Neustadt-Süd, Deutz; Rodenkirchen (Stadtbezirk 2): Bayenthal, Godorf, Hahnwald, Immendorf, Marienburg, Meschenich, Raderberg, Raderthal, Rodenkirchen, Rondorf, Sürth, Weiß, Zollstock; Lindenthal (Stadtbezirk 3):  Braunsfeld, Junkersdorf, Klettenberg, Lindenthal, Lövenich, Müngersdorf, Sülz, Weiden, Widdersdorf; Ehrenfeld (Stadtbezirk 4): Bickendorf, Bocklemünd/Mengenich, Ehrenfeld, Neuehrenfeld, Ossendorf, Vogelsang; Nippes (Stadtbezirk 5): Bilderstöckchen, Longerich, Mauenheim, Niehl, Nippes, Riehl, Weidenpesch| 300px|; Chorweiler (Stadtbezirk 6): Blumenberg, Chorweiler, Esch/Auweiler, Fühlingen, Heimersdorf, Lindweiler, Merkenich, Pesch, Roggendorf/Thenhoven, Seeberg, Volkhoven/Weiler, Worringen; Porz (Stadtbezirk 7): Eil, Elsdorf, Ensen, Finkenberg, Gremberghoven, Grengel, Langel, Libur, Lind, Poll, Porz, Urbach, Wahn, Wahnheide, Westhoven, Zündorf; Kalk (Stadtbezirk 8): Brück, Höhenberg, Humboldt/Gremberg, Kalk, Merheim, Neubrück, Ostheim, Rath/Heumar, Vingst; Mülheim, Cologne|Mülheim (Stadtbezirk 9): Buchforst, Buchheim, Dellbrück, Dünnwald, Flittard, Höhenhaus, Holweide, Mülheim, Stammheim|}ClimateCologne is one of the warmest cities in Germany. It has a temperate–oceanic climate with relatively mild winters and warm summers. It is also one of the cloudiest cities in Germany, with just 1427 hours of sun a year. Its average annual temperature is :  during the day and  at night. In January, the mean temperature is , while the mean temperature in July is . Precipitation is spread evenly throughout the year.Flood protectionFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-10776, Köln, Hochwasser.jpg|right|thumb|The 1930 flood in CologneCologne is regularly affected by flooding from the Rhine and is considered the most flood-prone European city. A city agency (''Stadtentwässerungsbetriebe Köln'', "Cologne Urban Drainage Operations") manages an extensive flood control system which includes both permanent and mobile flood walls, protection from rising waters for buildings close to the river banks, monitoring and forecasting systems, pumping stations and programmes to create or protect floodplains, and river embankments.MITCHThe system was redesigned after a 1993 flood, which resulted in heavy damage.MITCHDemographicsDemographics of CologneIn the Roman Empire the city was large and rich with a population of 40,000 in 100–200AD. The city was home to around 20,000 people in 1000AD, growing to 50,000 in 1200AD. The Rhineland metropolis still had 50,000 residents in 1300AD.Cologne is the fourth-largest city in Germany in terms of inhabitants after Berlin, Hamburg and Munich. As of 30 June 2011, there were officially 1,010,269 residents. Cologne is the core city of the Cologne/Bonn Region with around 3million inhabitants (including the neighbouring cities of Bonn, Hürth, Leverkusen, and Bergisch Gladbach).According to local statistics, in 2006 the population density in the city was 2,528 inhabitants per square kilometre. 31.4 per cent of the population had migrated there, and 17.2 per cent of Cologne's population was non-German. The largest group, comprising 6.3 per cent of the total population, was Turkish. As of September 2007, there were about 120,000 Muslims living in Cologne, mostly of Turkish origin. Cologne also has one of the oldest and largest Jewish communities in Germany.In the city the age of the population ranged between 15.5% under the age of 18, 67.0% from 18 to 64, and 17.4% who were 65 years of age or older.{| class="infobox" style="float:right;"| style="text-align:center;" colspan="2" | '''Significant foreign born populations'''|-!

Various interest groups often form networks beyond party boundaries. The resulting web of relationships, with political, economic, and cultural links with each other in a system of mutual favours, obligations and dependencies, is called the 'Cologne coterie'. This has often led to an unusual proportional distribution in the city government and degenerated at times into corruption: in 1999, a "waste scandal" over kickbacks and illegal campaign contributions came to light, which led not only to the imprisonment of the entrepreneur Hellmut Trienekens, but also to the downfall of almost the entire leadership of the ruling Social Democrats.MayorThe Lord Mayor of Cologne is Henriette Reker. She received 52.66% of the vote at the municipal election on 17 October 2015 and was appointed on 15 December 2015.ElectionsCity Councillors are elected for a five-year term and the Mayor has a six-year term.Make-up of city council{| class="wikitable"|-!Party!!Seats!!Source|-|Social Democratic Party||27||rowspan="10"||-|Christian Democratic Union||24|-|Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party||18|-|The Left||6|-|Free Democratic Party||5|-|Alternative for Germany||3|-|Pirate Party Germany||2|-|pro Cologne||2|-|Your Friends||2|-|Free Voters||1|}CityscapeThe inner city of Cologne was completely destroyed during World WarII. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. Thus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the "Wiederaufbauzeit" (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house by Wilhelm Riphahn, are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture. Nevertheless, the uncompromising style of the Cologne Opera house and other modern buildings has remained controversial.Green areas account for over a quarter of Cologne, which is approximately  of public green space for every inhabitant.WildlifeThe presence of animals in Cologne is generally limited to insects, small rodents, and several species of birds. Pigeons are the most often seen animals in Cologne, although the number of birds is augmented each year by a growing population of feral exotics, most visibly parrots such as the rose-ringed parakeet. The sheltered climate in southeast Westphalia allows these birds to survive through the winter, and in some cases they are displacing native species. The plumage of Cologne's green parrots is highly visible even from a distance, and contrasts starkly with the otherwise muted colours of the cityscape.TourismCologne had 4.31million overnight stays booked and 2.38million arrivals in 2008."Cologneglance"The city also has the most pubs per capita in Germany. The city has 70 clubs, "countless" bars, restaurants, and pubs."Nightlife"LandmarksChurches* Cologne Cathedral (German: ''Kölner Dom'') is the city's most famous monument and the Cologne residents' most loved landmark. It is a Gothic church, started in 1248, and completed in 1880. In 1996, it was designated a World Heritage site; it houses the Shrine of the Three Kings, which supposedly contains the relics of the Three Magi (see also). Residents of Cologne sometimes refer to the cathedral as "the eternal construction site" (''die ewige Baustelle'').* Twelve Romanesque churches: These buildings are outstanding examples of medieval church architecture. The origins of some of the churches go back as far as Roman times, for example St.Gereon, which was originally a chapel in a Roman graveyard. With the exception of St. Maria Lyskirchen all of these churches were very badly damaged during World WarII. Reconstruction was only finished in the 1990s.File:Kdom.jpg|Cologne CathedralFile:Köln - Groß St. Martin vom Dom.jpg|Great St. Martin ChurchFile:Severeinskirche aus Severinstorburg 2009.jpg|Basilica of St. SeverinFile:Koeln mariae himmelfahrt 001.jpg|Church of the AssumptionFile:Trinitatiskirche Koeln2007.jpg|Holy Trinity ChurchMedieval housesThe Cologne City Hall (''Kölner Rathaus''), founded in the 12th century, is the oldest city hall in Germany still in use.

Other orchestras are the Musica Antiqua Köln and the WDR Rundfunkorchester Köln, as well as the Cologne Opera and several choirs, including the WDR Rundfunkchor Köln. Cologne was also an important hotbed for electronic music in the 1950s (Studio für elektronische Musik, Karlheinz Stockhausen) and again from the 1990s onward. The public radio and TV station WDR was involved in promoting musical movements such as Krautrock in the 1970s; the influential Can was formed there in 1968. There are several centres of nightlife, among them the ''Kwartier Latäng'' (the student quarter around the Zülpicher Straße) and the nightclub-studded areas around Hohenzollernring, Friesenplatz and Rudolfplatz.The large annual literary festival Lit. Cologne features regional and international authors. The main literary figure connected with Cologne is writer Heinrich Böll, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature.Cologne is well known for its beer, called Kölsch (beer)|Kölsch. Colognian language|Kölsch is also the name of the local dialect. This has led to the common joke of Kölsch being the only language one can drink.Cologne is also famous for Eau de Cologne (German: ''Kölnisch Wasser''; lit: "Water of Cologne"), a perfume created by Italian expatriate Johann Maria Farina at the beginning of the 18th century. During the 18th century this perfume became increasingly popular, was exported all over Europe by the Farina family and ''Farina'' became a household name for ''Eau de Cologne''. In 1803 Wilhelm Mülhens entered into a contract with an unrelated person from Italy named Carlo Francesco Farina who granted him the right to use his family name and Mühlens opened a small factory at Cologne's Glockengasse. In later years, and after various court battles, his grandson Ferdinand Mülhens was forced to abandon the name ''Farina'' for the company and their product. He decided to use the house number given to the factory at Glockengasse during the French occupation in the early 19th century, 4711. Today, original Eau de Cologne is still produced in Cologne by both the Johann Maria Farina gegenüber dem Jülichs-Platz|Farina family, currently in the eighth generation, and by Mäurer ; Wirtz who bought the 4711 brand in 2006.CarnivalThe Cologne carnival is one of the largest street festivals in Europe. In Cologne, the carnival season officially starts on 11 November at 11 minutes past 11a.m. with the proclamation of the new Carnival Season, and continues until Ash Wednesday. However, the so-called "Tolle Tage" (crazy days) do not start until ''Weiberfastnacht'' (Women's Carnival) or, in dialect, ''Wieverfastelovend'', the Thursday before Ash Wednesday, which is the beginning of the street carnival. Zülpicher Strasse and its surroundings, Neumarkt square, Heumarkt and all bars and pubs in the city are crowded with people in costumes dancing and drinking in the streets. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to Cologne during this time. Generally, around a million people celebrate in the streets on the Thursday before Ash Wednesday.Rivalry with DüsseldorfCologne and Düsseldorf have a "fierce regional rivalry", which includes carnival parades, football, and beer."Rivalry"People in Cologne prefer Kölsch (beer)|Kölsch while people in Düsseldorf prefer Altbier ("Alt")."Rivalry"Waiters and patrons will "scorn" and make a "mockery" of people who order Alt beer in Cologne and Kölsch in Düsseldorf."Rivalry"The rivalry has been described as a "love–hate relationship"."Rivalry"MuseumsFile:Museum Ludwig Köln - Südeingang - Schriftzug.jpg|thumb|The Museum Ludwig houses one of the most important collections of modern art.File:Dionysusmozaïek 17-02-2009 10-51-23.JPG|thumb|Roman excavation in Cologne: Dionysus Mosaic on display at Römisch-Germanisches MuseumList of museums in Cologne* Farina Fragrance Museum – birthplace of Eau de Cologne* Römisch-Germanisches Museum (Roman-Germanic Museum) – ancient Roman and Germanic culture* Wallraf-Richartz Museum – European painting from the 13th to the early 20th century* Museum Ludwig – modern art* Museum Schnütgen – medieval art* Museum für Angewandte Kunst (Cologne)|Museum für Angewandte Kunst – applied art* Kolumba|Kolumba Kunstmuseum des Erzbistums Köln (art museum of the Archbishopric of Cologne) – modern art museum built around medieval ruins, completed 2007* Cathedral Treasury "Domschatzkammer" – historic underground vaults of the Cathedral* EL-DE Haus, – former local headquarters of the Gestapo houses a museum documenting Nazi rule in Cologne with a special focus on the persecution of political dissenters and minorities* German Sports and Olympic Museum – exhibitions about sports from antiquity until the present* Imhoff-Schokoladenmuseum – Chocolate Museum* Geomuseum of the University of Cologne - the exhibition includes fossils (such as dinosaur bones and the skeleton of an Eryops), stones and minerals* Forum for Internet Technology in Contemporary Art – collections of Internet-based art, corporate part of (NewMediaArtProjectNetwork):cologne, the experimental platform for art and New Media* Flora und Botanischer Garten Köln, the city's formal park and main botanical garden* Forstbotanischer Garten Köln, an arboretum and woodland botanical gardenMusic fairs and festivalsThe city was home to the internationally famous Ringfest, and now to the C/o pop festival."C/o pop";In addition, Cologne enjoys a thriving Christmas Market Weihnachtsmarkt presence with several locations in the city.EconomyFile:Koelnmesse Nordeingang.jpg|thumb|North entrance to Koelnmesse, 2008File:Rheinauhafen - The Bench - Rheinseite (1828-30).jpg|thumb|Modern office building at RheinauhafenAs the largest city in the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region, Cologne benefits from a large market structure.

The first German limited access road was constructed after 1929 between Cologne and Bonn. Today, this is the Bundesautobahn 555. In 1965, Cologne became the first German city to be fully encircled by a motorway ringroad. Roughly at the same time a city centre bypass (''Stadtautobahn'') was planned, but only partially put into effect, due to opposition by environmental groups. The completed section became ''Bundesstraße ("Federal Road") B 55a'' which begins at the ''Zoobrücke'' ("Zoo Bridge") and meets with Bundesautobahn 4|A4 and Bundesautobahn 3|A3 at the interchange Cologne East. Nevertheless, it is referred to as ''Stadtautobahn'' by most locals. In contrast to this the ''Nord-Süd-Fahrt'' ("North-South-Drive") was actually completed, a new four/six-lane city centre through-route, which had already been anticipated by planners such as Fritz Schumacher in the 1920s. The last section south of ''Ebertplatz'' was completed in 1972.In 2005, the first stretch of an eight-lane motorway in North Rhine-Westphalia was opened to traffic on Bundesautobahn3, part of the eastern section of the Cologne Beltway between the interchanges Cologne East and Heumar.Cyclingright|Cologne Stadtbahn at Bensberg stationFile:146 019-5 Rheinexpressinkoelnhbf.jpg|thumb|right|Train at Köln HauptbahnhofCompared to other German cities, Cologne has a traffic layout that is not very bicycle-friendly.
