Founding date is wrongIt jars me that the founding year currently in the infobox -  1932 - is actually the founding year of Auto Union, not Audi in its present form.  This is where it gets a bit ambiguous.Strictly speaking, Audi has two founding years - the original August Horch enterprise in 1910, and the modern era company in 1969 when Auto Union and NSU were merged.  Suggest we put both in the infobox with a title and a break in between them.  Don't want to barge in and change it without sounding out other ppl's opinions first.

The German government (or someone) wanted a really cheap and easy car to build for the people to use because they realized the populating masses need to get around.  The Porsche designer came up with the Beetle concept and released it under the car brand "Volkswagen" ("people's car").  This influence can be felt in some VW cars have the same type of air-(or is it water?) cooled system Porsche's used too.  Audi kept chugging along, acquiring another company in the 1970's (I think NSW), while their Volkswagen unit exploded with Beetle popularity since the Beetle came out.  The company then changed their name to VAG (Volkswagen-Audi Group) (others think it stands for Volkswagen AG, where AG is the abbreviation for the German word "Aktiengesellschaft" which is english for Stock Company) to reflect that VW was more of an equal partner because without their capital, Audi might not have survived into the 80's.  Audi as a car brand started becoming popular through rally racing.  Their advertising unit used the "if it's good enough to drive 80 mph through dark forest paths in the snow, it can handle anything you've got to drive it through" notion, and sharing the lead with Subaru in the four-wheel drive craze of the mid-80's.  This goes off-topic I know, but more trivia for the readers.  Subaru and Audi used four-wheel drive as a big selling point, whereas Porsche and Mercedes had it available but their four-wheel drive systems weren't as reliable with Mercedes being the worst of the group, I hear it wasn't true four-wheel drive, that it was a hybrid between four-wheel drive and rear-wheel drive.  Audi took the luxury four-wheel drive road, Subaru took the economical four-wheel drive road. and all others practically pulled out but a few manufacturers still dabble or offer four-wheel drive systems on a very limited basis.  --LighthouseJ 17:37, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC):I don't believe that this is historically accurate.  Please see Ferdinand Porsche for a backgrounder on the Beetle. Jbetak 05:47, 28 January 2006 (UTC)Vorsprung?Your translation of ''Vorsprung durch Technik'' is not correct: "progress" translates "Fortschritt" in German.  I'm afraid that I can't offer you a better translation, my English just isn't good enough.  I would suggest "leadership", that's a little bit closer, but still not exactly the same as Vorsprung.  Let me put it like this:''After on e wekk Lance Armstrong was only 20 seconds ahead, but in the Pyrenees his VORSPRUNG rose to more than two minutes''Who can help?--62.199.240.86 01:56, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)(from de:wikipedia):To further help out the translation, I found an advertisement on the net for Audi.  It poses the question "vorsprung" and then "what is it?".  It then says "there are those who have it..." and shows Muhammed Ali fighting, Albert Einstein thinking and Marilyn Monroe with her famous dress, Dr. Martin Luther King at his I Have A Dream... speech, Mahatma Ghandi looks around a room and other imagery.  The second part says "and those who don't" and it shows lazy guys sleeping, sipping coffee, falling asleep in a recliner and waiting for a haircut.  The sequence ends with "and never will".  The third part begins with "But you'll always know it, when you see it". and shows some older and powerful Audi racing films from earlier in the 20th centure and the 21st century Le Mans competitions and includes some clips from the 80's (my personal favorite time in Audi racing) of the Audi quattro kicking dirt up around turns and people desperately trying to get out of the way.  Before the end, there's a radio-quality clip of what sounds like Dr. August Horch laid over film of him actually speaking that says "You've got to have the vorsprung in order to be in front."  The rest of ad shows mostly racing clips intermixed with examples of vorsprung.  If you are interested in watching it, I suggest you download a copy at :Vorsprung means the passion to accel ahead of the rest, to be the best.--LighthouseJ 06:32, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)::I guess "vorsprung" could be loosely translated as "edge" or "competitive edge" in the context mentioned above.  Advantage is a more conservative translation and advancement is closest to "fortschritt", which is not what we are looking for IMHO.  My best guess: "Edge Through Technology" Jbetak 06:55, 25 July 2005 (UTC):::Apparently, Audi used "Advantage through Technology" in a [1986 UK advertising campaign].  Leave it as it is then? Jbetak 07:05, 25 July 2005 (UTC)::::"Vorsprung" (in this context) translates as "head start" or "lead" - so a good (non-literal) translation would be "Our technology gives us a head start over the competition"... if you try to maintain the three word slogan, taking the translation through the alternate meanings jbetak suggested gets you there...  YggdrasilsRoot 20:24, 9 August 2005 (UTC):::::I don't think the site Jbetak links to above implies that Audi ever used the English phrase "Advantage through Technology" in its advertising.  Rather, they've always used "Vorsprung durch Technik", and "Advantage through Technology" is that particular website's translation of the phrase.  Nevertheless, I do agree that "Advantage through Technology" is the snappiest possible English translation. ("Competitive Edge through Technology", while being a more faithful translation, simply falls flat.) Angr (talk • Special:Contributions/Angr|contribs) 07:56, 28 March 2006 (UTC)::::::I (native german) would also translate "Vorsprung" as advantage.  While edge is equally fitting, "advantage through technology" has a better "feel" to it and doesn't mingle with the original balance of the slogan. "edge through technology" shifts the emphasis too much towards the end due to the discrepancy in both words' length. -- Benjamin, May 7th:::::::FWIW, the BBC translates it as "Progress through Technology".

Ossilator (talk) 20:38, 18 November 2014 (UTC)Marque status (luxury)Audi? Luxury? // LiftarnI am sorry that I have to disagree with you again but yes Audi is a luxury marque.For whatever it's worth - Audi positioned itself as competition to BMW in late 70s and early 80s.  In turn, BMW started positioning itself as competition to Mercedes in late 60s and early 70s.  BMW has long attained the status of a Mercedes' heir apparent, even outselling Daimler in its own market segment for the first time in recent years.  Audi's brand might not appear as established in the luxury market; BMW has about a decade advantage on them.Jbetak 06:33, 12 October 2005 (UTC):Neither BMW nor Mercedes (perhaps with the exception of some Mercedes models) are luxury, they are premium cars.  Luxury cars are designed and built to provide the utmost of style and comfort.  Often they are at least partially hand built and often also according to customer specifications.  I find it hard to fit a compact car like Audi A2 into that description. // Liftarn:I figured out that our disagreement is due to our difference in catergorical terms.  Rolls Royce and Bentley are not luxury cars.  They are ultra-luxury marques.  Luxury and Premium automobiles are synonomous.I disagree. // Liftarn 12:40, 13 October 2005 (UTC)But if Luxury and Premium automobiles are synonomous then why not call it "Premium" then? // Liftarn 08:41, 17 October 2005 (UTC)::I was about to post something along the same lines, but to your edit prevented mine from being saved ;-) Let me at least post the link I quickly grabbed from German Google: All of the three German brands have models positioned below this class as well. The sematics and culutral use is quite likely different between Germany and the US .::Jbetak 16:53, 12 October 2005 (UTC):::Is some models enough to classify the entire brand as luxury? // Liftarn 12:40, 13 October 2005 (UTC)::::That's a good point. What would you call Lexus then - a brand specifically created to host Toyota's luxury models. Right or wrong, is it perceived as a luxury brand today - some 15 years after its inception? And how about Toyota? And Hyundai has a [luxury model] now too. Jbetak 16:04, 13 October 2005 (UTC)I would call Lexus "Toyota" (or "a rebadged Toyota"). I would call it Toyota's premium or prestige brand. If the bar for what constitues luxury would be lowered then almost every brand would have to be called luxury since almost every brand has a model badged as De Luxe, GL (Grand Luxe) or a version thereof (GLE, GLi et.c.). Then even Nissan Micra would become a luxury automobile since it has a Grand Luxe model. // LiftarnIn the US Mercedes and Audi sell only their upper range models.  The lower range models you see in Germany are not available.  This allows (particularly Mercedes)to have the luxury brand image.  It's all marketing.74.130.52.177 05:01, 3 December 2007 (UTC)multitronic gearbox linkI created the multitronic article in order to link to it from this Audi article, but it was removed sometime and now there's no mention of multitronic on the page at all.

LighthouseJ 17:28, 23 May 2006 (UTC)::I do agree with the idea that the claim "Audi leads the way" is highly subjective. To "lead the way" in automotive industry it's very complex concept, there's no authority who can determine which company "leads the way", and it can not be proven (the claim "the world is round" can be proven). For me, and so many colleagues, Audi does not (and did not) lead the way in technological advances in automotive industry. Even more, Audi has been always a step ahead other German manufacturers, not only in technology, but in quality. Since the 1990's, Audi's desperate effort to be included in the "Porsche/Mercedes-Benz/BMW" premium class, has been an intense race, in which Audi has improved prices before technology.

It can be searched for in the archives of National Review at or seen online in full text at:I would be interested in more sources for this as well, since I'm familiar with this story as a child who grew up in a family that is rather fond of Audis and purchased them from before the scandal, through the court case and after Audi's name was cleared, all the way to the present day.  My understanding is that there was a court case where a woman ran over her own child with an Audi, and sued Audi with this claim that Audis accelerate by themselves.  The jury cleared Audi of all charges despite the extremely sympathetic plaintiff, since apparently it was demonstrated to their satisfaction that such spontaneous acceleration overriding the brake pedal was impossible (under the conditions described).  According to my parents, the media covered the trial well, but said nothing about the exoneration at the end.  The whole business smells like an attempt to sabotage Audi to me, although I'm willing to accept that it's simply yellow journalism rather than a conspiracy, but I just find it interesting that everyone at the time bought the story, and now everyone has forgotten that the whole thing happened... nobody in my generation is familiar with the story. --Skyfaller 06:31, 15 November 2006 (UTC)::Our family was also really fond of Audi, and owned two. The second one, a red 5000, did however unintendedly accelerate when I was at an intersection, and almost caused me to get into a head-on collision as I was attempting a left hand turn. I was familiar with the news at the time regarding the unintended acceleration, and the fact that the pedals were close together, so I released my foot from what I thought were both pedals, looked down and placed my foot on the brake only, the engine kept racing, and due to my leg strength, I was able to control the 5000, but I can see how a weaker person caught unaware might not be able to control the car as the rpm's were past 5000. As it was, it still took about 10-20feet to control the Audi. If it didn't happen to me, I wouldn't have believed it. As it was happening I couldn't believe it. I find it degrading that this article tries to place the blame on the driver as there was a real dangerous issue plaguing some of their cars. In my over 800,000km's driving my various cars, trucks and motorcycles, it has happened only that one time in that one Audi.

If you look at WP:EL under What to link, it includes "Is it proper in the context of the article (useful, tasteful, informative, factual, etc.)?"  I don't think it's useful in the context of an article.  Very few people are going to come to the Audi article and want to get more information by going to a VIN decoder.

Isn't that the point of navigating to the article, though?  To get more information?  What about articles like Harley-Davidson that have VIN decoding information in the article.

"Very few people are going to come to the Audi article and want to get more information '''by going to a VIN decoder'''".
