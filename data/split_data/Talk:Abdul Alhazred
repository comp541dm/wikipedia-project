The only exception to this is ''The Nameless City'' and this is when the idea of the Necronomicon and that which was to become the Cthulhu Mythos was still in the earliest stages of development. Hence The "M" should always be capitalised as Lovecraft's work uses the word not as insult or description but as a title and "Mad Arab" can be used as a synonym for Abdul Alhazred.: Actually, in the corrected Arkham House editions of Lovecraft's works (based on original manuscripts and early publications), the "m" is ''not capitalised even once''. Thus, the form "Mad Arab" does not ccur at all in Lovecraft, whereas "mad Arab" does. The article should be changed accordingly.Special:Contributions/83.254.52.177|83.254.52.177 (talk) 00:08, 12 February 2008 (UTC)---All of this info about Abdul Alhazred sounds like it was created by an advertising agency to create buzz for a movie that premiered a trailer at the Transformers movie.

Alhazred was created at least 70 years ago, if not longer in Lovecraft's head.Invisible CreatureWhat was the invisible creature supposed to be? A shoggoth? One of those half-children of Yog-Sothoth?

Lovecraft or Alhazred?  Also, why should we care at all about Abdul Alhazred?''''Because a lot of people think he may have existed, and probably for the same sorts of reasons some other misguided folk might be interested in the improbable activities of the likes of J Christ esq....  Because they are incapable of discerning the difference between fact and fantasy. ''I think we should care because sjc does and because people care to read it, but please do tell us more about this fascinating Abdul Alhazred-character (seems like some archetype pre-renaissance arab scientist) Special:Contributions/Sjc|Sjc (talk) 20:49, 11 July 2001The reason why he should be called Abdul Hazred should be explained.  Lovecraft didn't know enough about Arabic names to know that abdul is really abd-al = "servant of the" so abd-al-hazred would be "Servant of hazred" hazred="that which is coming" I think.  I'm not near my dictionary.  But "Abdul Alhazred" means "Servant of ''the the'' thing which is to come"  I won't edit it myself because it'd be better for a native speaker to explain.Also, is an encyclopedia really the place for criticizing Christianity?  I thought it's supposed to pretend to be objective.Special:Contributions/128.220.29.161|128.220.29.161 (talk) 20:30, 23 August 2004User:LinkBot/suggestions/Abdul_Alhazred|Link suggestionsAn automated Wikipedia link suggester has some possible wiki link suggestions for the Abdul_Alhazred article, and they have been placed on User:LinkBot/suggestions/Abdul_Alhazred|this page for your convenience.''Tip:'' Some people find it helpful if these suggestions are shown on this talk page, rather than on another page.

You can look upon Lovecraft's 'Abdul Alhazred' as the later medieval form of the name. It's probably not simply a case of Lovecraft mixing up his Arabic. Alexander 007 08:59, 29 May 2005 (UTC):You mean like Alhazen or Alfarabius. That is what TV Tropes would call Fridge Brilliance. Of course that website did not exist when you made that comment, over a decade ago. Maybe someone will add to this "conversation" in 2025.--Bellerophon5685 (talk) 04:46, 14 October 2015 (UTC)Al Hazred's true nameI'm arab. The name "Abdul AlHazred" could not exist because of two reasons:'''1)''' The grammatic nature of the name is incorrect. The word "Abdul" consists of "Abd" + "Al". In Arabic, they're mixed to form the word "Abdul". So if we wrote the name in the original grammatic form, it would be "Abd Al Al Hazred". And this is totally wrong.(by the way, "Abd" means "Slave" while "Al" means "The" - in English)'''2)''' Al Hazred was known to have lived in the "Ammawi" era, i.e. During Islam. Thus, he could never be named "Abd Al Hazred" as this would be a clear denial of his belief in Allah, the name of God in Islam.The most suggested name is: '''Abdullah Al Hazred'''.[Abdullah = Abd + Allah] = The slave of God[Al Hazred] is just another surname.The other curtain thing is that Al Hazrad is the real author of "The Necronomicon", and not Lovecraft or any other person Special:Contributions/Haisook|Haisook (talk) 20:47, 21 August 2005:Curtain?

For those of you who need to brush up on your research, I suggest:::1.) Donald Tyson's " Necronomicon, The Wanderings of Alhazred"::2.) Simon's "Dead Names: Dark History of the Necronomicon"::3.)

Special:Contributions/4.68.249.1|4.68.249.1 (talk) 12:24, 19 February 2007:::Because 10 minutes of research reveals that Lovecraft was the first person to mention the Necronomicon.  There are no earlier references, and Lovecraft said many times that it is a book of his own invention. Special:Contributions/216.26.131.217|216.26.131.217 (talk)  05:46, 21 April 2007While you're translating the name, what about "Hazred"? Does that have any meaning in Arabic? It quite possibly might not (since by Lovecraft's own admission it was a name he used for himself as a child) but if it did, that would probably be good information to add to the article.  Special:Contributions/140.198.155.85|140.198.155.85 (talk)  09:37, 22 March 2007I have read an article on the subject of Abdul Alhazreds name (and names in Lovecraftian Mythos in general) from the 4th edition of the rulebook for Call of Cthulhu. While I know this may not be a valid source, the (ficitional) writer of the document claimed that the name of "Abdul Alhazred" doesn't make sense and the real name was "Abd Al-Azred", meaning "Worshipper of the Devourer"´, and that the name has then changed over time by mistakes done by the various "translators".While none in Arabia in that time would name anyone "Worshipper of the devourer" it can be believed that abd(ul) changed his name later on when he 'realized the truth' about the universe.Again, I point out that this is a belief issued by the author of CoC and thus may not be a valid source, more a theory.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/213.32.37.3|213.32.37.3 (talk) 10:30, 29 April 2008 (UTC);;; ;;:Neither.  It's a game.  It's ''fiction'', based on fiction.  It's not a reliable source for research.  Do you consult the rules for ''Candy Land'' while writing an encyclopedia article on chocolate manufacturing?  It makes for a better gaming atmosphere to say that the name means "Worshipper of the Devourer", but it has even less basis in fact than the character himself.  I'd like to point out that the morphemes ''azrad'' and ''hazred''/''hazrad'' are the same and have the same meaning.  To jump from "Servant of the Great Lord" (and "the Prohibited" is a bit of a stretch; the sense of ''hazrat'' is of exerting control, over an area or a set of objects, thus it can mean a warlord or the area acquired/controlled by him, it has nothing to do with "forbidden knowledge" as the editor was implying) to "Worshipper of the Devourer" takes a deliberate effort to spin the meaning.  The authors of ''CoC'' were deliberately equating "great lord" with "Great Old One" or something similar, whereas no such interpretation is linguistically valid.

In fact, the story that introduces Abdul, "The Nameless City", also uses the lowercase form: "mad Arab". Abdul is also variously referred to as the "mad poet". I suspect that whoever added this piece of information simply made the assumption that "Mad Arab" was some sort of official designation.
