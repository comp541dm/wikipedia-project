3"I couldn't care less"The article says 'Both BrE and AmE use the expression "I couldn't care less" to mean the speaker does not care at all.'But, we very often hear Americans using "I could care less" when they really mean "I couldn't care less". The former, which is heard often (e.g. on US TV and films) is logically incorrect, and confusing to British ears, so possibly worth mentioning?— Preceding unsigned comment added by 212.44.19.62 (talk • Special:Contributions/212.44.19.62|contribs) 17:51, 7 November 2011‎ (UTC);;;BrE and AmE are ugly, confusing acronyms that reflect lazy writingThe acronyms "BrE" and "AmE" are not only visually ugly; they make the article harder to read because they are not known to general readers. Therefore, if a reader just drops down to a particular section -- rather than reading the lead paragraph where the acronyms are defined -- he will not know what he's reading. This is particularly unfortunate in an encyclopedia article that is supposed to be a reference source and (obviously) is not meant to be read from start to finish in one sitting like it's a novel. Writing should be reader-friendly, not lazy-writer friendly. I don't think it's an onerous burden to ask writers to write in whole words when doing so makes life easier for the reader.— Preceding unsigned comment added by Rsquire3 (talk • Special:Contributions/Rsquire3|contribs) 14:29, 15 May 2013‎ (UTC);;;:I regret to defer with you, unsigned commenter. The acronyms are there to prevent the cacophony that is caused if we repeat the terms "American English" and "British English" more than once in the article. It is expected that, after having read the article's title, one knows just what the abbreviations AmE and BrE mean. --Fandelasketchup (talk) 13:09, 9 November 2015 (UTC)Suggestion for improving the articleI think it's worth mentioning in the article that American pop singer Britney Spears used a British word for the title of one of the unreleased tracks on her debut album, "...Baby One More Time", said song being called "Autumn Goodbye" instead of "Fall Goodbye".

In the case of '12 August 2003' it is shown as 12/08/2003.When separating date elements by dashes it is customary to use British style dates with leading zeroes, thus 04-Jul-1996.
