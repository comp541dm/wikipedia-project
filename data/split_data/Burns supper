File:Robert burns.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Burns (1759–1796)Haggis at a Burns supperA '''Burns supper''' is a celebration of the life and poetry of the poet Robert Burns, author of many Scots poems. The suppers are normally held on or near the poet's birthday, 25 January, rarely also known as '''Robert Burns Day''' (or '''Robbie Burns Day''' or '''Rabbie Burns Day''') or more commonly '''Burns Night''' (Burns Nicht), although they may in principle be held at any time of the year.HistoryThe first supper was held ''in memoriam'' at Burns Cottage by Robert Burns' friends on 21 July 1801, the fifth anniversary of his death, and have been a regular occurrence ever since. The first still extant Burns club was founded in Greenock in 1801 by merchants born in Ayrshire, some of whom had known Burns. They held the first Burns supper on what they thought was his birthday, 29 January 1802, but in 1803 they discovered in Ayr parish records that his date of birth was 25 January 1759. Since then, suppers have been held on or about 25 January.Burns suppers may be formal or informal. Both typically include haggis (a traditional Scottish dish celebrated by Burns in ''Address to a Haggis''), Scotch whisky, and the recitation of Burns's poetry. Formal dinners are hosted by organisations such as Burns clubs, the Freemasons, or St Andrews Societies and occasionally end with dancing when ladies are present. Formal suppers follow a standard format.Order of the supperPiping in the guestsA piper generally greets the guests, who gather and mix as at any informal party.bbcAt less formal gatherings traditional Scottish music is played.Host's welcoming speech;/div;The host says a few words welcoming everyone to the supper and perhaps stating the reason for it.["Burns Night", BBC]All of the guests are seated and grace is said, usually using the ''Selkirk Grace'', a well-known thanksgiving said before meals, using the Scots language. Although attributed to Burns, the Selkirk Grace was already known in the 17th century, as the "Galloway Grace" or the "Covenanters' Grace". It came to be called the Selkirk Grace because Burns was said to have delivered it at a dinner given by the Earl of Selkirk.Image:RCMP_Pipe_Band_piping_in_the_Haggus.JPG|thumb|right|Piping in the haggisThe Selkirk Grace:Some hae meat an: canna eat,:And some wad eat that want it;:But we hae meat, and we can eat,:And sae let the Lord be thankit.bbcSoup courseThe supper starts with the soup course.  Normally a Scottish soup such as Scotch broth, potato soup, cullen skink, or cock-a-leekie is served.The haggis"Piping" of the haggisEveryone stands as the haggis is brought in. It is usually brought in by the cook on a large dish, generally while a piper plays bagpipes and leads the way to the host's table, where the haggis is laid down. They might play "A Man's A Man for A' That", "Robbie Burns Medley" or "The Star O' Robbie Burns".Archie Cairns – Book 1 Pipe Music 1995 The host, or perhaps a guest, then recites the ''Address to a Haggis''Great chieftain o' the puddin-raceImage:Bob Purdie addressing haggis 20040124.jpg|thumb|right|Addressing the haggisAddress to a HaggisAddress to a Haggis{||-| rowspan="9" style="vertical-align:top;"||-|Fair fa' your honest, sonsie face,Great chieftain o' the puddin-race!Aboon them a' ye tak your place,Painch, tripe, or thairm:Weel are ye wordy o' a graceAs lang's my arm.|valign="top"|(fa = fall, sonsie = jolly/cheerful)(aboon = above)(painch = paunch/stomach, thairm = intestine)(wordy = worthy)|-|The groaning trencher there ye fill,Your hurdies like a distant hill,Your pin wad help to mend a millIn time o' need,While thro' your pores the dews distilLike amber bead.|valign="top"|(hurdies = buttocks)|-|His knife see rustic Labour dicht,An' cut you up wi' ready slicht,Trenching your gushing entrails bricht,Like ony ditch;And then, O what a glorious sicht,Warm-reekin, rich!|valign="top"|(dicht = wipe, here with the idea of sharpening)(slicht = skill)(reekin= steaming)|-|Then, horn for horn, they stretch an' strive:Deil tak the hindmaist! on they drive,Till a' their weel-swall'd kytes belyve,Are bent like drums;Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive,"Bethankit" hums.|valign="top"|(deil = devil)(swall'd = swollen, kytes = bellies, belyve = soon)(bent like = tight as)(auld Guidman = the man of the house, rive = tear, i.e. burst)|-|Is there that o're his French ragoutOr olio that wad staw a sow,Or fricassee wad mak her spewWi' perfect scunner,Looks down wi' sneering, scornfu' viewOn sic a dinner?|valign="top"|(olio = stew, from Spanish ''olla'/stew pot, staw = make sick)(scunner = disgust)|-|Poor devil! see him ower his trash,As feckless as a wither'd rash,His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash,His nieve a nit;Thro' bloody flood or field to dash,O how unfit!|valign="top"|(nieve = fist, nit = nut, i.e. tiny)|-|But mark the Rustic, haggis fed,The trembling earth resounds his tread.Clap in his wallie nieve a blade,He'll mak it whistle;An' legs an' arms, an' heads will sned,Like taps o' thristle.|valign="top"|(wallie = mighty, nieve = fist)(sned = cut off)(thristle = thistle)|-|Ye Pow'rs wha mak mankind your care,And dish them out their bill o' fare,Auld Scotland wants nae skinkin wareThat jaups in luggies;But, if ye wish her gratefu' prayer,Gie her a haggis!|valign="top"|(skinkin ware = watery soup)(jaups = slops about, luggies = two-handled continental bowls)|}At the line ''His knife see rustic Labour dicht'' the speaker normally draws and sharpens a knife, and at the line ''An' cut you up wi' ready slicht'', plunges it into the haggis and cuts it open from end to end.  When done properly this "ceremony" is a highlight of the evening.Main courseHaggis platter at a Burns supper in the USHaggis served wi tatties an neeps (with potatoes and turnips)At the end of the poem, a whisky toast will be proposed to the haggis, then the company will sit down to the meal. The haggis is traditionally served with mashed potatoes (tatties) and mashed turnips (neeps).vsOther coursesA dessert course, cheese courses, coffee, etc, may also be part of the meal. The courses normally use traditional Scottish recipes. For instance, dessert may be cranachan or tipsy laird (whisky trifle), followed by oatcakes and cheese, all washed down with the "water of life" (uisge beatha) – Scotch whisky.ToastsWhen the meal reaches the coffee stage various speeches and toasts are given. In order, the core speeches and toasts are as follows.Immortal memoryThe main speaker gives a speech, remembering some aspect of Burns' life or poetry. This may be light-hearted or serious and may include the recitation of a poem or song by Burns. A toast to the Immortal Memory of Robert Burns then follows.vsAddress to the LassiesThis was originally a short speech given by a male guest in thanks to the women who had prepared the meal. However, nowadays it is much more wide-ranging and generally covers the male speaker's view on women. It is normally amusing but not offensive, particularly bearing in mind that it will be followed by a reply from the "lassies" concerned. The men drink a toast to the women's health.Reply to the LaddiesThis is occasionally (and humorously) called the "Toast to the Laddies" and, like the previous toast, it is generally quite wide-ranging nowadays. A female guest will give her views on men and reply to any specific points raised by the previous speaker. Like the previous speech, this should be amusing, but not offensive. Quite often the speakers giving this toast and the previous one will collaborate so that the two toasts complement each other.Works by BurnsAfter the speeches there may be singing of songs by Burns – ''Ae Fond Kiss'', ''Parcel o' Rogues'', ''A Man's a Man'', etc. – and more poetry – ''To a Mouse'', ''To a Louse'', ''Tam o' Shanter'', ''The Twa Dugs'', ''Holy Willie's Prayer'', etc. This may be done by the individual guests or by invited experts, and it goes on for as long as the guests wish and may include other works by poets influenced by Burns, particularly poets writing in Scots. Foreign guests can also be invited to sing or say works from their land.ClosingFinally the host will call on one of the guests to give the vote of thanks, after which everyone is asked to stand, join hands, and sing '' Auld Lang Syne '' bringing the evening to an end.See also* Scottish cuisineReferencesExternal linksBurns supper*[A 2007 Supper for Mauchline Burns Club, presented with explanations of each stage]**[Address to the Unco Guid or the rigidly righteous ]*[A film recording of the 145th Burns Supper] from 1971 at the Irvine Burns Club.
