Bayonne (disambiguation)'''Bayonne''' (; Gascon: ''Baiona'' ; Baiona ; Bayona) is a city and commune and one of the two sub-prefectures of the department of Pyrénées-Atlantiques, in the Aquitaine region of south-western France.LionIt is located at the confluence of the Nive and Adour rivers in the northern part of the cultural region of Basque Country as well as the southern part of Gascony where the Aquitaine basin joins the beginning of the Pre-Pyrenees.Together with nearby Anglet, Biarritz, Saint-Jean-de-Luz, and several smaller communes, Bayonne forms an urban area with 288,359 inhabitants at the 2012 census,  45,855 of whom lived in the city of Bayonne proper.The communes of Bayonne, Biarritz, and Anglet have joined into an intercommunal entity called the ''Agglomération Côte Basque-Adour'' (formerly ''Communauté d'agglomération de Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz (BAB)'' prior to 2010).The site on the left bank of the Nive and the Adour was probably occupied before ancient times as a fortified enclosure was attested in the 1st century at the time when the Tarbelli occupied the territory. Archaeological studies have confirmed the presence of a Roman castrum, a stronghold in Novempopulania at the end of the 4th century before the city was populated by the Vascones.In 1023 Bayonne was the capital of Labourd and, in the 12th century, extended to and beyond the Nive. At that time the first bridge was built over the Adour. The city came under the domination of the English in 1152 through the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine: it became militarily and, above all, commercially important thanks to maritime trade. It was separated from the Viscount of Labourd in 1177 by Richard the Lion Heart. In 1451 the city was taken by the Crown of France after the Hundred Years War. The loss of trade with the English and the silting up of the river as well as the movement of the city towards the north weakened it. The district of Saint-Esprit developed anyway thanks to the arrival of a Jewish population fleeing the Spanish Inquisition. From this community Bayonne gained its reputation for chocolate. The course of the Adour was changed in 1578 under the direction of Louis de Foix and the river returned to its former mouth, returning business lost to Bayonne lost business for over a hundred years. In the 17th century the city was fortified by Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban. In 1814 Bayonne and its surroundings were the scene of fighting between the Napoleonic troops and the Spanish-Anglo-Portuguese coalition led by the Duke of  Wellington: the city then underwent its final siege.In 1951 the Lacq gas field was discovered whose extracted sulphur and associated oil are shipped from the port of Bayonne. During the second half of the 20th century many housing estates were built forming new districts on the periphery and the city was extended to form a conurbation with Anglet and  Biarritz: this agglomeration became the heart of a vast Basque-Landes urban area.Bayonne was, in 2014, a commune with over 45,000 inhabitants, the heart of the urban area of Bayonne and of the ''Agglomeration Côte Basque-Adour'' which includes Anglet and Biarritz. It is an important part of the Basque ''Bayonne-San Sebastián Eurocity'' and it plays the role of economic capital of the Adour basin. Modern industry -  metallurgy and chemicals  - are established to take advantage of procurement opportunities and sea shipments through the harbour. It is now mostly business services which today represent the largest source of employment. Bayonne is also a cultural capital, a city with strong Basque and Gascon influences and a rich historical past. Its heritage lies in its architecture, the diversity of collections in museums, its gastronomic specialties, and traditional events such as the famous Fêtes de Bayonne.The inhabitants of the commune are known as ''Bayonnais'' or ''Bayonnaises''.GeographyBayonne is located in the south-west of France on the western border between Basque Country and Gascony. It developed at the confluence of the Adour and its tributary on the left bank, the Nive, 6km from the Atlantic coast. The commune was part of the Basque province of Labourd.MappingA list of online mapping systems can be displayed by clicking on the coordinates (latitude and longitude) in the top right hand corner of this article.Neighbouring communes and villagesGoogleGeology and ReliefBayonne occupies a territory characterized by a flat relief to the west and to the north towards the Landes forest, tending to slightly raise towards the south and east. The city has developed at the confluence of the Adour and Nive 6km from the ocean. The meeting point of the two rivers coincides with a narrowing of the Adour valley. Above this the alluvial plain extends for nearly thirty kilometres towards both Tercis-les-Bains and Peyrehorade, and is characterized by swampy meadows called ''barthes'' which are influenced by floods and high tides.In Gascony and in Basque country alluvial floodplains along a river are called ''barthe'' (from the gascon ''barta'') Downstream from this point the river has shaped a large bed in the sand dunes creating a significant bottleneck at the confluence.The occupation of the hill that dominates this narrowing of the valley developed through a gradual spread across the lowlands by building embankments and the aggradation from flood soil.The Nive has played a leading role in the development of the Bayonne river system in recent geological time by the formation of alluvial terraces that form the sub-soil of Bayonne beneath the surface accumulations of silt and aeolian sands. The drainage network of the western Pre-Pyrenees evolved mostly from the Quaternary from south-east to northwest oriented east-west. The Adour was then captured by the gaves and this system, together with the Nive, led to the emergence of a new alignment of the lower Adour and the Adour-Nive confluence. This capture has been dated to the early Quaternary (80,000 years ago).;ref group=PH name=p3Before this capture the Nive had deposited pebbles from the Mindel glaciation of medium to large sizes that slowed erosion of the hills causing the bottleneck at Bayonne. After the deposit of the lowest alluvial terrace (10 to 15 metres high at Grand Bayonne), the course of the Adour became fixed in its lower reaches.;ref group=PH name=p3Subsequent to these deposits there was a rise in sea level in the Holocene period (from 15,000 to 5000 years ago) which explains the invasion of the lower valleys with fine sand, peat, and mud with a thickness of more than 40 metres below the current bed of the Adour and the Nive in Bayonne. These same deposits are spread across the barthes.;ref group=PH name=p4In the late Quaternary the topographic physiognomy we know today was formed - i.e. a set of hills overlooking a swampy lowland. The promontory of Bassussarry - Marracq ultimately extended to the labourdin foothills, dying out at the Grand Bayonne hill is an example. Similarly, on the right bank of the Nive, the heights of Chateau-Neuf (Mocoron Hill) met the latest advance of the plateau of Saint-Pierre-d'Irube (height 30 to 35 metres).;ref group=PH name=p4On the right bank of the Adour the heights of Castelnau (today the citadel) with an altitude of 35 to 40 metres, and Fort (today Saint-Esprit) with an altitude of 20 to 25 metres rise above the Barthes of the Adour, the Nive, Bourgneuf, Saint-Frédéric, Sainte-Croix, Aritxague, and Pontots.;ref group=PH name=p4The area of the commune is 2168 hectares and its altitude varies between 0 and 55 metres., published by the Institut géographique nationalHydrographyFile:Bayonne Adour HdV.jpg|thumb|The confluence of the Adour and the Nive from the right bank of the Adour.The city is traversed by the Adour., Sandre website, consulted on 25 July 2014  The river is part of the Natura 2000 network from its source at Bagnères-de-Bigorre to its exit to the Atlantic Ocean after Bayonne, between Tarnos (Landes) for the right bank and Anglet (Pyrénées-Atlantiques) for the left bank., Institution Adour website, consulted on 23 August 2014 [Page FR7200724 Natura 2000], National Inventory of Natural heritage website, consulted on 23 August 2014Apart from the Nive, which converges on the left bank of the Adour after 79.3 kilometres of a sometimes tumultuous course, two tributaries join the Adour in Bayonne commune: the ''Ruisseau de Portou'' and the ''Ruisseau du Moulin Esbouc''. Tributaries of the Nive are the ''Ruisseau de Hillans'' and the ''Ruisseau d'Urdaintz'' which both rise in the commune.GeoClimateThe nearest weather station is that of Biarritz-Anglet.The climate of Bayonne is relatively similar to that of its neighbour Biarritz, described below, with fairly heavy rainfall; The oceanic climate is due to the proximity of the Atlantic Ocean. The average winter temperature is around 8°C and is around 20°C in summer. The lowest temperature recorded was -12.7°C on 16 January 1985 and the highest 40.6°C on 4 August 2003. Rains on the Basque coast are rarely persistent except during winter storms. They often take the form of intense thunderstorms of short duration.Communication and transportFile:Transport interurbain autour de Bayonne 03092014.png|thumb|Public transport around Bayonne: railway lines are black, the intercity bus lines Pyrénées-Atlantiques are green and those of Landes purple. The PTU (perimeter of urban transport, which operates the Chronoplus network is uncharted here) is bounded by a red line.Means of transport (water, roads, bridges, and railways).Road communicationsBayonne is located at the intersection of the A63 autoroute (Bordeaux-Spain) and the D1 extension of the A64 autoroute (towards Toulouse). The city is served by three interchanges - two of them on the A63: exit 6 (Bayonne Nord) serves the northern districts of Bayonne but also allows quick access to the centre while exit 5 (Bayonne Sud) provides access to the south and also serves Anglet. The third exit is the D1 / A64 via the Mousserolles interchange (exit 1 Bayonne Mousserolles) which links the district of the same name and also serves the neighbouring communes of Mouguerre and Saint-Pierre-d'Irube.Bayonne was traversed by Route nationale 10 connecting Paris to Hendaye but this is now downgraded to a departmental road D810. Route nationale 117, linking Bayonne to Toulouse has been downgraded to departmental road D817.BridgesFile:Bayonne Adour.jpg|thumb|The Saint-Esprit bridge over the Adour.There are several bridges over both the Nive and the Adour linking the various districts.Coming from upstream on the Adour there is the A63 bridge, then the Saint-Frédéric bridge which carries the D 810, then the railway bridge that replaced the old Eiffel iron bridge, the Saint-Esprit bridge, and finally the Grenet bridge. The Saint-Esprit bridge connects the Saint-Esprit district to the Amiral-Bergeret dock just upstream of the confluence with the river Nive. In 1845 the old bridge, originally made ??of wood, was rebuilt in masonry with seven arches supporting a deck 230 metres wide. It was then called the Nemours Bridge in honour of Louis of Orleans, sixth Duke of Nemours, who laid the first stone. The bridge was finally called Saint-Esprit. Until 1868 the bridge had a moving span near the left bank. It was expanded in 1912 to facilitate the movement of horse-drawn carriages and motor vehicles.;ref group=FL name=p118On the Nive coming from upstream to downstream there is the A63 bridge then the ''Pont Blanc'' (White bridge)The successor to the iron railway bridge ''Raccordement d'Aïtachouria'', the Pont Blanc has been used since 2003 to link the ''Floride Sports Field'' to the wilderness area on the Ansot plain. railway bridge, and then D810 bridge, the Génie bridge (or ''Pont Millitaire''), the Pannecau bridge, the Marengo bridgeThe Marengo masonry bridge was under Napoleon III. leading to the covered markets, and the Mayou Bridge The Pannecau bridge was long named ''Bertaco bridge'' and was rebuilt in masonry under Napoleon III.

Bicycle paths are located along the left bank of the Adour, a large part of the left bank of the Nive, and along various axes of the city where there are some bicycle lanes. The city offers free bicycles on loan.,  Bayonne official website, consulted on 6 October 2014Public transportUrban NetworkMost of the lines of the ''Chronoplus'' bus network operated by the ''Transdev agglomeration of Bayonne'' link Bayonne to other communes in the urban transport perimeter: Anglet, Biarritz, Bidart, Boucau, Saint-Pierre-d'Irube and Tarnos[''Chronoplus Network Map''], consulted on 25 July 2014 . The Bayonne free shuttle Bayonne serves the city centre (Grand and Petit Bayonne) by connecting several parking stations; other free shuttles perform other short trips within the commune.Interurban networksBayonne is connected to many cities in the western half of the department such as Saint-Jean-de-Luz and Saint-Palais, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Saint-Palais by the Pyrenees-Atlantiques long distance coach network of ''Transport 64'' managed by the General Council. Since the network restructuring in the summer of 2013, the lines converge on Bayonne., Transports 64, consulted on 11 September 2014 . Bayonne is also served by services from the Landes departmental network, ''XL'R''., consulted on 11 September 2014 .Rail transportThe Gare de Bayonne is located in the Saint-Esprit district and is an important station on the Bordeaux-Irun railway. It is also the terminus of lines leading from Toulouse to Bayonne and from Bayonne to Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port. It is served by TGV, Intercités, Lunéa, and TER Aquitaine trains (to Hendaye, Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, Dax, Bordeaux, Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau, and Tarbes).Air transportBayonne is served by the Biarritz – Anglet – Bayonne Airport (IATA code: BIQ • ICAO code: LFBZ), located on the communal territories of Anglet and Biarritz. The airport was returned to service in 1954 after repair of damage from bombing during the Second World War.Airport management is carried out by the joint association for the development and operation of the airport of Biarritz-Anglet-Bayonne, which includes the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Bayonne Basque Country, the agglomeration of Côte Basque-Adour, the departments of Pyrénées-Atlantiques and Landes, and the commune of Saint-Jean-de-Luz. The airport of Biarritz-Anglet-Bayonne had nearly 1.1 million passengers in 2013., Sud-Ouest, 1 October 2013, consulted on 22 August 2014  It has regular connections to Paris-Orly, Paris-CDG, Lyon, Nice, Geneva, and London Stansted and from March to October 2014 had connections with: Aéroport de Marseille Provence|Marseille, Aéroport de Strasbourg-Entzheim|Strasbourg, Aéroport de Lille-Lesquin|Lille, Brussels South Charleroi Airport, Dublin, Stockholm-Skavsta, Stockholm-Arlanda, London-Gatwick, Copenhagen, Oslo, and Helsinki.

In certain cases the element ''-onne'' follows an Indo-European theme: ''*ud-r/n'' (Greek ''húdōr'' giving hydro, Gothic ''watt'' meaning "water") hence ''*udnā'' meaning "water" giving ''unna'' then ''onno'' in the glossary of Vienne.Xavier Delamarre, ''Dictionary of the Gallic language. A linguistic approach to continental old Celtic'', éditions Errance, Paris, 2003, ISBN 2-87772-237-6, p. 48  ''Unna'' therefore would refer to the Adour. This toponymic type evoking a river traversing a locality is common. The appellative ''unna'' seems to be found in the name of the Garonne (''Garunna'' 1st century; ''Garonna'' 4th century). However it is possible to see a pre-Celtic suffix ''-ona'' in the name of the Charente (''Karantona'' in 875) or the Charentonne (''Carentona'' in 1050)., Ernest Nègre, 28 July 2014It could also be an augmentative Gascon from the original Latin radical ''Baia-'' with the suffix ''-ona' in the sense of "vast expanse of water" or a name derived from the Basque ''bai'' meaning "river" and ''ona'' meaning "good", hence "good river".The proposal by Eugene Goyheneche repeated by Manex Goyhenetche and supported by Jean-Baptiste Orpustan is ''bai una'', "the place of the river" or ''bai ona'' "hill by the river" -  ''Ibai'' means "river" in Basque and ''muinoa'' means "hill"."It has perhaps been lost from sight that many urban place names in France, from north to south, came from the element ''Bay-'' or ''Bayon-'' such as: Bayons, Bayonville, Bayonvillers and pose the unusual problem of whether they are Basque or Gascon"adds Pierre Hourmat. However, the most ancient form of Bayonne: ''Baiona'', clearly indicates a feminine or a theme of ''-a'' whereas this is not the case for Béon or Bayon. In addition, the ''Bayon-'' in Bayonville or Bayonvillers in northern France is clearly the personal Germanic name ''Baio''., Ernest Nègre, 28 July 2014Old AttestationsThe names of the Basque province of Labourd and the locality of Bayonne have been attested from an early period with the place name ''Bayonne'' appearing in the Latin form ''Lapurdum'' after a period during which the two names could in turn designate a Viscounty or Bishopric.Jean-Baptiste Orpustan,  , Presses universitaires de Bordeaux, 2006, ISBN 2 86781 396 4 p. 19, 26''Labourd'' and ''Bayonne'' were synonymous and used interchangeably until the 12th century before being differentiated: Labord for the province and Bayonne for the city.OrpustanThe attribution of Bayonne as ''Civitas Boatium'', a place mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary and by Paul Raymond in his 1863 dictionary, has been abandoned. The city of the ''Boïates'' may possibly be La Teste-de-Buch but is certainly not Bayonne.Achille Luchaire, ''Annals of the Faculty of Letters of Bordeaux (1879)'', note 12 and 24, regarding the ''Notitia Provinciarum'' mentioning the ''civitas Boatium'' (var. ''Boasium, Bohatium, Boaccensium, Boacium'') "whose identification with Bayonne, proposed by Scaliger and Valois, is absolutely inadmissible (see Desjardins, Gaule rom., II, 874, note 1)" .The following table details the origins of Labord, Bayonne, and other names in the commune.{| class="wikitable"|-!

Numerous traces of human occupation have been found in the Bayonne region from the Middle Paleolithic especially in the discoveries at Saint-Pierre-d'Irube, a neighbouring locality.Neanderthal Stone tools (from 80,000 to 45,000 BC corresponding to the Mousterian period, the Riss Glaciations, and Würm II) On the other hand, the presence of a mound about 14 metres high has been detected in the current Cathedral Quarter overlooking the Nive which formed a natural protection and a usable port on the left bank of the Nive. At the time the mound was surrounded north and west by the Adour swamps. At its foot lies the famous "Bayonne Sea" - the junction of the two rivers - which may have been about twelve hundred metres wide between Saint-Esprit and the Grand Bayonne and totally covered the current location of Bourg-Neuf (in the district of Petit Bayonne).

Dufart, 1839, 1085 pages .The archaeological discoveries of October and November 1995 provided a shred of evidence to support this projection. In the four layers of sub-soil along the foundation of the Gothic cathedral (in the "apse of the cathedral" area) a 2-metre depth was found of old objects from the end of the 1st century - in particular sigillated Gallic ceramics from Montans imitating Italian styles, thin-walled bowls, and fragments of amphorae. In the "southern sector" near the cloister door there were objects from the second half of the 1st century as well as coins from the first half of the 3rd century.In ''The Week in Basque Country'', M. Esteban, March 1996A very high probability of human presence, not solely military, seems to provisionally confirm the occupation of the site at least around the 3rd century.A Roman castrum dating to the end of the 4th century has been proven as a fortified place of Novempopulania. Named ''Lapurdum'', the name became the name of the province of ''Labourd''.The ''Notitia Dignitatum imperii Romani'', dating from 340-420 AD, mentions the seat of the tribune of the cohort of Novempopulania in these terms: "In provincia Novempopulana tribunus cohortis Novempopulanae Lapurdo" According to Eugene Goyheneche the name ''Baiona'' designated the city, the port, and the cathedral while that of ''Lapurdum'' was only a territorial designation.[''On the presumed origin of the division of the Basque language''], Hector Iglesias, consulted on 5 August 2014 . This Roman settlement was strategic as it allowed the monitoring of the trans-Pyrenean roads and of local people rebellious to the Roman power. The construction covered 6 to 10 hectares according to several authors.Renée Mussot-Goulard, ''The Gascons'', Atlantica, 2001  Gérard Coulon, ''The Gallo-Romains: life, work, beliefs, diversions - 54 BC - 486 AD'', Paris, 2006, Errance, Hespérides collection, ISBN 2-87772-331-3, p. 21 , retains the number 10 hectares. According to Eugène Goyheneche in ''Basque Country: Soule, Labourd, Lower Navarre'', Société nouvelle d’éditions régionales et de diffusion, Pau, 1979, BnF FRBNF34647711, the old Roman wall which is still visible in parts was in the shape of a polygon of 1125 metres perimeter in an area of 6 to 9 hectares.Middle AgesThe geographical location of the locality at the crossroads of a river system oriented from east to west and the road network connecting Europe to the Iberian Peninsula from north to south predisposed the site to the double role of fortress and port. The city, after being Roman, alternated between the Vascones and the English for three centuries from the 12th to the 15th century.The Romans left the city in the 4th century and the Basques, who had always been present, dominated the former Novempopulania province between the Garonne, the Ocean, and the Pyrénées. Novempopulania was renamed Vasconia and then Gascony after a Germanic deformation (resulting from the Visigoth and Frankish invasions). Basquisation of the plains region was too weak against the advance of romanization. From the mixture between the Basque and Latin language Gascon was created.Jacques Allières, ''The Basques'', Paris, Presses universitaires de France,?March 2003 (1st ed. 1997), 127 p. ISBN 213053144X and ISBN 9782130531449, OCLC 77097933.Documentation on Bayonne for the period from the High Middle Ages are virtually nonexistent.group=Note;Peter Hourmat, (''History of Bayonne from its origins to the French Revolution of 1789'', Society of Sciences Letters Arts of Bayonne,1986, P. 27 to 35 )deplores the lack of sources for the period 5th century to the 10th century: "If the existence of a major military site is attested by the remains of the tower walls of a castrum, the headquarters or refuge of a cohort in the last days of the Roman Empire, in the half a millennium that followed the collapse of the latter plunges us into an almost total ignorance of who occupied the area of the castrum and the identity of the people. A heavy silence covers the fate of Lapurdum and documents at our disposal for five centuries can be counted on the fingers of one hand and these lead to different or contradictory interpretations ... . So this story becomes a long series of question marks, for example that of Novempopulania". The Treaty of Andelot signed in 587 between Guntram, king of Burgundy, and Brunhilda of Austrasia, mentions  Lapurdo; it documents the return to Brunhilda of several cities including Aire, Couserans and ''Lapurdo'', each "with its territories" ("cum terminibus"). Manex Goyhenetche indicates that in the 6th century, the term ''civitas'' was used to designate a fortress. "The Frankish dynasties of Austrasia and Neustria by the Treaty of Andelot, consolidated their grip on part of the former territory of the ''Nine Peoples'' [...] In the 4th century Lapurdum continued to exist and by the end of the 6th century returned to its function as a fortress. Lapurdum controlled firstly the routes leading to the Pyrenean passes and secondly the cabotage routes of the Frankish fleets from Bordeaux to Asturias ".Manex Goyhenetche, General History of Basque country, Prehistory, Roman era, Middle Ages'', Vol. 1, Elkarlanean, Donostia and Bayonne, 1998, 492 pages, ISBN 2-913156-20-7, BnF FRBNF37031711, p. 134 . with the exception of two Norman intrusions: one questionable in 844 and a second attested in 892.When Labourd was created in 1023 Bayonne was the capital and the Viscount resided there. The history of Bayonne proper started in 1056 when Raymond II the Younger, Bishop of Bazas, had the mission to build the Church of Bayonne;ref group=EG name="p152"The construction was under the authority of Raymond III of Martres, Bishop of Bayonne from 1122 to 1125, combined with Viscount Bertrand for the Romanesque cathedral, the rear of which can still be seen today, and the first wooden bridge across the Adour extending the Mayou bridge over the Nive, which inaugurated the heyday of Bayonne.;ref group=EG name=p152From 1120 new districts were created under population pressure. The development of areas between the old Roman city of Grand Bayonne and the Nive also developed during this period, then between the Nive and the Adour at the place that became Petit Bayonne. A Jacobin Convent was located there in 1225 then that of the Cordeliers in 1247.;ref group=EG name=p152Construction of and modifications to the defences of the city also developed to protect the new districts.In 1130 the King of Aragon Alfonso the Battler besieged the city without success. Bayonne came under English rule happens when the Eleanor of Aquitaine married Richard I of England in 1152. This alliance gave Bayonne many commercial privileges. The Bayonnaises became carriers of Bordeaux wines and other south-western products like resin, ham, and woad to England. Bayonne was then an important military base. In 1177 King Richard separated the Viscounty of Labourd whose capital then became Ustaritz. Like many cities at the time, in 1215 Bayonne obtained the award of a municipal charter and was emancipated from feudal powers.On 12 April 1215 John, King of England, granted Bayonne a legal personality that would last throughout the Middle Ages and, to some extent, until the French Revolution. The form of the charter resembled that of La Rochelle. According to Eugene Goyheneche, "the city is governed by the "Hundred Peers" who were actually a mayor, twelve deputies, twelve councilors, and seventy-five peers who were co-opted and proposed each year by the mayor for the king's choice. The mayor was head of the administrative, judiciary, and military: he had custody of the keys to the city and some mayors were admirals in the bayonnaise fleet. The king was represented by a marshal" (source: Eugene Goyheneche, The Basque Country: Soule, Labourd, Lower Navarre, Societe new regional editions and distribution, Pau,1979 (Record BNF FRBNF34647711) .The official publication in 1273 of a Coutume unique to the city, remained in force for five centuries until the separation of Bayonne from Labourd. Relations with Labourd were often difficult and caused many bloody conflicts. The most famous of them took place in 1343 when the mayor of Bayonne, Pé de Poyane, killed five labourdin nobles: an episode which, according to Eugene Goyheneche, had its origin in a fictional story of ''On the Proudines bridge'' at Villefranque, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Villefranque, retold by Augustine Chaho and Hippolyte Taine.Bayonnaise industry at that time was dominated by shipbuilding: wood (oak, beech, chestnut from the Pyrenees, and pine from Landes) being overabundant. There was also maritime activity in providing crews for whaling, commercial marine or, and it was often so at a time when it was easy to turn any merchant ship into a warship, the English Royal Navy. For example a Bayonnais fleet participated in the Siege of Calais led by the English in 1346 which consisted of 15 vessels and 439 men (source: Eugene Goyheneche, The Basque Country: Soule, Labourd, Lower Navarre, Society new regional editions and distribution, Pau,1979 (Record BNF FRBNF34647711), p.  163. .Renaissance and modern timesFile:Bayonne place du réduit vue de la citadelle.JPG|thumb|View of the ramparts overlooking the river.File:Echauguette (Bayonne).jpg|thumb|alt=Photographie d’une échauguette de pierre blanche se détachant au-dessus d’un pont.|The Bartizan on the Redoubt, restored in 2005.The Ramparts of Bayonne.Jean de Dunois - a former companion at arms of Joan of Arc  - captured the city on 20 August 1451 and annexed it to the Crown "without making too many victims", but at the cost of a war indemnity of 40,000 gold Écus payable in a year, - thanks to the opportunism of the bishop who claimed to have seen "a large white cross surmounted by a crown which turns into a fleur-de-lis in the sky" to dissuade Bayonne from fighting against the royal troops.The siege lasted nine days from 12 to 20 August 1451 according to Pierre Hourmat, ''History of Bayonne origins to the French Revolution of 1789'', Society of Arts Science ; Arts of Bayonne,1986, p. 143.The city continued to be fortified by the kings of France to protect it from danger from the Spanish border. In 1454 Charles VII created a separate judicial district: the ''Seneschal of Lannes''Léon Cadier, , A. Picard, Paris, 1885, 92 pages, consulted 16 June 2014 . a "single subdivision of Guyenne during the English period" which had jurisdiction over a wide area including Bayonne, Dax and Saint-Sever and which exercised civil justice, criminal jurisdiction within the competence of the district councilors. Over time, the "Seneschal of the Sword" which was at Dax lost any role other than protocol and Bayonne, along with Dax and Saint-Sever, became the de facto seat of a separate Seneschal under the authority of a "lieutenant-general of the Seneschal".In May 1462 King Louis XI authorized the holding of two annual fairsTwo annual fairs: one on the first day of Lent and the other the 1st  August: "[...] grant them free fairs in perpetuity of all Aydes, imposicions, impostz and any other subsidies qualxconques, which one will be held the first day of karesme and the other on the first day of August [...]" as  established at Montferrand, Puy-de-Dôme|Montferrand in May 1462. by letters patent after signing the Treaty of Bayonne after which it was confirmed by the coutoumes of the inhabitants in July 1472 following the death of Charles de Valois, Duke de Berry, the king's brother.At the time the Spanish Inquisition raged in the Iberian Peninsula Jews left Spain, and especially Portugal, then settled in Saint-Esprit. They brought with them chocolate and the recipe for its preparation. The golden age of the city ended in the 15th century with the loss of trade with England and the silting of the port of Bayonne created by the movement of the course of the Adour to the north.At the beginning of the 16th century Labourd saw the emergence of the plague. Its path can be tracked by reading the ''Registers''.''Gascon Registers'', Vol. 1, pp. 44, 53, 141, 154, 158-159, 195, and 233 - cited by Manex Goyhenetche, ''General History of Basque Country III: Economic and social revolution from the 16th to the 18th century'', Vol. 3, Donostia / Bayonne, Elkarlanean,? 2001, 411 p. (ISBN 8483317443 and ISBN 9788483317440, OCLC 466971263), p. 42-43.  In July 1515 the city of Bayonne was "prohibited to welcome people from plague-stricken places" and on 21 October, "we  inhibit and prohibit all peasants and residents of this city [...] to go Parish Bidart [...] because of the contagion of the plague". On 11 April 1518 the plague raged in Saint-Jean-de-Luz and the city of Bayonne "inhibited and prohibited for all peasants and city inhabitants and other foreigners to maintain relationships at the location and Parish of Saint-Jean-de-Luz where people have died of the plague". On 11 November 1518 plague was present in Bayonne to the point that in 1519 the city council moved to the district of Brindos (Berindos at the time) in Anglet.Ferdinand Barbe, ''The Epidemics of pestilence in Bayonne in the 16th century'', Bulletin de la Société des sciences et lettres de Bayonne, 1947 - cited by Manex Goyhenetche, ''General History of Basque Country III: Economic and social revolution from the 16th to the 18th century'', Vol. 3, Donostia / Bayonne, Elkarlanean,? 2001, 411 p. (ISBN 8483317443 and ISBN 9788483317440, OCLC 466971263), p. 42.In 1523 Marshal Odet of Foix, Viscount of Lautrec resisted the Spaniards under Philibert of Chalon in the service of Charles V and lifted the siege of Bayonne. It was at Chateau-Vieux that the ransom demand for the release of Francis I, taken prisoner after his defeat at the Battle of Pavia, was gathered.;ref group=PiH name=p11Francis I was replaced as a captive by his two eldest sons: Francis III, Duke of Brittany, and Henry II of France who were finally released in 1530 after payment of the ransom.The meeting in 1565 between Catherine de Medici and the envoy of Philip II: the Duke of Alba, is known as the ''Interview of Bayonne''. At the time that Catholics and Protestants tore each other apart in parts of the kingdom of France, Bayonne seemed relatively untouched by these troubles.Vincent Hiribarren, ''Bayonne at the beginning of the Wars of Religion'', Revue d’histoire de Bayonne, du Pays basque et du Bas-Adour, Vol. 159, 2004, p. 95-122 . An iron fist from the city leaders did not appear to be unknown. In fact they never hesitated to use violence and criminal sanctions for keeping order in the name of the "public good".Vincent Hiribarren, , Memoir by Maitrise under the direction of Denis Crouzet, université Paris IV-Sorbonne, June 2003, 137 p.  Two brothers, Saubat and Johannes Sorhaindo who were both lieutenants of the mayor of Bayonne in the second half of the 16th century, perfectly embody this period. They often wavered between Catholicism and Protestantism but always wanted to ensure the unity and prestige of the city.Vincent Hiribarren, ''A lion at the head of a thousand sheep. the Sorhaindo family in Bayonne at the end of the 16th century'', Vol. 166, Bulletin of the Basque museum, 2005, p. 19-34.In the 16th century the king's engineers, under the direction of Louis de Foix, were dispatched to rearrange the course of the Adour by creating an estuary to maintain the river bed. The river discharged in the right place to the Ocean on 28 October 1578.} The port of Bayonne then attained a greater level of activity. Fishing for cod and whale ensured the wealth of fishermen and shipowners.From 1611-1612 the college Principal of Bayonne was a man of 26 years old with a future: Cornelius Jansen known as ''Jansénius'', the future Bishop of Ypres. Bayonne became the birthplace of Jansenism, an austere science which strongly disrupted the monarchy of Louis XIV.Pierre Hourmat, Bulletin SSLAB, Collection No. 157, ''The City of Bayonne Library'', p. 257 .Pierre Hourmat, Bulletin SSLAB, Collection No. 158, ''The City of Bayonne Library'', p. 158 .During the sporadic conflicts that troubled the French countryside from the mid 17th century, Bayonne peasants were short of powder and projectiles. They do not like the long hunting knives in the barrels of their muskets so fashioned makeshift spears later called ''bayonets''.François Noel, L. J. M. Carpentier, Puissant (Mr.), , Janet et Cotelle, 1833, p. 143  In that same century, Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban was charged by Louis XIV to fortify the city. He added a citadel built on a hill overlooking the district of ''San Espirit Cap deou do Punt''.Pierre Hourmat, ''Vauban and the fortifications of Pyrénées-Atlantiques'', Société des Sciences Lettres ; Arts de Bayonne, 1984, p. 32 .File:Bayonne-Le réduit-20110309.jpg|thumb|upright=3.0|center|The Redoubt, a system of fortifications destroyed at the beginning of the 20th century, seen from the Quaie de l'Amiral-Lesseps.French Revolution and EmpireActivity in Bayonne peaked in the 18th century. The Chamber of Commerce was founded in 1726. Trade with Spain, the Netherlands, the Antilles, the cod fishery off the shores of Newfoundland, and construction sites maintained a high level of activity in the port.In 1792 the district of Saint-Esprit (that revolutionaries renamed ''Port-de-la-Montagne'')Eugène Goyheneche, ''Our Basque Land'', Société nouvelle d’éditions régionales et de diffusion, Pau, 1979, BnF FRBNF33028848, p. 93 . located on the right bank of the Adour, was separated from the city and renamed ''Jean-Jacques Rousseau''.[Communal Notice for Saint-Esprit], consulted on 7 July 2012 . It was reunited with Bayonne on 1 June 1857. For 65 years the autonomous commune was part of the department of Landes.In 1808 at the Chateau of Marracq the act of abdication of the Spanish king Charles IV in favour of Napoleon was signed under the "friendly pressure" of the Emperor. In the process the Bayonne Statute was initialed as the first Spanish constitution.Also in 1808 the French Empire imposed on the Duchy of Warsaw the Convention of Bayonne to buy from France the debts owed to it by Prussia. The debt, amounting to more than 43 million francs in gold, was bought at a discounted rate of 21 million francs."MagocsiSedlar1974-49"However, although the duchy made its payments in installments to France over a four-year period, Prussia was unable to pay it (due to a very large indemnity it owed to France resulting from Treaties of Tilsit), causing the Polish economy to suffer heavily.Trade was the wealth of the city in the 18th century but suffered greatly in the 19th century, severely sanctioned by conflicts with Spain, its historic trading partner for the region. The Siege of Bayonne marked the end of the period with the surrender of the Napoleonic troops of Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult who were defeated by the coalition led by Wellington on 5 May 1814.Contemporary periodFile:CAP 39 - BAYONNE - La Gare.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The second Gare de Bayonne, photographed here in the 1930s.The second Gare de Bayonne succeeded an earlier station made of wood and metal built in 1854 at the beginning of the 20th centuryIn 1854 the railway arrived from Paris bringing many tourists eager to enjoy the beaches of Biarritz. Bayonne turned instead to the steel industry with the forges of the Adour.The Forges of the Adour were actually located in the commune of Boucau on the right bank of the river. The Port took on an industrial look but its slow decline seemed inexorable in the 19th century. The discovery of the Lacq gas field restored a certain dynamism.The Treaty of Bayonne was concluded on 2 December 1856. It overcame the disputes in fixing the Franco-Spanish border in the area extending from the mouth of the Bidassoa to the border between Navarre and Aragon.The city built three light railway lines to connect to Biarritz at the beginning of the 20th century. The most direct line, that of the ''Tramway Bayonne-Lycée–Biarritz'' was operated from 1888 to 1948. In addition a line further north served Anglet, operated by the ''Chemin de fer Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz'' company from 1877 to 1953. Finally a line following the Adour to its mouth and to the Atlantic Ocean by the bar in Anglet, was operated by ''VFDM réseau basque'' from 1919 to 1948.On the morning of 23 December 1933, sub-prefect Anthelme received Gustave Tissier, the director of the ''Crédit Municipal de Bayonne''. He responded well, with some astonishment, to his persistent interview. It did not surprise him to see the man unpacking what became the scam of the century."Tissier,  director of the ''Crédit Municipal'', was arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of forgery and misappropriation of public funds. He had issued thousands of false bonds in the name of ''Crédit Municipal'' [...]"This was the beginning of the Stavisky Affair which, together with other scandals and political crises, led to the Paris riots of 6 February 1934.In ''The week in Basque Country'', T.

The Pont Saint-Esprit connects Petit Bayonne with the Quartier Saint-Esprit across the Adour, where the massive Citadelle and the railway station are located. Grand Bayonne is the commercial and civic hub, with small pedestrianised streets packed with shops, plus the cathedral and City and town halls|Hôtel de Ville.The Bayonne Cathedral|Cathédrale Sainte-Marie is an imposing, elegant Gothic building, rising over the houses, glimpsed along the narrow streets.
