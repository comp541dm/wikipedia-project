'''Abu Zubaydah''' (En-us-Abu Zubaydah from Saudi Arabia pronunciation (Voice of America).ogg boo dah; , ''Abū Zubaydah''; born March 12, 1971 as '''Zayn al-Abidin Muhammad Husayn''') is a Saudi Arabian citizen currently held by the U.S. in the Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba. He is held under the authority of Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists (AUMF).Zubaydah was arrested in Pakistan in March 2002 and has been in United States custody for more than twelve years, four-and-a-half of them in the secret prison network of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).  He was transferred among prisons in various countries as part of United States rendition program. During the time in CIA custody Zubaydah was extensively interrogated; he was water-boarded 83 times and subjected to numerous other torture techniques including forced nudity, sleep deprivation, confinement in small dark boxes, deprivation of solid food, stress positions, and physical assaults. While in CIA custody, Zubaydah lost his left eye. Videotapes of some of Zubaydah's interrogations are amongst those destroyed by the CIA in 2005.It was not until September 2006 that Zubaydah, together with ten other "high-value detainees" were transferred to Guantanamo. He and other former CIA detainees are held in Camp seven (Guantanamo)#Camp seven/Camp Platinum|Camp 7, where conditions are the most isolating. At his Combatant Status Review Tribunal in 2007, Zubaydah said he was told that the CIA realized he was not significant.On July 24, 2014 the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ordered the Polish government to pay Zubaydah 100,000 euros in damages. It also awarded him 30,000 euros to cover his costs. Poland cooperated with US allowing the CIA to hold and torture Zubaydah on its territory in 2002–2003. Abu Zubaydah said through his US lawyer that he would be donating the full €100,000 in damages to victims of torture.

Wilkerson, the former chief of staff for former Secretary of State Colin Powell said:Likewise, what I have learned is that as the administration authorized harsh interrogation in April and May of 2002—well before the Justice Department had rendered any legal opinion—its principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at pre-empting another terrorist attack on the U.S. but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al-Qa'ida.So furious was this effort that on one particular detainee, even when the interrogation team had reported to Cheney's office that their detainee "was compliant" (meaning the team recommended no more torture), the VP's office ordered them to continue the enhanced methods. The detainee had not revealed any al-Qa'ida-Baghdad contacts yet. This ceased only after Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, under waterboarding in Egypt, "revealed" such contacts. Of course, later we learned that al-Libi revealed these contacts only to get the torture to stop.ArmedServicesDetaineeReport;/blockquote;ConcernsIn 2004 media coverage of Abu Zubaydah began listing him as a "disappeared" prisoner," claiming he had no access to the International Red Cross.[Reed Brody ''Prisoners who disappear'']. ''International Herald Tribune'', October 12, 2004 In February 2005, the CIA was reported as uncomfortable keeping Zubaydah in indefinite custody.Douglas Jehl, David Johnston, and Neil A. Lewis , ''International Herald Tribune'', February 16, 2005 Less than 18 months later, Zubaydah and the thirteen other high-value detainees who had been in secret CIA custody were transferred to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp., ''Washington Post'', June 20, 2006, accessed January 20, 2013After his transfer, the CIA denied access to Zubaydah. In 2008, the Office of the Inspector General, Department of Justice, complained that it had been prevented from seeing him, although it was conducting a study of the US treatment of its detainees., ''U.S. News ; World Report,'' May 20, 2008Zubaydah's mental healthSome people are concerned about Zubaydah's mental stability and how that has affected information he has given to interrogators. Ron Suskind noted in his book, ''The One Percent Doctrine: Deep Inside America's Pursuit of Its Enemies Since 9/11'' (2006), that Zubaydah was mentally ill or disabled due to a severe head injury. He described Zubaydah as keeping a diary "in the voice of three people: Hani 1, Hani 2, and Hani 3"—a boy, a young man and a middle-aged alter ego."SuskindOnePercent"Zubaydah's diaries spanned ten years and recorded in numbing detail "what he ate, or wore, or trifling things [people] said.""EggenPincusFBICIADebate"Dan Coleman, then the FBI's top al-Qaeda analyst, told a senior bureau official, "This guy is insane, certifiable, split personality.""SuskindOnePercent"According to Suskind, this judgment was "echoed at the top of CIA and was briefed to the President and Vice President.""SuskindOnePercent"Coleman stated Zubaydah was a "safehouse keeper" with mental problems, who "claimed to know more about al-Qaeda and its inner workings than he really did.""EggenPincusFBICIADebate"Joseph Margulies, Zubaydah's co-counsel, wrote in an OpEd in the ''Los Angeles Times'':Partly as a result of injuries he suffered while he was fighting the communists in Afghanistan, partly as a result of how those injuries were exacerbated by the CIA and partly as a result of his extended isolation, Zubaydah's mental grasp is slipping away. Today, he suffers blinding headaches and has permanent brain damage. He has an excruciating sensitivity to sounds, hearing what others do not. The slightest noise drives him nearly insane. In the last two years alone, he has experienced about 200 seizures. Already, he cannot picture his mother's face or recall his father's name. Gradually, his past, like his future, eludes him., ''Los Angeles Times'', April 30, 2009;/blockquote;Legal statusPresident Bush referred to Zubaydah in a speech to Congress September 2006 requesting a bill to authorize military commissions, following the US Supreme Court ruling in ''Hamdan v. Rumsfeld'' (2006) that held the tribunals as formulated by the executive branch were unconstitutional. Congress rapidly passed legislation that was signed by the president., ''Christian Science Monitor,'' September 15, 2006Less than one month after Zubaydah's capture, Justice Department officials said Zubaydah was "a near-ideal candidate for a tribunal trial."[Neail A. Lewis ''A NATION CHALLENGED: THE DETAINEES; U.S. Is Seeking Basis to Charge War Detainees'']. ''New York Times'', April 21, 2002 Several months later in 2002, US officials said there was "no rush" to try Zubaydah via military commission., ''The Miami Herald,'' December 26, 2002At his Combatant Status Review Tribunal in 2007, Zubaydah said he was told that the CIA realized he was not significant."They told me, 'Sorry, we discover that you are not Number 3, not a partner, not even a fighter,' "said Zubaydah, speaking in broken English, according to the new transcript of a Combatant Status Review Tribunal held at the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.", ''Washington Post'', 16 June 2009, accessed 21 January 2013;/blockquote;Abu Zubaydah's lawyers filed a lawsuit in July 2008 challenging his detention at Guantanamo Bay detention camps after the ''Boumediene v. Bush'' ruling. As of 2015, the judge overseeing the case, Richard W. Roberts, has failed to rule on any motions related to the case, even the preliminary ones. This has led Zubaydah's lawyers to file motion asking Judge Roberts to recuse himself for "nonfeasance" in January 2015.The judge's failure to act for nearly seven years may be related to the revelation in the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture that Zubaydah's CIA interrogators wanted him to "remain in isolation and incommunicado for the remainder of his life."The U.S. Government has not officially charged Zubaydah with any crimes.[Department of Defense Military Commissions Cases Website], April 30, 2009Joint Review Task ForceWhen he assumed office in January 2009 President Barack Obama made a number of promises about the future of Guantanamo.He promised the use of torture would cease at the camp.  He promised to institute a new review system.  That new review system was composed of officials from six departments, where the OARDEC reviews were conducted entirely by the Department of Defense.  When it reported back, a year later, the Joint Review Task Force classified some individuals as too dangerous to be transferred from Guantanamo, even though there was no evidence to justify laying charges against them. On April 9, 2013, that document was made public after a Freedom of Information Act request.Zayn al-lbidin Muhammed Husayn was one of the 71 individuals deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release.  Although Obama promised that those deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release would start to receive reviews from a Periodic Review Board less than a quarter of men have received a review.European Court of Human Rights decisionOn July 24, 2014 the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that Poland had violated the European Convention on Human Rights when it cooperated with US allowing the CIA to hold and torture Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri on its territory in 2002–2003. The court ordered the Polish government to pay each of the men 100,000 euros in damages. It also awarded Zubaydah 30,000 euros to cover his costs.See also* Shaker AamerReferences2External linksAbu ZubaydahVerbatim Transcript of Combatant Status Review Tribunal Hearing for ISN 10016CSRT Summary of Evidence memo for Zayn al Abidin Muhammad Husayn* Human Rights First;* Human Rights First;** np-zubaydah,%20abu
