NamingI think this is not good practice to list or create articles aboutbrand names (proprietary names). They come and go. Besides in differentcountries the same drug by the same manufacturer is sold under differentbrand names.There are exceptions of course we definitely should have articles about :Viagra,Valium,Prozac and possibly Rohypnol (date-rape drug ?).Can we ask the administrators to issue the official policy on brand names ofpharmaceuticals ? —The preceding unsigned comment was added by 217.99.105.xxx (talk • Special:Contributions/217.99.105.xxx|contribs) 12:03, 12 December 2001 (UTC{});----There is not yet an official policy, but personally I don't have a problem with it.If it's a subject some people want to know about, we do our readers a disservicenot to cover it just because of some misplaced concern about "commercialism".Let's face it; people won't search for "Diazepam"; they'll search for "Valium",and expect an article on it.  Of course, that article should simply say that"Valium" is a trademarked brand name for Diazepam, and then desribe what Diazepamis and what it does.  I think all should be treated similarly: mention the brandname and the generic name, and use the generic name in most of the text. --LDC 17:52, 12 December 2001----I think we can create redirects from lesser known brand names to generic namespages but we should stick to generic (or better INN - international names)throughout the text of articles possibly giving brand names at the top or inbrackets.—The preceding unsigned comment was added by Conversion script (talk • Special:Contributions/Conversion script|contribs) 16:43, 25 February 2002 (UTC{});----In the UK this stuff is sold by Almus Pharmaceuticals not GSK.

With many drugs the official names miss out on the details on the particular salt used, eg 'Erythromycin' is usally prescribed as the single word, the particular salt is not relevant to its spectrum of antibiotic activity and only rarely is it necessary to distinguish the 'stearate' from the 'ethyl succinate' forms. The correct (at least in the UK) pharmacy ; medical term to use is Clavulanic acid, similary the amoxicillin used in Co-amoxiclav is prescribed just as 'Amoxicillin', yet in oral form the trihydrate is used and that for injection uses the sodium salt. To quote from the BNF, which sets out the use of terms::''"'''Co-amoxiclav''' A mixture of amoxicillin (as the trihydrate or as the sodium salt) and clavulanic acid (as potassium clavulanate)..."''*I'll therefore revert back, but add the details of the forms used to Amoxicillin, Co-amoxiclav, Clavulanic acid and Potassium Clavulanate (which incidentally is wrong in its specification of only being mixed with the trihydrate form of Amoxicillin)David Ruben  Talk  00:13, 17 February 2006 (UTC)Side EffectsSome side affects may include nose bleeds.:—The preceding unsigned comment was added by 207.255.143.130 (talk • Special:Contributions/207.255.143.130|contribs).;;; 23:07, 18 October 2006Yeast infections are common in women who take any kind of antibiotic.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Citysmile (talk • Special:Contributions/Citysmile|contribs) 20:07, 16 January 2008 (UTC);;; ;;Does anyone know if any work has been done around whether the Side-Effects of Amoxi' are from the Amoxicillin itself, or the colourants used in the Capsule shell?

Also, if you are allergic to Amoxicillin, does it mean that you are allergic to Penicillin, as they are related? User:219.89.32.163 08:06, 21 November 2006:Allergic reaction to Amoxicillin is no different in its symptoms or mechanism from any other drug allergy, so does not need to be repeated in each drug article. See allergy and Anaphylaxis.:Generally allergies are shared amongst related chemical structures, so yes allergy to Amoxicillin should be taken to imply allergy to all penicillins. Of course this supposes that someone reporting an allergy really has had an allergic reaction to the drug - the rash could have been from the disease itself (i.e. is a rash that develops with a sore throat promptly treated with a penicillin from the drug, or was the rash about to appear anyway as part of the disease i.e. scarlet fever). Also the reaction might have been to one of the other constituent of the medication (e.g. the colouring rather than the active Amoxicillin itself). The problem with such supposition is that it may lead one to suppose that a further "trial" exposure would help settle the scientific reproducibility test for "proof" - however whilst one exposure to the penicillin may have merely resulted in an allergic rash, subsequent exposure might rarely result in life threatening anaphylactic shock - so re-exposure testing is not worth it.:Many people report allergic reactions when what they mean is that they experienced an intolerance or a side effect, these are not the same as an immune-mediated reaction. Hence tummy upset,  diarrhoea or nausea with a drug is not an allergic reaction (but reasonable reasons to try to choose an alternative drug in the future).:I have always been told that in the UK, only about 10% of people who report having an apparent allergic reaction in childhood to a penicillin are likely to really have had one. This may have to do with previous fairly indiscriminate use of antibiotics for what would now be felt to be viral illness (many of which cause a mild rash to appear) that do not warrant any treatment and the rash was not caused by the antibiotic given, or some fairly sloppy labelling (by doctors as well as patients) of any side effect/intolerance as an allergy.:If the evidence to support a possible penicillin allergy in childhood is not good (especially of course if no old past notes available) then cephalosporin group are reasonable choice. There is only a 10% cross-over sensitivity between those who have a penicillin allergy to this group, and given that only perhaps 10% of people who have a claim of penicillin allergy (without firm evidence or personal recall of events) really have such an allergy, likelihood or reaction to cephalosporin around 1% in such cases. Cephalosporins have nearly the same bacterial coverage as penicillins (especially for streptococcus, but less so for staphylococcus), otherwise use of macrolide antibiotics, but these have generally higher incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. David Ruben  Talk  14:53, 21 November 2006 (UTC)::A further complication to add to David's excellent response is that there is a distinction between an immune-system response and a "true allergic" reaction, which is IgE-mediated.  I think I'm going to add to this article specifically about "ampicillin rash" (late-developing, non-allergic), because it appears to be quite common and I have a couple good references to cite.  See, e.g.:PMID 15805383 --Skoch3 (talk) 04:53, 18 February 2008 (UTC)Anaphylaxis:I nearly died recently from anaphylactic shock triggered by Amoxil.  In my case the reaction was full-blown -- protruding tongue rendering it impossible to speak); extensive rash on arms and body; maddeningly itchy hands and feet; swollen lips, feet and hands;  dangerously low blood pressure; and shallow breathing -- in only 20 minutes after exposure.:For obvious reasons, I think it a bad policy to relegate allergies to medications to a general article.  This is such a dangerous and potentially fatal reaction that it should be given more prominence and urgency.
