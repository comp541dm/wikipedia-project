The '''Atari ST''' is a line of home computers from Atari Corporation and the successor to the Atari 8-bit family. The first ST model, the 520ST, was released in June 1985. "ST" officially stands for "Sixteen/Thirty-two", which referred to the Motorola 68000's 16-bit external bus and 32-bit internals. The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bit-mapped color GUI, using a version of Digital Research's GEM released in February 1985.. Groups.google.com (1985-03-11).

The 1040ST, released in 1986, is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than US$1."byte198603"The Atari ST is part of the 16/32-bit generation of home computers, based on the Motorola 68000 CPU, typically with 512KB or more of RAM, a graphical user interface, and 3Â½-inch floppy disks as storage.  The ST was primarily a competitor to the Macintosh, Amiga, and, in certain markets, the Acorn Archimedes. Whereas the Amiga has custom graphics processors and sample-based synthesis audio, the ST has a basic frame buffer and a three-voice synthesizer chip but with a slightly faster CPU and a high-resolution monochrome display mode ideal for business and CAD. Its simple design allowed the ST to precede the Commodore Amiga's commercial release by almost two months.In some markets, particularly Germany, the machine gained a strong foothold as a small business machine for CAD and Desktop publishing work.Thanks to its built-in MIDI, the ST enjoyed success for running music-sequencer software and as a controller of musical instruments among both amateurs and well-known musicians.The ST was later superseded by the Atari STE, Atari TT, Atari MEGA STE, and Falcon computers.OriginsThe Atari ST was born from the rivalry between home-computer makers Atari, Inc. and Commodore International.Amiga contractJay Miner, one of the original designers for the custom chips found in the Atari 2600 and Atari 8-bit family, tried to convince Atari management to create a new chipset for a video game console and computer. When his idea was rejected, Miner left Atari to form a small think tank called Hi-Toro in 1982 and began designing the new "Lorraine" chipset. The company, which was later renamed Amiga Corporation, was pretending to sell video game controllers to deceive competition while it developed a Lorraine-based computer."History of Amiga video" (2008-02-18). Retrieved on 2013-04-22.Amiga ran out of capital to complete Lorraine's development, and Atari, owned by Warner Communications, paid Amiga to continue development work. In return Atari received exclusive use of the Lorraine design for one year as a video game console. After one year Atari would have the right to add a keyboard and market the complete computer, designated the 1850XLD. As Atari was heavily involved with Disney at the time, it was later code-named "Mickey", and the 256K memory expansion board was codenamed "Minnie".["Confidential Atari-Amiga Agreement" and "Afterthoughts: The Atari 1600XL Rumor"].

The company initially considered the National Semiconductor NS320xx microprocessor but was disappointed with its performance.3yearschin19850128 This started the move to the 68000.Tramiel learned that Warner wanted to sell Atari, which in mid-1984 was losing about a million dollars per day. Interested in Atari's overseas manufacturing and worldwide distribution network for his new computer, Tramiel negotiated with Warner in May and June 1984. He secured funding and bought Atari's Consumer Division (which included the console and home computer departments) in July. As executives and engineers left Commodore to join Tramiel's new Atari Corporation, Commodore responded by filing lawsuits against four former engineers for theft of trade secrets.The Tramiels did not purchase the employee contracts when they bought the assets of Atari Inc., so one of their first acts was to interview Atari Inc. employees to decide whom to hire at what was essentially a brand new company. This company was originally called TTL (Tramiel Technologies Limited), later renamed to Atari Corp.  At the time of the purchase of Atari Inc's assets, there were roughly 900 employees remaining from a high point of 10,000. After the interviews, approximately 100 employees were hired to work at Atari Corp.At one point a custom sound processor called AMY was a planned component for the new ST computer design, but the chip needed more time to complete, so AMY was dropped in favor of an off the shelf Yamaha sound chip.It was during this time in late July/early August that Leonard Tramiel discovered the original Amiga contract, which required Amiga Corporation to deliver the Lorraine chipset to Atari on June 30, 1984. Amiga Corp. had sought more monetary support from investors in spring 1984 (among them Tramel;; Technology, which wished to replace nearly everyone at Amiga).Commodore and AmigaHaving heard rumors that Tramiel was negotiating to buy Atari, Amiga Corp. entered into discussions with Commodore. The discussions led to Commodore wanting to purchase Amiga Corporation outright, which Commodore believed would cancel any outstanding contracts, including Atari's. Instead of Amiga Corp. delivering Lorraine to Atari, Commodore delivered a check of $500,000 to Atari on Amiga's behalf, in effect returning the funds Atari invested into Amiga for the chipset. Tramiel countersued Amiga Corp. on August 13, 1984. He sought damages and an injunction to bar Amiga (and effectively Commodore) from producing anything with its technology.At Commodore, the Amiga team was in limbo during the summer of 1984 because of the lawsuit. No word on the status of the chipset, the Lorraine computer, or the team's fate was known. In the fall of 1984, Commodore informed the team that the Lorraine project was active again, the chipset was to be improved, the operating system (OS) developed, and the hardware design completed. While Commodore announced the Amiga 1000 with the Lorraine chipset in July 1985, the delay gave Atari, with its many former Commodore engineers, time to deliver the first Atari ST units in June 1985. In March 1987, the two companies settled the dispute out of court in a closed decision.. Heartbone.com. Retrieved on 2013-04-22.Operating systemWith the hardware design nearing completion, the Atari team started looking at solutions for the operating system (OS). Soon after the Atari buyout, Microsoft approached Tramiel with the suggestion that they port Windows to the platform, but the delivery date was out by about two years, far too long for their needs. Another possibility was Digital Research, who was working on a new GUI-based system then known as Crystal, soon to become GEM. Another option was to write a new operating system in-house, but this was rejected as Atari management was unsure whether the company had the required expertise to do so."3years"Digital Research was fully committed to the Intel platform, so a team from Atari was sent to the Digital Research headquarters to work with the "Monterey Team" which comprised a mixture of Atari and Digital Research engineers. Atari's Leonard Tramiel was the Atari person overseeing "Project Jason" (a.k.a.The Operating System) for the Atari ST line of computers. The name came from the original designer and developer, Jason Loveman. Tim Oren has [an article] describing the history of the project, from his series "Professional GEM".GEM was initially based on CP/M-68K, essentially a direct port of CP/M to the 68000. By 1985, CP/M was becoming increasingly outdated; it did not support sub-directories, for example. Digital Research was also in the process of building a new DOS-like operating system specifically for GEM, ''GEMDOS'', and there was some discussion of whether or not a port of GEMDOS could be completed in time for product delivery in June. The decision was eventually taken to port it, resulting in a GEMDOS file system which became part of TOS (''The Operating System'' and colloquially known as the ''Tramiel Operating System''). This was beneficial as it gave the ST a fast, hierarchical file system, essential for hard drive storage disks, plus programmers had function calls similar to the IBM PC DOS.Besides the original TOS operating system, a number of third party OSes were developed or ported to the Atari ST. Among Unix Clones, Idris, Minix had an Atari ST port and the Mint OS was developed specifically for the Atari ST.Debut and releaseAfter six months of intensive effort following Tramiel's takeover, Atari announced the 520ST at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January 1985."3years"''InfoWorld'' described prototypes shown at computer shows as a "typical Commodore-64 style, corner-cutting, low-cost Jack Tramiel product", but Atari unexpectedly displayed the ST at COMDEX in May. Due to its similarities to the original Apple Macintosh and Tramiel's role in its development, it was quickly nicknamed the "Jackintosh". Atari's rapid development of the ST amazed many,"3years"chin19850128 but others were more skeptical, citing the ST's "cheap" appearance, Atari's uncertain financial health, and the poor relations the Tramiel-led Commodore had with software developers.chin19850128chinsoft19850128sanger19850513As early as 1981, Adam Osborne wrote that while Tramiel "deserves credit for what he has been able to accomplish", "the microcomputer industry abounds with horror stories describing the way Commodore treats its dealers and its customers." In 1984 ''Ahoy!'' had written, before he purchased Atari, that Tramiel "had never been able to establish very good relations with computer dealers ... Under his reign, computer retailers have accused Commodore of treating them as harshly as if they were suppliers or competitors". ''Computer Gaming World'' stated that his poor reputation likely made computer stores reluctant to deal with Atari, hurting the company's distribution of the ST. One retailer said, "If you can believe Lucy when she holds the football for Charlie Brown, you can believe Jack Tramiel", and another said that because of its experience with Tramiel "Our interest in Atari is zero, zilch". Observers criticized the company's erratic discussion of its stated plans for the new computer, quickly shifting from using mass merchandisers to specialty computer stores to both; Atari executives could not name any computer stores that would carry the ST when asked at COMDEX. One analyst stated after attending a meeting with the company, "We've seen marketing strategies changed before our eyes".sanger19850513Tramiel's poor reputation also influenced potential developers of software for the Atari ST, with one stating that "Dealing with Commodore was like dealing with Attila the Hun. I don't know if Tramiel will be following his old habits ... I don't see a lot of people rushing to get software on the machine."chin19850128 The majority of software companies were hesitant to support another platform beyond the IBM PC, Apple, and Commodore 64; "These days, if I were a consumer, I'd stick to companies [Apple and IBM] I know will be around", said Philippe Kahn of Borland. ''The New York Times'' reported after COMDEX that "more than 100 software titles will be available for the machine, most written by small software houses that desperately need work".sanger19850513Trip Hawkins of Electronic Arts said "I don't think Atari understands the software business. I'm still skeptical about its resources and its credibility." Although Michael Berlyn of Infocom promised that his company would quickly publish all of its games for the new computer, he doubted that many others would soon do so. Other companies such as Spinnaker Software and Lifetree Software were more positive. Both promised to soon release ST software, with the former reporting that "Atari has a vastly improved attitude toward software developers. They are eager to give us technical support and machines", and the latter stating "we are giving Atari high priority". Some, such as Software Publishing Corporation, were unsure of whether to develop for the ST or the Amiga, while John C. Dvorak wrote that the public saw both Commodore and Atari as selling "cheap disposable" game machines.SuccessAtari ST advertisements stated "America, We Built It For You", and quoted Atari president Sam Tramiel: "We promised. We delivered. With pride, determination, and good old ATARI know how". Although Atari was out of cash, sales of its 8-bit computers were "very, very slow" according to Jack Tramiel, and employees feared that he would shut the company down. The 520ST shipped during spring 1985 to the press, developers, and user groups, and in early July 1985 for general retail sales, saving the company."3years"maremaa19850603 By November the company stated that it had sold more than 50,000 520 STs, "with U.S. sales alone well into five figures". The machine had gone from concept to store shelves in a little under a year. Atari had originally intended to release versions with 128KB and 256KB of RAM as the ''130ST'' and ''260ST'' respectively. However, with the OS loaded from floppy into RAM, there would be little or no room left over for applications to run. The 260ST did make its way into Europe on a limited basis.The ST supports a monochrome or color monitor. The color hardware supports two different resolutions, 320 Ã 200 with 16 out of 512 colors, or 640 Ã 200 with 4 out of 512 colors. The monochrome monitor was less expensive and has a single resolution of 640 Ã 400. Due to its higher vertical resolution and noninterlaced operation at 70Hz, the monochrome monitor was better suited to business applications. The attached monitor determines available resolutions, so software either supports both types of monitors or only works with one. Color is required by a majority of games. Unlike the Amiga, Commodore 64, and Atari 8-bit computers, the ST does not have hardware-supported sprites.The early ST systems have no battery-backed clock so time needs to be set after turning on. Early models shipped with Atari Logo and ''TOS'' on disk; although the operating system occupies 206K RAM, but models were designed with four ROM sockets allow easy upgrading to the future ROM-based ''TOS''.byte198601 These became available only a few months later and were included in all new machines as well as being available to upgrade older machines. By late 1985 the machines were also upgraded with the addition of an RF modulator (for TV display), a version known as the 520STM.Atari had originally intended to include GEM's GDOS (Graphical Device Operating System), which allowed programs to send GEM VDI (Virtual Device Interface) commands to drivers loaded by GDOS. This allowed developers to send VDI instructions to other devices simply by pointing to it. However, GDOS was not ready at the time the ST started shipping and was included in software packages and later ST machines. Later versions of GDOS supported vector fonts.The face of J.R. "Bob" DobbsA limited set of GEM fonts were also included within the ROMs. These fonts also feature a standard 8x8 pixel graphical character set for the ST (the main in-ROM "font" for GEM and text-mode TOS operations in color modes) containing standard numbers, letters, symbols, accented characters, and four unusual characters (which can be placed together in a square, forming a basic but recognizable facsimile of the face of J. R. "Bob" Dobbs, the figurehead of the Church of the Subgenius).Robert Anton Wilson, ["Religion For the Hell of It"], ''Hot Press'', 1986The ST was less expensive than most machines, including the Macintosh Plus, and tended to be faster than most. Largely as a result of the price/performance factor, the ST would go on to be a fairly popular machine, notably in European markets where the foreign-exchange rates amplified prices. Indeed, the company's English advertising strapline of the era was "power without the price". In fact, an Atari ST and terminal emulation software was much cheaper than a Digital VT220 terminal, which was commonly needed by offices with central computers.DesignOriginal housingThe Atari 520STThe original 520ST case design was created by Ira Velinsky Atari's chief Industrial Designer. The ST is basically wedge shaped, featuring bold angular lines and a series of grilles cut into the rear for airflow. The keyboard has soft tactile feedback and rhomboid-shaped function keys across the top. The 520ST is an all-in-one unit, similar to earlier home computers like the Commodore 64. By the time the 520ST reached the market, however, market and IBM compatibility concerns demanded a keyboard with cursor keys and a numeric keypad. For this reason, the 520ST ended up significantly larger than previous popular all-in-one machines like the Commodore 64.The 520ST uses an external "brick" power supply, floppy disk, monitor, and mouse. Even basic system setups thus suffer from cable spaghetti, a problem future versions would address to one degree or another. Early 520ST owners became accustomed to the "Atari Twist" and the "Atari Drop" service procedures. The "Atari Twist" seemed to help discharge built-up static electricity (Atari soldered-down the metal shielding to fix the problem) while the "Atari Drop" appeared to help re-seat chips which may have become partially unseated over time.Port connectionsAtari 520ST portsAtari ST mouse (2000)The 520ST features a large number of ports mounted at the rear of the machine. The basic port layout would remain largely unchanged over the machine's history.* Standard ports:** RS-232c serial port (DB25 male, operating as basic 9-conductor DTE)** Centronics printer port (DB25 female, officially compliant only with the most basic unidirectional standard with a single, "Busy" input line; unofficially offering some bidirectional capabilities)** joystick/mouse ports (DE-9 male, Atari VCS standard)** 2 MIDI ports (5-pin DIN, "IN" and "OUT/THRU")* ST-specific ports:** Monitor port (custom 13-pin DIN, 12 of the pins in a rectangular pattern, carrying signals for both RGB and monochrome monitors, monophonic audio and, in later models, composite video)** ACSI (similar to SCSI) DMA port (custom-sized 19-pin D-sub, for hard disks and laser printers, capable of up to 2MByte/s with efficient programming)** Floppy port (standard if rare 14-pin DIN, listed as operating at 250 kbit/s)** ST cartridge port (double-sided 40-contact edge connector socket, for 128KB ROM cartridges)Because of its bi-directional design, the Centronics printer port can be used for joystick input, and several games make use of available adaptors that plugged into the printer socket, providing two additional 9-pin joystick ports.Floppy driveAtari initially used single-sided disk drives that could store up to 360kB.;; Later drives were double-sided and stored 720kB. Some commercial software, particularly games, shipped by default on single-sided disks, even supplying two 360kB floppies instead of a single double-sided one, for fear of alienating early adopters. The problem was exacerbated by the early drive's single read/write head being on the "wrong" side of the disc that is, reading/writing the same side of the disc as a more standard 720kB drive's "second" head ("head 1") instead of its "first" ("head 0"). The boot sector and FAT was typically written to "side 0" by double-sided drives (in both STs and other marques fitted with 3.5" drives), so owners of single-sided machines could not read any useful data from a standard double-sided disc at all, not even the root directory listing, and might well mistakenly end up reformatting just one side of a seemingly "faulty" disc as a result.ST magazines wishing to cater to the entire audience while still supplying a large amount of material on a single cover disc had to adopt innovative custom formats to work around this problem, forcing the bootsector and FAT onto "side 1", along with the disc's main feature program, and tucking supplemental programs onto "side 0" (typically falsely renamed "side B", in allusion to classic 45rpm singles), "inside" a particular file folder which would only open successfully for owners of 720kB drives. Owners of single-sided drives were encouraged, if they wished to gain access to "side B", to send the original coverdisk(s) back to the publisher with a token fee for postage and duplication, for which they would be sent a set of single-sided discs containing the full software complement. This scheme was also operated by some producers of productivity software in later years, mirroring the PC situation where software would ship by default on a particular disc format (3.5" or 5.25", double or high density) and a customer who bought the wrong type could have it replaced by mail order.Another early sticking point with the ST's floppy drives was that, whilst double-sided drive equipped STs could happily read discs formatted under MS-DOS on IBM PCs, PCs could not themselves read Atari disks, because the initial versions of TOS could recognise, read, and write to but not themselves create discs in the same particular specification used and indeed demanded by MS-DOS (single-sided Atari drives were completely incompatible in either direction, as MS-DOS never officially supported single-sided 3.5" hardware, and still placed its filesystem information on "side 0"). Achieving successful data interchange between the two platforms using floppies thus required pre-formatting dedicated file transfer discs under MS-DOS, and copying the necessary data onto them from any unsuitable Atari formatted discs. This formatting issue was soon resolved by the emergence of third-party formatting and file copier software, MS-DOS disc imaging software capable of reading the unusual formats used by the ST and various other machines (such as the Commodore Amiga) and, a few years later, Atari's own version 1.4 (and later) TOS upgrades.STF and STFM modelsFile:Atari ST 1040.jpg|thumb|Atari 1040STFAtari later upgraded the basic design in 1986 with the ''1040STF'' (also written ''STF''). The machine is generally similar to the earlier 520ST, but moved the power supply and a double-sided floppy drive into the rear of the housing of the computer, as opposed to being external. This added to the size of the machine, but reduced cable clutter in the back. However, the joystick/mouse ports, formerly on the right side of the machine where the disk now sat, had to be moved to an awkward location in a cramped niche underneath the keyboard.The ''1040ST'' was the first personal computer shipped with a base RAM configuration of 1MB. When the list price was reduced to $999 in the U.S. it appeared on the cover of ''BYTE'' in March 1986 as the first computer to break the $1000/megabyte price barrier;"3years"''Compute!'' noted that, in fact, the ''1040ST'' was the first computer to break the $2500/megabyte price barrier. However, the ST remained generally the same internally over the majority of its several-year lifespan. The choice of model numbers was inherited from the model numbers of the ''XE series'' of the Atari 8-bit family of computers.  A limited number of 1040STFs shipped with a single-sided floppy drive.The same basic design was also used for a cut-down version, the 512 kB ''520STFM'', which replaced the earlier 520ST models in the market. The early 'STF' machines lack the 'M' modulator that allows a TV to be used and will only work with a monitor.Mega modelsInitial sales were strong, especially in Europe where Atari sold 75% of its computers. Germany became Atari's strongest market,"3years"with small business users using them for desktop publishing and CAD.To address this growing market segment, Atari came up with the ''ST1''. Debuted at Comdex in 1986, it was received favorably. Renamed the ''Mega'', this new machine includes a high-quality detached keyboard, a stronger case to support the weight of a monitor, and an internal bus expansion connector. A 20 MB hard drive called the SH204 could be purchased as an option and stacked below or above the main case of the Mega.  The upcoming SLM804 laser printer would not come with a processor or memory, reducing costs. It would attach to the Mega through the ST DMA port and require the Mega computer to render the pages. As TOS was not a multitasking OS, this meant the computer could not be used while printing. Initially equipped with 2 or 4 MB (a 1 MB version, the ''Mega 1'' would later follow), the Mega machines would complement the Atari laser printer for a low-cost desktop publishing package, which received acclaim and was featured on the cover of Computer Shopper magazine.A custom blitter co-processor was to be included to speed the performance of some graphics operations on the screen, but due to delays it was eventually released on the ''Mega 2'' and ''Mega 4'' machines. Developers wanting to use it had to detect for it in their programs because it was not present on all machines. However, properly written programs using the screen VDI commands can use the blitter seamlessly, since GEM API is a higher-level interface to ''TOS''.Later modelsSTE modelsIn late 1989, Atari released the ''520STE'' and ''1040STE'' (also written ''STE''), enhanced version of the ST with improvements to the multimedia hardware and operating system. It features an increased color palette of 4096 colors from the ST's 512 (though the maximum displayable palette of these without programming tricks was still limited to 16 in the lowest 320x200 resolution, and even fewer in higher resolutions), Genlock support, and a graphics co-processor chip called Blitter, which can quickly move large blocks of data (most particularly, graphics sprites) around in RAM. It also included a new 2-channel digital sound chip that could play 8-bit stereo samples in hardware at up to 50kHz. Two enhanced joystick ports (EJP) were added (two normal joysticks can be plugged into each port with an adapter), with the new connectors placed in more easily accessed locations on the side of the case. The enhanced joystick ports were re-used in Atari's Jaguar console, and are compatible. RAM was now much more simply upgradable via SIMMs. CPU speed was unchanged and ran at 8MHz.The STE models initially had software and hardware conflicts resulting in some applications and video games written for the ST line being unstable or even completely unusable, primarily caused by programming direct hardware calls which bypassed the operating system. Sometimes incompatibility could be solved by expanding the RAM. Furthermore, even having a joystick plugged in would sometimes cause strange behavior with a few applications (such as the WYSIWYG word-processor application 1st Word/1st Word Plus|First Word Plus).The STE was the first Atari with PCM audio, which was probably one of the most attractive features of the machine. It has the ability to play back 8-bit (signed) samples using the SDMA at the following frequencies: 6258Hz, 12517Hz, 25033Hz and even 50066Hz a sampling frequency above that of audio CDs, although at only 8-bit resolution. The channels are arranged as either a mono track or a track of LRLRLRLR... bytes.Very little use was made of the extra features of the STE: STE-enhanced and STE-only software were rare, generally being limited to serious art, CAD, or music applications, with very few games taking advantage of the hardware, not present on most machines.The last STE machine, the ''Mega STE'', is an STE in a grey Atari TT case that had a switchable 16MHz, dual-bus design (16-bit external, 32-bit internal), optional Motorola 68881 FPU, built-in 3Â½-inch floppy disk drive, VME expansion slot, a network port (very similar to that used by Apple's LocalTalk) and an optional built-in 3Â½" hard drive. It also shipped with TOS 2.00 (better support for hard drives, enhanced desktop interface, memory test, 1.44MB floppy support, bug fixes). It was marketed as more affordable than a TT but more powerful than an ordinary ST.Atari TTAtari TT030In 1990, Atari released the high-end workstation-oriented ''Atari TT030'', based on a 32MHz Motorola 68030 processor. The "TT" name ("Thirty-two/Thirty-two") continued the nomenclature system as the 68030 chip had full 32-bit wide buses both internally and externally. Originally planned with a 68020 CPU, the TT included improved graphics and more powerful support chips. The case was a new design with an integrated hard-drive enclosure.Atari FalconAtari FalconThe final ST computer is the multimedia-capable ''Atari Falcon030''. Like the TT, this was also 68030-based, operating at 16MHz, but with improved video modes and an on-board Motorola 56001 audio digital signal processor. The Falcon, like the Atari STE, supports sampling frequencies above 44.1kHz; the sampling master clock is 98340Hz, which can be divided by a number between 2 and 16 to get the actual sampling frequencies. Apart from these frequencies, it is also able to play the STE sample frequencies (up to 50066Hz) in 8 or 16 bit, mono/stereo, all by using the same DMA interface as the STE, with a few additions. The Falcon can both play back and record samples; it has 8 mono channels / 4 stereo channels; thus this allowed musicians to use the computer for harddisk recording. Although the 68030 microprocessor is capable of using 32-bit memory, the Falcon uses a 16-bit bus which affects performance, but also served to reduce its cost. In another cost-reduction measure, Atari shipped the Falcon in an inexpensive case much like that of the STF and STE. Aftermarket upgrade kits were available that allowed the Falcon to be put in a desktop or rack-mount case, with the keyboard separate.Released in 1992, the Falcon was discontinued by Atari the following year. In Europe, C-Lab licensed the Falcon design from Atari, and released the C-Lab Falcon Mk I (the same as Atari's Falcon except for some slight modifications to the audio circuitry), Mk II (as Mk I but with an internal 500 MB SCSI hard disk) and Mk X (as Mk II but in a desktop case).AftermathIn 1993, Atari ceased development on the ST computers to focus on the Jaguar.Following the exit of Atari from the computer market, Medusa Computer Systems manufactured some powerful 3rd-party Atari Falcon/TT-compatible machines that used 68040 and 68060 processors, based on multimedia (particularly audio, but also video), CAD, and office uses.Despite the lack of a hardware supplier, there is a small active community dedicated to keeping the ST platform alive. There have been advancements in the operating system, software emulators (for Windows, Mac, ; Linux), and some hardware developments. There are accelerator cards, such as the CT60 ; CT63, which is a 68060 based accelerator card for the Falcon, and there is the Atari Coldfire Project, which aims at developing an Atari-clone based on the Coldfire processor. Milan Computer of Germany also made 68040 and 68060-based Atari clones that can run either Atari TOS 4.5 or Milan Computer's MultiTOS operating system.SoftwareAs with the Atari 8-bit computers,leyenberger198806 software publishers attributed their reluctance to produce Atari ST products in part to;mdash;as ''Compute!'' reported in 1988;mdash;the belief in the existence of a "higher-than-normal amount of software piracy". That year WordPerfect threatened to discontinue the Atari ST version of its word processor because the company discovered that pirate bulletin board systems (BBSs) were distributing it, causing ''ST-Log'' to warn that "we had better put a stop to piracy ''now'' ... it can have harmful effects on the longevity and health of your computer". In 1989 magazines published a letter by Gilman Louie, head of Spectrum Holobyte. He stated that he had been warned by competitors that releasing a game like ''Falcon'' on the ST would fail because BBSs would widely disseminate it. Within 30 days of releasing the non-copy protected ST version, the game was available on BBSs with maps and code wheels. Because the ST market was smaller than that for the IBM PC it was more vulnerable to piracy which, Louie said, seemed to be better organized and more widely accepted for the ST. He reported that the Amiga version sold in six weeks twice as much as the ST version in nine weeks, and that the Mac and PC versions had four times the sales. ''Computer Gaming World'' stated "This is certainly the clearest exposition ... we have seen to date" of why software companies produced less software for the ST than for other computers.Music and soundThe ST has built-in MIDI ports, and there was plenty of MIDI-related software for use professionally in music studios, or by amateur enthusiasts. The popular Windows/Macintosh applications ''Cubase'' and ''Logic Pro'' originated on the Atari ST (the latter as ''Notator Logic'', preceded by ''Creator'', ''Notator'' and ''Notator-SL''). Another popular and powerful ST music sequencer application, Dr. T's ''KCS'', contains a "Multi-Program Environment" that allows ST users to run other applications, such as the synthesizer patch editing software XoR (now known as Unisyn on the Macintosh), from within the sequencer application..

The Microdeal Replay Professional product features a sound sampler that cleverly uses the ST cartridge port to read in parallel from the cartridge port from the ADC. For output of digital sound, it uses the on-board frequency output, sets it to 128kHz (inaudible) and then modulates the amplitude of that.Another program that had good success on the ST platform is ''MasterTracks Pro'' from Passport Designs, of Half Moon Bay, CA., that was first put out by Don Williams for the Macintosh. When the ST died, a PC version continued that one could port MIDI to using the generic .MID format. GVox bought out Passport, and continues the program for Windows and Mac OS along with the other Passport product, the notation program ''Encore''.In addition to the sound-sampling functionalities, the availability of software packages with MIDI support for music composition and efficient sound analysis contributed to make the Atari ST a forerunner of later computer-based all-in-one studios.The ST's low cost, built-in MIDI ports, and fast, low-latency response times made it a favorite with musicians:* Atari Teenage Riot named itself after the brand and programmed most of their music on an Atari ST. Including the entire album ''Is This Hyperreal?'' (June, 2011).* The Fatboy Slim album ''You've Come A Long Way, Baby'' has an Atari ST in the large foldout picture of Fatboy Slim's studio.* Electronic music artists Mike Paradinas and Luke Vibert started out writing music on Atari STs.* The album notes for Mike Oldfield's ''Earth Moving'' state that it was recorded using an Atari ST and C-Lab MIDI software.* In the Paris performance of Jean Michel Jarre's album ''Waiting for Cousteau'', musicians have attached Atari ST machines with unidentified MIDI software to their keyboards, as could be seen in the TV live show and video recordings.* White Town's "Your Woman", which reached #1 in the UK singles charts, was created using an Atari ST.[White Town â Your Questions Answered!].

It does not feature the Atari ST's GEM graphical user interface but, instead, features an application specific graphical user interface and widget framework which he developed using, in part, the Neochrome paint program.Software developmentThe Atari ST has a wide variety of languages and tools for development. 68000 assemblers (MadMac from Atari Corp, HiSoft Systems's Devpac, TurboAss, GFA-Assembler), Pascal (OSS Personal Pascal, Maxon Pascal, PurePascal), Modula-2, C compilers (like Turbo C, Alcyon C, Lattice C, Megamax C, Mark Williams C, GNU C, Aztec C, AHCC (A Home Cooked C)), LISP, Prolog, Logo, and many others.The initial development kit from Atari included a computer and manuals. At $5,000, this discouraged many from developing software for the ST. Later, the Atari Developer's Kit consisted of software and manuals (no hardware) for $300. Included with the kit were a resource kit, C compiler (first Alcyon C, then Mark Williams C), debugger, and 68000 assembler (plus the non-disclosure agreement).The ST came bundled with a system disk that contained ''ST BASIC'', the first BASIC for the ST. However, due to its poor performance, users favored other BASICs, such as HiSoft BASIC, ''GFA BASIC'', FaST BASIC (notable for being one of the few programs to actually be supplied as a ROM cartridge instead of on disc), and the relatively famous ''STOS'', which then inspired and led to the creation of AMOS on the Amiga, and powerful enough that it was used (with a compiler, opposed to its usual runtime interpreter) for the production of at least two commercial titles and an innumerable host of good quality shareware and public domain games. In the late years of the Atari ST Omikron Basic was bundled with it in Germany.Even novelty tools such as ''SEUCK'' were available.GamesThe ST enjoyed success in gaming due to low cost, fast performance and colorful graphics.Notable individuals who developed games on the ST include Peter Molyneux, Doug Bell, Jeff Minter, Ãric Chahi, Jez San, and David Braben. An early real-time 3D role-playing video game, ''Dungeon Master'', was first developed and released on the ST, and was the best-selling software ever produced for the platform. Simulation games like ''Falcon'' and ''Flight Simulator II'' made use of the enhanced graphics found in the ST machines, as did many arcade ports. One game, MIDI Maze, uses the MIDI ports to connect up to 16 machines for interactive networked play. Games simultaneously released on the Amiga that had identical graphics and sound were often accused by video game magazines of simply being ST ports. The critically acclaimed game ''Another World'' was originally released for ST and Amiga in 1991 with the Polygonal engine developed on the ST and the rotoscoped animations created on the Amiga (the two games are very similar on both systems).Garry Kasparov became the first player to register the commercial ''ChessBase'', a popular commercial database program produced for storing and searching records of games of chess. The first version was built for Atari ST with his collaboration in January 1987. In his autobiography ''Child of Change'', he regards this facility as ''the most important development in chess research since printing''.Category:Atari ST gamesUtilitiesUtility software was available to drive hardware add-ons such as video digitisers. Office Productivity and graphics software was also bundled with the ST (HyperPaint II by Dimitri Koveos, HyperDraw by David Farmborough, 3D-Calc spreadsheet by Frank Schoonjans, and several others commissioned by Bob Katz, later of Electronic Arts).There was a thriving output of public domain and shareware software which was distributed by, in the days long before public internet access, public domain software libraries that advertised in magazines and on popular dial-up bulletin board systems.Remarkably, a modest core fanbase for the system, supporting a dwindling number of good quality print magazines, survived to the mid-'90s and the birth of the modern, publicly accessible Internet as we know it. Despite the limited graphics, memory, and temporary hard-storage capabilities of the system, several email, FTP, telnet, IRC, and even full-blown graphical World Wide Web browser applications were available and usable on the ST.There were also DOS emulators released in the late 1980s. ''PC-Ditto'' came in two versions, software-only-, and a hardware version that plugs into the cartridge slot or kludges internally. After running the PC-Ditto software, a DOS boot disk is required to load the system. Both allow users to run DOS programs in CGA mode, though much more slowly than on an IBM PC. Other options are the ''PC-Speed'' (NEC V30), ''AT-Speed'' (Intel 80286) and ''ATonce-386SX'' (Intel 80386sx) hardware emulator boards.Technical specificationsAll STs are made up of both custom and commercial chips:* Custom chips:** ''ST Shifter'' ''"Video shift register chip"'' Enables bitmap graphics using 32KB of contiguous memory for all resolutions. Screen address has to be a multiple of 256.** ''ST GLU'' ''"Generalized Logic Unit"'' Control logic for the system used to connect the ST's chips. Not part of the data path, but needed to bridge chips with each other.** ''ST MMU'' ''"Memory Management Unit"'' Provides signals needed for CPU/blitter/DMA and Shifter to access dynamic RAM. Even memory accesses are given to CPU/blitter/DMA while odd cycles are reserved for DRAM refresh or used by Shifter for displaying contents of the frame buffer.** ''ST DMA'' ''"Direct Memory Access"'' Used for floppy and hard drive data transfers. Can directly access main memory in the ST.* Support chips:** ''MC6850P ACIA'' ''"Asynchronous Common Interface Adapter"'' Enables the ST to directly communicate with MIDI devices and keyboard (two chips used).  for MIDI,  for keyboard.** ''MC68901 MFP'' ''"Multi Function Peripheral"'' Used for interrupt generation/control, serial and misc. control input signals. Atari TT030 has two ''MFP'' chips.** ''WD-1772-PH'' ''"Western Digital Floppy Disk Controller"'' Floppy controller chip.** ''YM2149F PSG'' ''"Programmable Sound Generator"'' Provides three--voice sound synthesis, also used for floppy signalling, serial control output and printer parallel port.** ''HD6301V1'' ''"Hitachi keyboard processor"'' Used for keyboard scanning and mouse/joystick ports.ST/STF/STM/STFMAs originally released in the ''520ST'':* CPU: Motorola 68000 16-/32-bit CPU;ref "16/32"; @ 8MHz. 16-bit data/32-bit internal/24-bit address.* RAM: 512KB or 1MB* Display modes (60Hz NTSC, 50Hz PAL, 71.2Hz monochrome):** Low resolution: 320 Ã 200 (16 color), palette of 512 colors** Medium resolution: 640 Ã 200 (4 color), palette of 512 colors** High resolution: 640 Ã 400 (mono), monochrome* Sound: Yamaha YM2149 3-voice squarewave plus 1-voice white noise mono Programmable Sound Generator* Drive: Single-sided 3Â½" floppy disk drive, 360 kB capacity when formatted to standard 9 sector, 80 track layout.* Ports: TV out (on ST-M and ST-FM models, NTSC or PAL standard RF modulated), MIDI in/out (with 'out-thru'), RS-232 serial, Centronics parallel (printer), monitor (RGB or Composite Video color and mono, 13-pin DIN), extra disk drive port (14-pin DIN), DMA port (ACSI port, Atari Computer System Interface) for hard disks and Atari Laser Printer (sharing RAM with computer system), joystick and mouse ports (9-pin MSX standard)* Operating System: TOS v1.00 (TOS meaning The Operating System) with the Graphical Environment Manager (GEM) WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer) GUIVery early machines included the OS on a floppy disk due to it not being ready to be burned to ROM (like the Amiga 1000 had). This early version of TOS was bootstrapped from a very small core boot ROM, but this was quickly replaced with (expanded capacity) ROM versions of TOS 1.0 when it was ready. (This change was also greatly welcomed as older ST machines with memory below 512 kB suffered, as GEM loaded its entire 192 kB code into RAM when booting the desktop). Having the OS loaded from disk was due to Atari trying to rush the machines to market without ironing out all the bugs in the OS. Soon after this change, most production models became STFs, with an integrated single- (520STF/512 kB RAM) or double-sided (1040STF/1024 kB RAM) double density floppy disk drive built-in, but no other changes. The next later models used an upgraded version of TOS: 1.02 (also known as TOS 1.2). Another early addition (after about 6 months) was an RF Modulator that allows the machine to be hooked to a color TV when run in its low or medium resolution (525/625 line 60/50Hz interlace, even on RGB monitors) modes, greatly enhancing the machine's saleability and perceived value (no need to buy a prohibitively expensive, even if exceptionally crisp and clear, monitor). These models were known as the ''520STM'' (or ''520STM''). Later ''F'' and ''FM'' models of the 520 had a built in double-sided disk drive instead of a single-sided one.STEAs originally released in the ''520STE/1040STE'':* All of the features of the 520STFM/1040STFM* Extended palette of 4,096 available colors to choose from* BLiTTER chip for copy/fill/clear large data blocks in memory (max write rate of 4 MB/s)* Hardware-support for horizontal and vertical fine scrolling and split screen (using the Shifter video chip)* DMA sound chip with 2-channels stereo 8-bit PCM sound at 6.25/12.5/25/50kHz and stereo RCA audio-out jacks (using enhancements to the Shifter video chip to support audio shifting)* National LMC 1992 audio controller chip, allowing adjustable left/right/master volume and bass and treble EQ via a "Microwire" (3-bit serial) interface* Memory: 30-pin SIMM memory slots (SIPP packages in earliest versions) allowing upgrades up to 4 MB Allowable memory sizes including only 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 2.5 and 4.0 MB due to configuration restraints (however, 2.5 MB is not officially supported and has compatibility problems).

The early models had only a bootstrap ROM and TOS had to be loaded from disk.; 520ST+: early 520STs with 1MB of RAM, but without floppy disk; 260ST: originally intended to be a 256kB variant, but actually sold in small quantities in Europe with 512KB. Used after the release of the 520ST+ to differentiate the cheaper 512KB models from the 1MB models. Also because the early 520ST's were sold with TOS on disk, this ate up 192KB or RAM so the machine only had around 256K left. So it made sense to call it a 260ST.; 520STM: a 520ST with a built-in modulator for TV output, 512KB RAM.; 520STFM: a 520STM with a newly redesigned motherboard in a larger case with a built-in floppy disk drive (in some cases a single sided drive only), 512KB RAM.; 1040STF: a 520STFM with 1MB of RAM and a built-in double-sided floppy disk, but without RF modulator; 1040STFM: a 520STFM with 1MB of RAM and a built-in double-sided floppy disk with RF modulator; Mega ST (MEGA 1, MEGA 2, MEGA 4): redesigned motherboard with 1, 2 or 4MB of RAM, respectively, in a much improved "pizza box" case with a detached keyboard. All MEGA mainboard have a PLCC socket for the Blitter chip and some early models did not include the BLiTTER chip. Included a real-time clock and internal expansion connector. Some early MEGA 2 had a MEGA 4 mainboard with half of the mem chip places unpopulated and these MEGA 2 can be upgraded by adding the additional DRAM chips and some resistors for the control lines. The MEGA 1 mainboards had a redesigned mem chip area and could not be upgraded in this way as there are only mem chip places for the 1MByte DRAM chips.; 520STE and 1040STE: a 520STFM/1040STFM with enhanced sound, the BLiTTER chip, and a 4096-color palette, in the older 1040 style all-in-one case; Mega STE: same hardware as 1040STE except for a faster 16MHz processor, an onboard SCSI controller, additional faster RS232 port, VME expansion port, in an ST gray version of the TT case; STacy: a portable (but definitely not laptop) version of the ST with the complete ST keyboard, an LCD screen simulating 640x400 hi-res, and a mini-trakball intended mostly for travellers and musicians because of the backlight screen and its built-in midi ports. Originally designed to operate on 12 standard C cell flashlight batteries for portability, when Atari finally realized how quickly the machine would use up a set of batteries (especially when rechargeable batteries of the time supplied insufficient power compared to the intended alkalines), they simply glued the lid of the battery compartment shut.; ST BOOK: a later portable ST, more portable than the STacy, but sacrificing several features in order to achieve this notably the backlight, and internal floppy disk drive. Files were meant to be stored on a small amount (one megabyte) of internal flash memory 'on the road' and transferred using serial or parallel links, memory flashcards or external (and externally powered) floppy disk to a  desktop ST once back indoors. The screen is highly reflective for the time, but still hard to use indoors or in low light, it is fixed to the 640 Ã 400 1-bit mono mode, and no external video port was provided. For its limitations, it gained some popularity, particularly amongst musicians.Unreleased; 130ST: intended to be a 128KB variant. Announced at the 1985 CES alongside the 520ST but never produced.; 4160STE: as 1040STE but with 4MB of RAM. Never officially released except a small quantity of development units. Labels were sent out to dealers to affix to machines that had been upgraded to 4MB.Related systemsAtari ABAQ, or Atari Transputer Workstation: A standalone machine developed in conjunction with Perihelion Hardware, containing modified ST hardware and up to 17 transputers capable of massively parallel operations for tasks such as ray tracing.Clones* GE-Soft Eagle: TT clone but with 32MHz system bus [Article in SOS, June 1995]Peripherals* SF354: Single-sided double-density 3Â½-inch floppy drive (360 kB) with external power supply* SF314: Double-sided double-density 3Â½-inch floppy drive (720 kB) with external power supply* PS3000: Combined 12-inch color monitor and 360k 3Â½-inch floppy drive (SF354).
