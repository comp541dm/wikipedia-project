SEoF (talk) 11:42, 10 May 2010 (UTC)----The reason that a kilobyte is 2^10 is that the same numbers stored in the computerthat the data represents are used to define the addresses where the numbers are,so a 10-bit address bus can address one 2^10th bytes (or a kilobyte).. A 20 bit addressbus can address 2^20th bytes, or megabyte. And so on..  The IBM PC's used a 16-bit addressbus on the CPU but the address bus was actually 20-bits, how this happened is thatthe Intel 8086 chips would waste an extra cycle to produce a address word of 20-bits,by using 16-bits of one word and 4 of another. This is why in some 8086 assembly programsyou might see hexadecimal numbers to address memory like this: [00bb:aafe]. In factthe 8086 is the virtual machine for Intel chips following the 386 release. It's not efficientnor easy to use word sizes of 20-bits, 10-bits without loss as internally computersuse 8, 16, 32, or 64 bit data busses. So your addressing of memory changes in purportion..Indirect storage media like tapes, flash cards, and such, where the address word isloaded into the device before reading out the data (rather than sending the entiredata word to the device), the storage on such devices can be of any length..a----I changed the text from "byte is a basic unit of storage" becausebit is a basic unit of storage, byte is derived.: It could just as easily be said that the byte is the basic unit and the bit comes from making eighths of a byte. --Ihope127 17:25, 5 September 2005 (UTC)A few years ago I too thought byte meant 8 bits and my eyes were opend (by a lisp hacker as it happens).

Jay 18:36, 30 August 2005 (UTC):A "bit" is the fundamental unit of digital information and can take on one of two values, commonly either ''zero'' or ''one''.  It takes a group of "bits" to define say a character, typically an eight bit group. This group of eight bits is called a "byte". There are exceptions to the eight bit grouping so this is a generalization. Now, imagine a long string of bits (zeros and ones) from which you take a "bite" exactly eight bits long and that each "bite" represents a number or letter. That is the concept (I think) that you were asking about. There was opportunity for confusion between the words "bit" and "bite" and so the word "byte" was coined to replace "bite" in an attempt to reduce the confusion. hydnjo talk 19:54, 30 August 2005 (UTC)::Thanks you've precisely answered my question.

This is based on a paragraph in one of the textbooks I used.  The textbook stated "binary table" in referring to a table which had the various characters we could view, on the left side, the ASCII decimal equivalent, to the right, a Hexa Decimal equivalent to its right, and a binary equivalent, at the very far right.  This was to demonstrate that the computer uses these combinations of binary digits (or BITs) to create all the characters and do all the actions we want the computer to show and do.  This does not dispute anything stated by anyone else.  It is only a definition, not a description of how it looks, nor does it state its size.  (User:  Amigan_1)Not "to bite" but "a bite"Here is a claim someone has made to coining the word byte.Here is an excerpt from a letter the author of that Byte magazine Letter (my father) wrote to me::On good days, we would have the XD-1 up and running and all the programs doing the right thing, and we then had some time to just sit and talk idly, as we waited for the computer to finish doing its thing.  On one such occasion, I coined the word "byte", they (Jules Schwartz and Dick Beeler) liked it, and we began using it amongst ourselves.  The origin of the word was a need for referencing only a part of the word length of the computer, but a part larger than just one bit...Many programs had to access just a specific 4-bit segment of the full word...I wanted a name for this smaller segment of the fuller word.  The word "bit" lead to "bite" (meaningfully less than the whole), but for a unique spelling, "i" could be "y", and thus the word "byte" was born.He was refering to "bite" as a noun not a verb, the definition of which is "less than the whole."  Webster.com defines it even better "an amount taken usually in one operation for one purpose," which is precisely what I think he meant.User:koydooleyIn support of this, I have heard the term "nybble" to be used to mean half a byte (as nibble might be half a bite).  i am not aware that "nybble" was in broad use, but everyone I worked with felt that byte came from being a bite of data, e.g. a part that could be taken and easily consumed.

Higher-level languages typically ''do not'' have an integral "byte" data type, though they may have a data type to represent characters (which is sometimes only for ASCII characters, sometimes more general). The C family (including Java) of course has bytes as integral types (called char), but there are other language families around....  --Macrakis 23:28, 25 February 2007 (UTC):Well, just to be clear here: C (programming language)|C and C++ have the "char" type, which is an integer data type capable of holding the smallest addressable unit of memory (actually that's "unsigned char", but no matter).

The phrase "I'm copying a page of memory into this buffer" is syntactically identical to "I'm copying a double-word of memory into this buffer."

A doubleword is 32 or 64 bits, but the bigger values I think are becoming standard.Likebox (talk) 00:23, 16 November 2008 (UTC):The past and current version of the C (language) Standard recognises that there are not always 8-bits in a byte in its definifinition of  macro. I agree that such machines are rare, but they do exist. Derek farn (talk) 02:39, 16 November 2008 (UTC):: Ok, sorry. I didn't know it's in the standard. But shouldn't the article discuss the current accepted usage first, and then discuss the very rare exceptions later? I think that's better than making a long confusing intro for such a simple concept. But maybe the article is clear enough as it is.Likebox (talk) 05:23, 16 November 2008 (UTC):Bytes with different numbers of bits are mostly obsolete these days, but may be worth mentioning. The high level description need not mention these but should avoid inaccuracy. I suggest something like the following: "Today, a byte universally contains 8 bits (but see ''History'' below for exceptions)." Or something. Dcoetzee 06:31, 16 November 2008 (UTC)::Dcoetzee, as you say non-8-bit bytes are "mostly obsolete" (while they did appear on older machines they sometimes appear in research machines, so obsolete is not quiet the right term).  This means a byte does not yet universally contain 8 bits.  How about "almost universally"? ISO communications standards got around this problem by defining the term octet. Derek farn (talk) 14:30, 16 November 2008 (UTC)::VSDSP signal processor has 16 bit bytes and it's definitely not obsolete. Probably other signal processors and special processors have non-8-bit word lengths too... Special:Contributions/195.197.254.3|195.197.254.3 (talk) 13:21, 14 August 2012 (UTC): The article quite adequately points out the situation with neutrality. There is no need to introduce additional word acrobatics. Kbrose (talk) 17:35, 16 November 2008 (UTC)uppercase "o"French-speaking countries sometimes use an uppercase "o" for "octet"[7].;/blockquote;First this is wrong, because I've never seen an uppercase "o" used here, only lowercase.Second, this is not what [the ref] states: French-speaking countries often use "o" for "octet", nowadays a synonym for byte, but this is unacceptable in SI because of the risk of confusion with the zero. There is no uppercase here.Third, and probably most important, this ref is using Wikipedia article SI prefix content, which is itself unsourced and doesn't claim that it is "unacceptable".Therefore I remove it and put it here. The following paragraph about the use of "octet" in non-english-speaking countries is sufficient.:French-speaking countries sometimes use an uppercase "o" for "octet". This is not consistent with SI because of the risk of confusion with the zero, and the convention that capitals are reserved for unit names derived from proper names, such as the ampere (whose symbol is A) and joule (symbol J), versus the second (symbol s) and metre (symbol m).Calimo (talk) 17:40, 1 February 2009 (UTC)Okay. Here's What I Think:I do not understand 95 percent of this article. And how wonderful. So what about Quantabytes. What is within a bit. A "nibble" or a "microbit"?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Himboy484wikidude (talk • Special:Contributions/Himboy484wikidude|contribs) 23:08, 6 September 2009 (UTC);;; ;;nibble is half an octet. Bit is the basic unit of information, there's nothing "within it". I understand the confusion, a bit, but it's really quite simple. Meters can be divided as needed, bits can't.

You either do or don't (1 or 0).

() SHayter (talk) 02:16, 18 July 2010 (UTC)Should be more conciseThis article, IMO, is a prime example of how Wikipedia can get far too lost in the details.  Shouldn't the very first sentence of the article get the common usage out of the way, the usage ~90% of readers are probably searching for?  Less technical readers are going to become extraordinarily confused by the time they reach the 5th sentence's still-not-very-concise explanation that "The size of a byte is typically hardware dependent, but the modern de facto standard is eight bits, as this is a convenient power of two."Shouldn't the very first sentences be something like:"A byte is a small unit of computer storage, typically 8 bits.  This common byte can represent values from 0 to 255.  However, some rare systems define a byte as a different, arbitrary number of bits such as"...[proceed to detailed explanation]Understand that I'm not trying to undervalue the notion that byte is not always 8 bits; this should definitely be mentioned.  But when the vast majority of the time it *is* 8 bits, why spend so much time FIRST talking about how it can be other sizes?  Isn't that better suited for LATER explanation?  The way the article is currently structured seems like trying to explain e-mail to a rookie by defining the data protocol... rather than telling them it's a way to send text over the internet.--Special:Contributions/76.117.251.119|76.117.251.119 (talk) 17:15, 7 November 2010 (UTC): You're absolutely right. I think you should go ahead and change the first sentence to your wording. Indefatigable (talk) 23:20, 8 November 2010 (UTC)French octetsThe real, unspoken reason that the French use "octets" instead of "bytes" is the fact that "byte" looks like a homophone of an obscene word in French, right?  Shouldn't that warrant a mention? Xezlec (talk) 17:14, 26 February 2011 (UTC): What French word are you referring to? ''Bitte'', which IIRC means "penis"? If someone can find a reliable source that gives this as the reason ''byte'' is not used in French, then it deserves a mention. Indefatigable (talk) 23:59, 27 February 2011 (UTC)Citation needed on decibel vs. decibyteWhy does the statement that a decibyte is never used require any citation at all? It is self-evident. Almost all computer systems use a byte composed of eight bits, and the bit is indivisible. Thus, decibytes are never used because they cannot exist on any computer system of any significance.
