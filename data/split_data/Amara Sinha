'''Amara Sinha''' (or '''Amara Simha'''Chambers) (c. CE 375) was a Sanskrit grammarian and poet, of whose personal history hardly anything is known.He is said to have been "one of the nine gems that adorned the throne of Vikramaditya," and according to the evidence of Xuanzang, this is the Chandragupta Vikramaditya (Chandragupta II) that flourished about CE 375.1911Other sources describe him as flourishing in c. CE 700."Amara-Simha" in ''Chambers's Encyclop√¶dia''. London: George Newnes, 1961, Vol. 1, p. 311.Most of his work was destroyed, with the exception of what is the celebrated ''Amara-Kosha'' (''Treasury of Amara''), a vocabulary of Sanskrit roots, in three books, and hence sometimes called ''Trikanda'' or the "Tripartite". 1911 It is also known as "Namalinganushasana".It contains 10,000 words, and is arranged, like other works of its class, in metre, to aid the memory. The first chapter of the ''Kosha'' was printed at Rome in Tamil character in 1798. An edition of the entire work, with English notes and an index by HT Colebrooke appeared at Serampore in 1808. The Sanskrit text was printed at Calcutta in 1831. A French translation by ALA Loiseleur-Deslongchamps was published at Paris in 1839. 1911Louie Rice compiled the Kannada version of it and its available 4th edition was printed in 1927 which contains three khandas and 25 sargas.References;Attribution*External links
