The '''Governor of Alabama''' is the chief executive of the U.S. state of Alabama. The governor is the head of the executive branch of Alabama's state government and is charged with enforcing state laws. The governor has the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Alabama Legislature, to convene the legislature, and to grant pardons, except in cases of impeachment. The governor is also the commander-in-chief of the state's military forces.There have officially been 53 governors of the state of Alabama; this official numbering skips acting and military governors."adah"The first governor, William Wyatt Bibb, served as the only governor of the Alabama Territory. Five people have served as acting governor, bringing the total number of people serving as governor to 58, spread over 63 distinct terms. Four governors have served multiple non-consecutive terms: Bibb Graves, Jim Folsom, and Fob James each served two, and George Wallace served three non-consecutive periods. Officially, these non-consecutive terms are numbered only with the number of their first term. William D. Jelks also served non-consecutive terms, but his first term was in an acting capacity.The longest-serving governor was George Wallace, who served sixteen years over four terms. The shortest term for a non-acting governor was that of Hugh McVay, who served four and a half months after replacing the resigning Clement Comer Clay. Lurleen Wallace, wife of George Wallace, was the first and so far only woman to serve as governor of Alabama, and the third woman to serve as governor of any state. The current governor is Republican Robert J. Bentley, who took office on January 17, 2011.GovernorsGovernor of the Territory of Alabama:''For the period before Alabama Territory was formed, see the list of Governors of Mississippi Territory.''Alabama Territory was formed on March 3, 1817, from Mississippi Territory. It had only one governor appointed by the President of the United States before it became a state; he became the first state governor.{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"!Picture!!Governor!!Term in office!!Appointed by|-|File:William Wyatt Bibb.jpg|75px|alt=Portrait of a man facing the right.|William Wyatt Bibb|March 6, 1817;ndash;December 14, 1819|James Monroe|}Governors of the State of AlabamaSeal for use by the Governor-ElectFile:Standard of the Governor of Alabama (1868–1939).svg|thumb|right|150px|Governor's Flag 1868–1939Alabama was admitted to the Union on December 14, 1819. It seceded from the Union on January 11, 1861 and was a founding member of the Confederate States of America on February 4, 1861; there was no Union Alabama government in exile, so there was a single line of governors. Following the end of the American Civil War, Alabama during Reconstruction was part of the Third Military District, which exerted some control over governor appointments and elections. Alabama was readmitted to the Union on July 14, 1868.The first Alabama Constitution, ratified in 1819, provided that a governor be elected every two years, limited to serve no more than four out of every six years.1819 Const. art. IV, § 4 This limit remained in place until the constitution of 1868, which simply allowed governors to serve terms of two years.1868 Const. art. V, § 2 The current constitution of 1901 increased terms to four years,AL Const. art. V, § 114 but prohibited governors from succeeding themselves.AL Const. art. V, § 116 Amendment 282 to the constitution, passed in 1968, allowed governors to succeed themselves once. The constitution had no set date for the commencement of a governor's term until 1901, when it was set at the first Monday after the second Tuesday in the January following an election."const-art5sec116"The office of lieutenant governor was created in 1868,1868 Const. art. V, § 1 abolished in 1875,1875 Const. art. V, § 1 and recreated in 1901.AL Const. art. V, § 112 According to the current constitution, should the governor be out of the state for more than 20 days, the lieutenant governor becomes acting governor, and if the office of governor becomes vacant the lieutenant governor fully becomes governor.AL Const. art. V, § 127 Earlier constitutions said the powers of the governor devolved upon the successor, rather than them necessarily becoming governor,1819 Const. art. IV, § 18; 1861 Const. art. IV, § 18; 1865 Const. art V, § 19; 1868 Const. art. V, § 15; 1875 Const. art. V § 15 but the official listing includes these as full governors. The governor and lieutenant governor are not elected on the same ticket.Alabama was a strongly Democratic state before the Civil War, electing only candidates from the Democratic-Republican and Democratic parties. It had two Republican governors following Reconstruction, but after the Democratic Party re-established control, 112 years passed before voters chose another Republican.; Parties{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"!#Repeat governors are officially numbered only once; subsequent terms are marked with their original number italicized.!Picture!colspan="2"|Governor!Term in office!Party!TermEach term for which a governor is elected is listed here; if multiple governors served in a single term, due to resignations, deaths, and the like, then that term will be shared among those governors.
