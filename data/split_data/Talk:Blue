A different mechanism to the usual, but blue nevertheless.*the sky appears blue most of the time (not sunsets or sunrises so much) because it bounces the 'blue' wavelengths sideways. But just because the [colour is caused] by the selective redirecting of some wavelengths, rather than by absorption or emission it doesn't mean it's not just as real. When something appears a colour it "is" that colour. Colour is only in appearance, and yet in normal parlance we say "the light is green", "the cup is red".

Although a source has been cited directly, the source contains wrong information. The section on institutions in the article about the Holy Roman Empire reads as follows: ''The Holy Roman Empire was not a highly centralized state like most countries today. Instead, it was divided into dozens—eventually hundreds—of individual entities governed by kings, dukes, counts, bishops, abbots and other rulers, collectively known as princes. There were also some areas ruled directly by the Emperor. At no time could the Emperor simply issue decrees and govern autonomously over the Empire. His power was severely restricted by the various local leaders.'' Conclusion: The source probably refers to the Holy Roman Empire, wich had no government, but an Emperor. Even the Emperor couldn't "outlaw" the use of indigo, because of the decentralised nature of the Empire and refering to him as the "German government" is also highly questionable.

SiefkinDR (talk) 13:46, 12 February 2015 (UTC)There are a few differences in the text that also need to be resolved;  the lead currently gives a different wavelength of blue than the info box and the section on optics in the article, and the etymology of blue is explained differently in the lead than it is in the article.  I think these can be fixed without much trouble.:I agree with ditching the shades and agree there is no need for oppposite colours.

It will make the images a little larger, and will eliminate a lot of wasted space between and around the images.  I will do several galleries to show what it would look like, and invite your comments.    Cordially, SiefkinDR (talk) 11:23, 1 January 2016 (UTC)Pink and blue for boys and girlsIn the section on Gender, this article says, "Blue was first used as a gender signifier just prior to World War I (for either girls or boys), and first established as a male gender signifier in the 1940s." This is referenced to an article in Smithsonian. This doesn't look right.Blue for boys and pink for girls was first enunciated in 1870 by writer and social reformer Kate Gannett Wells. By the 1880s the rule was firmly established in much of the US. Then, in the November, 1890 edition of Ladies' Home Journal, dressmaker Emma M. Hooper proposed an opposite rule, which began to catch on in parts of the country where no rule had yet been observed. For the next several decades the two rules coexisted in different regions. Then, around 1920, printers of birth announcements (among others) began calling for nationwide standardization of baby colors, urging that the nation go with majority rule. Over the next 20 years, the "blue for girls" rule began to fade away, until by 1940 it was pronounced officially dead. Zyxwv99 (talk) 23:00, 3 January 2016 (UTC):This is interesting stuff.  But you need a source that can be cited for it.  If you have one then it certainly could and should be included. --Escape Orbit;/font; (Talk) 23:31, 3 January 2016 (UTC)::You can find references in one of my sandboxes here User:Zyxwv99/sandbox8. I'm still researching this, but this research paper would probably be a good one to include:  Zyxwv99 (talk) 00:03, 4 January 2016 (UTC):::Excellent.  Looks like you're doing a thorough job and there's certainly an article to be had on this subject alone.  Look forward to your results on this page. --Escape Orbit;/font; (Talk) 16:47, 4 January 2016 (UTC)Mentions in ancient literatureAccording to , William Gladstone counted mentions of colours in the Odyssey and found there to be not a single mention of blue. Lazarus Geiger did this for other forms of ancient literature – the Indian Vedas, the Aryan Avesta, the Icelandic sagas, and also found few mentions. This issue could form an interesting para in the article and doesn't really seem to be covered as yet. Malick78 (talk) 20:17, 17 February 2016 (UTC):I've seen this before. It's pseudoscience. It could still have a place in this article, but only if we provide solid references to debunk it. Admitedly our ancestors have experienced changes in their vision, but on a much longer time-scale. About 90 million years ago we lost our blue cones, which is why the ones we share with other placental mammals are actually violet cones. The platypus lost the violet cone, but has blue cones. The first mammal lost the red cone. Nearly all vertebrates are tetrachromats, most mammals are dichromats, but simians (including us) are usually trichromats. The first vertebrate, circa 550 mya, was a tetrachromat and could see blue. One thing that's changed is the names we give to colors. Isaac Newton's blue was our sky blue. Our modern blue was his azure. Zyxwv99 (talk) 00:56, 18 February 2016 (UTC)
