The municipality straddles the Limfjord, the waterway which connects the North Sea and the Kattegat east-to-west, and which separates the main body of the Jutland peninsula from the island of Vendsyssel-Thy north-to-south. It has a land area of 1,143.99km², population 197,426 (2010)"FOLK1: Population 1 January"and belongs to Region Nordjylland ("North Jutland Region").It is also the name of the municipality's main city Aalborg and the site of its municipal council, as well as the name of a seaport.The municipality and the town have chosen to retain the traditional spelling of the name as ''Aalborg'', although the new spelling ''Ålborg'' is used in other contexts, such as Ålborg Bight (''Ålborg Bugt''), the body of water which lies to the east of the Jutland peninsula.Municipal reform of 2007As of 1 January 2007 Aalborg municipality joined with the municipalities of Hals, Nibe, and Sejlflod to form a new Aalborg municipality.

It belonged to North Jutland County.GeographySurroundingsThe waters in the Limfjord splitting the municipality are called ''Langerak'' to the east and ''Gjøl Bredning'' to the west.  The island of Egholm is located in ''Gjøl Bredning'', and is connected by ferry to the city of Aalborg at its southern shore.The area is typical for the north of Jutland.  To the west the Limfjord broadens into an irregular lake (salt water), with low, marshy shores and many islands.  Northwest is Store Vildmose ("Greater Wild bog"), a swamp where a mirage is sometimes seen in summer. Southeast lies the similar Lille Vildmose ("Lesser Wild bog").  Store Vildmose was drained and farmed in the beginning of the 20th century, and Lille Vildmose is now the largest moor in Denmark.Urban areas in Aalborg MunicipalityAalborg City has a total population at 123,432.
