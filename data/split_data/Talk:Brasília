Not all public buildings are nyemeyers, and  the city plan was widely based on Le Corbusier ideas, so i thought it was fair to mention him.There is no lack of sidewalks in Brasilia, since the begginnings it was decided the sidewalks would be built where people walked on, leaving a track in the grass.You can find me at oitoparafusos@hotmail.com. My name is Mauricio Manco. user:manco..............................................................................Hello Mauricio, I disagree with You about the sidewalks. Usually the books that criticize Brasilia when it was still being built (60s and 70s). There are lots of places where there are no sidewalks, for example the embassy sectors.Dionisiojunonijo@yahoo.comÉ claro que faltavam  calçadas nos anos setenta, elas seriam construidas, e foram, em muitos lugares mas nem todos. Elas são construídas onde o povo anda a pé.Of course there was a lack of sidewalks in the seventies, they where to be built, and they was, in a lot of places but not ALL of them. They are built where people usually walk on.(manco)* For all Brasilia residents (and even more for the Satellite-Cities residents) it's clear that the city wasn't planed for walkers. There's a big distance between places of interest (and need) and the sidewalks are not a beautiful view (either lacking, cracked or else not covering the best way, most of the time). At the other hand, some Brasilia residents like me and Mauricio Manco really know how fun and interesting can it be to walk along the wings (north or south one). Brasilia is a place of contradictions, but as put by Tom Robbins in his book Villa Incognito, "what city is not"? danielduende 19:58, 31 October 2005 (UTC)I made a small correction: the 1891 Brazilian constitution was Brazil's first REPUBLICAN constitution.

I agree that the English is not proper written.------------------------------------------------------------I agree, even though I have added a few things off and on to try to improve it and I have corrected some of the English.  As I found this article on 27 November 2005 there were serious problems with not only the English but with some statements.  What is the factual basis for the statement that Lucio Costa designed Brasilia without traffic lights only because his wife had been killed in one?  That sounds like an urban legend to me.  The reason is probably more likely to be found in the more pragmatic desire to create a city that was a break with the traditional one, which had traffic lights.  I got rid of the statement because it certainly does not help the article and it is mentioned again further on in the article. I lived in Brasilia for twenty years and I never heard that explanation, which does not necessarily mean it could not have any basis of course.  But to affirm such a thing we need a reputable source.Ray Vogensen vogensen@portcult.comPlano?I think that the translation of "Plano Piloto" is incorrect, but I don't know whether it should be "Pilot Plain" or "Pilot Plane" instead.  I think that both are correct translations, and one of the translations makes a good pun, but I am unsure of how Brasilians mean this phrase.  Plain = geographic feature, Plane = flat geometric featureWhat about Pilot Plan? It's a planned city afterall.: If we would go for an exact translation, i would drop the word Pilot for something else... like '''Main''', '''First''' or '''Core''', words that are closer to the original meaning of "Piloto". On the other hand, the translation of Plano as Plan (and not Plain or Plane) is a very good idea. danielduende 19:50, 31 October 2005 (UTC)::"'''Pilot Plan'''" is the most direct translation of "''Plano Piloto''" and the "pilot" part gives it the double entendre that's present in the Portuguese phrase. The double meaning inplied by "plane" is not an accurate translation because aeroplane in Portuguese is "'''''avião'''''" (from '''''ave''''', meaning bird, + '''''-ão''''', the augmentive suffix in Portuguese). And when "'''piloto/a'''" is used as an adjective, it is usually talking about a initiative, project or plan. Morganfitzp 15:20, 21 July 2006 (UTC)It shouldn't be translated at all.

American In Brazil (talk) 00:57, 6 May 2014 (UTC)City PlanningThe end of the article says that the city is constantly under construction. Is that true???? A city constantly being under construction sounds '''Too Good To Be True'''. Besides, if that is indeed the case, sooner or later, it'll turn the planet into an Ecumenopolis, like Coruscant.It is the first all new modern city.To reply, please leave a message in my User Talk. Feel free to type your reply onto this page too.* As a matter of fact Brasilia is "constantly under construction", really. There is still a lot of vacant spaces for building and there is a lot of things that were planned but never built, until now. Our actual governor, Joaquim Roriz has a personal taste for building big, flashy and severely over-budgeted things too. Our subway system was more expensive to build than the Rio de Janeiro subway system (that is at least 6 times bigger and way better). Maybe someday, being a "constantly under construction" city, Brasília overtakes all the space and become some kind of "Ecumenopolis", but this day is very far indeed. Brasília is, in the way we like to refer to it, the "largest small town of Brasil, and a very strange and fascinating one".

Thanks for clarification.--Muchosucko 14:19, 16 August 2005 (UTC)There is a problem with the whole article, in that it can't decide whether "Brasília" means the huge city which is Brazil's capital, or just the central area (Plano Piloto) that constitutes its First Administrative Region (if it is the latter, it does not have 2,000,000 inhabitants, but just about 250,000. If the former, then it includes the satellite cities, and, in fact, all of the Distrito Federal~). User:Ninguém|Ninguém (User talk:Ninguém|talk) 01:23, 16 June 2009 (UTC)I believe ´Brasilia´ means the city proper, of which Plano Piloto is the central district, whereas the satellite cities (or ´suburbs´ as we would say in English) constitute the metro area. The metro area probably incorporates the entire Distrito Federal, so the population of the DF plus Brasilia is the metro population. There are a number of large satellite cities, such as Planaltina, Samambaia, Aguas Claras, Taguatinga, Ceilandia, Paranoá and Sobradinho where I live.

Brasília is a name given to the current Federal District or, alternatively and less frequently, just to the most important areas therein.

However, in Portuguese there is a stress mark (acute) over the first 'i' to conform to the Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement of 1990 that if a word ends in 'a', 'e', 'o', 'em' or 'ens' (the plural of 'em' as in 'homens' - men), the stress is on the penultimate (sometimes called the ´anti-tabulum´), or next-to-last syllable, as you note, UNLESS there is an acute, in which case the stress is on the acuted syllable. Portuguese is a highly stressed language, like English. A single 's' in the middle of a word is sounded like the English 'z', hence the English spelling of the country 'Brazil' (´Brasil´ in Portuguese) and the pronunciation of 'Brasilia' with a 'z' sound.  The 'i' in Portuguese is generally sounded like 'ee' in English, as in the English word 'machine' (which is from French - oh, those Normans). However, 'i' in front of 'a' or 'o' is monosyllabic; thus the 'ia' is slurred into a single syllable. Gosh, there sure are a lot of rules!

The figure currently listed is for the city itself and does not include the suburban areas.American In Brazil (talk) 22:55, 16 March 2015 (UTC):But a question remains: what is the area of city itself? The map gives it roughly 1/10 of the district, but the figure is never given. If there is a source for the map, it should have the area also, or what?

I doubt Brasília was either.  Is this trying to say that it was officially declared the capital on that day?Special:Contributions/216.31.219.19|216.31.219.19 (talk) 19:33, 12 July 2014 (UTC)Yes, that was the day that Brasilia was officially declared the national capital and the federal government was transferred from Rio de Janeiro. The city was under construction for 44 months prior to that date and only government buildings were constructed. Since then Brasilia has grown into a major city and continues to be a work in progress.American In Brazil (talk) 18:13, 26 November 2014 (UTC)ModernismNot a lot on modernism, Brasilia is the only city entirely planned around the most influential ideology in architecture and planning.The circumstances behind, and the thoughts guiding, the planning of Brasilia are the most important aspects of it.What do you think?I agree with you (whoever you are) and since Brasilia is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, perhaps more should be said about the planning and architecture. Someone more familiar with this subject than I could make a contribution.American In Brazil (talk) 20:52, 19 January 2015 (UTC)Timeline of BrasíliaWhat is missing from the recently created city timeline article?
