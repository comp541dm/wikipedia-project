Someone added to the list of ways British Citizenship could be acquired::By descent from Sophia of Hanover and not practicing Catholicism (i.e. anyone in line for the throne of Great Britain)This was the case, when 4 ; 5 Ann. c. 16, "An Act for the Naturalisation of the Most Excellent Princess Sophia of Electress of Hanover and the Issue of her Body" was in force; but that act has been repealed. (I cannot remember which act does it, it may have been the British Nationality Act 1914 or the Naturalization Act 1870...)Also, that act only ever applied to British subject status; not British citizenship.  -- Simon J Kissane.----It appears that this act was repealed in 1948 and so only applies to those born before 1948.It was still in force and Prince Phillip of Greece was embarrassed when after marrying Elizabeth and applying for and receiving citizenship, it was found that others of his family could received it legally on the Sophia clause alone. Well, I presume he was embarrassed. Prince Ernst August of Hanover fought a court battle and received his citizenship in 1956 on the Sophia Naturalization Act.Also the In America that phrasing would mean citizenship but in England? --rmhermen----As I understand it "natural born subjects" would make them British subjects within the meaning of the 1914 Act, and hence (most likely) Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies within the meaning of the 1948 Act, and hence (most likely) British Citizens within the meaning of the 1981 Act. -- Simon J Kissane
