I did not write this entry; it came from an old public domain source.  Feel free to update or expand it. --KQA minimal bit of editing, Wikification, and the addition of an easily found fact or two from the web increases the value of these articles tremendously.  EB11 is a great source, but it's just that--one source.  Always add some value to a copied article to make Wikipedia something worth searching.  --LDCIt was my intention to, but it's easier for me to add the text now and update it later.  If you'd prefer me not to, I won't.  --KQOh please do add more.  Your adding it gives me a great incentive to modify it.  I hate copying, but I love editing; you and I should make a good team.   I wouldn't automatically create the "Talk" pages though just to mention the source.  It doesn't matter where it came from, once you've entered it here it's ''ours''.  --LDCI put the "talk" pages there to disclaim ownership of it; people have already asked me about two articles I moved from another OddlyCapitalize page, but did not write.  I will add more info to the articles I added today.  --KQ----This page is an orphan. Could you find some articles to point to it?
