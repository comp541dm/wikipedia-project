;;Same street name 5 times.Heard this interesting tidbit.  I heard someone say because of municipal annexation, Boston wound up with the irregularity where it has the same street name 5 times and they don't necc. connect at all...  I found them.  Washington St. is the name.*Washington Street. Charlestown (Boston) is to the southeast of the Bunker Hill Community College. It proceeds a few blocks and then stops.*Washington Street, Downtown (Boston proper), begins at old State House (junction with Court Street and State Street, proceeds southward, passes through Dudley, proceeds out to Jamaica Plain where it turns into Hyde Park Ave..*Washington Street, Jamaica Plain, forms anew on the opposite side of Hyde Park Avenue/Forest Hills T station, and proceeds through Hyde Park + Roselindale eventually ends out in town of Walpole.*Washington Street, Dorchester, begins in Grove Hall, Dorchester at Blue Hill Avenue, proceeds south, and ends in Dorchester Lower Mills near Milton.*Washington Street, Newton Corner (at Mass. Pike) proceeds through (Brighton, Boston); continues to town of Brookline ending near Route 9/Riverway. CaribDigita (talk) 08:33, 14 April 2015 (UTC)Double vandalismI have noticed a pattern of deliberate double vandalism from two separate accounts (both created recently and used only for vandalism). The more recent vandalism gets quickly reverted by Cluebot or manually, but the earlier vandalism persists unless it is also manually reverted. This pattern has been used on other Wikipedia articles, with similar results. New accounts include at least User:Brianbarnaby1, User:Name changerman 46, User:Changer10921, User:Down200, and User:Wikitroll51198.  Only the last account has been blocked as of this writing.I want to alert other editors to this trick, so that they can look more carefully when reverting, and also check for further unnoticed vandalism. WP:PROTECT may be needed, and I also wonder if there is any other mechanism to watch for this trick at a broader level, or to alert other editors.

Thank you. -- M2545 (talk) 15:39, 19 May 2015 (UTC)Image overloadBoston has to be the most flagrant example of image overload I have ever seen on a featured article. How it was allowed to fall apart so spectacularly, and how it's still granted featured status, is puzzling to say the least. - HappyWaldo (talk) 03:45, 14 July 2015 (UTC):HappyWaldo This article seems to have an issue with images creeping into it over time. This was a concern at the Wikipedia:Featured article review/Boston/archive1|last FA review. It had 35 images after that review, it now has 72. I believe a pruning is in order. '''Winner 42'''  User talk: Winner 42|Talk to me!  04:26, 14 July 2015 (UTC)::I would suggest getting rid of the gallery at the bottom, as well as images of the same subject. If a building appears in the lead montage then it almost certainly doesn't need to be represented elsewhere in the article. (Re)move images to avoid squashing text. Stacking panoramas of city skylines is another unfortunate trend. I'm hesitant to make any of these changes myself because I don't know much about Boston. - HappyWaldo (talk) 04:43, 14 July 2015 (UTC):::The gallery actually serves some useful function, as a place for good photos that aren't immediately relevant to the text of the article. Its existence makes it easier to rigorously require that all other photos ''be relevant to the text they are inserted next to''. After setting up a gallery in other articles, I have found it to be easier to move irrelevant photos out of the main text, and to later prune the gallery of excessive and redundant ones without getting a lot of protests and re-insertions. I do agree that the article has accumulated too many photos, and needs to be pruned.  Reify-tech (talk) 05:33, 14 July 2015 (UTC)::::Wikipedia is not an image repository WP:NOTGALLERY. If readers want to look at a wall of Boston-related images they can go to Wiki Commons, Flickr, or a tourism website. Otherwise images should only be used where they're actually needed. - HappyWaldo (talk) 05:46, 14 July 2015 (UTC)::::: Houston's another FA article which is suffering from this same problem. This article definitely needs photo trimming. I too agree with WP:NOTGALLERY, and I've had exactly the opposite experience than Reify-tech, in that editors have argued more about including stuff in the gallery (or creating a gallery). Perhaps an RfC at US Cities is in order? It's kind of like when you decorate a house: it can be tastefully done, and wall ornamentation can add to the room's ambience, or you can cram a picture or knick-knack into every square inch of open space, which simply looks cluttered.

The current one has some very average shots and falls under WP:NOTGALLERY. - HappyWaldo (talk) 11:58, 27 July 2015 (UTC)"Boston Museum"Boston MuseumWhat is this building? Thanks. I looked the Boston Museum disambiguation page but the results didn't easily resolve the issue. Thanks. OrganicEarth (talk) 21:48, 26 July 2015 (UTC):It looks like Tremont Street since the King's burial ground appears to be in the right corner. I believe it's just office buildings now.  â€”Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/149.101.1.120|149.101.1.120 (talk) 20:56, 7 October 2015 (UTC);;; ;;The Irish population in BostonWhen did the Irish become either the largest ethnic group or the majority of Boston's population? I would like to know and may be included in the study of Irish culture in Boston. Either this happened between 1850 and 1880, the peak of Irish immigration to the USA and a large proportion of Irish immigrants settled in Boston, except New York City has more Irish by numbers. The South Shore (Massachusetts) region about 25 miles south of Boston now has the US' highest percentage of ethnic Irish descent and the highest percentage of Irish in any town in the South Shore has to be 60 percent.
