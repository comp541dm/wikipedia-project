UntitledIsn't a blowfish a kind of, well, fish?  And what about Hootie and the?Errr, possibly, but not in my country. I guess this is the reason that the data compression algorithms are all subpages. Maybe encryption algorithms should be too, to make sure they don't clash with more mundane topics of the same name. Not a problem for RC4 and triple-Des, but there is a Tiger and a Serpent. Anyway, i just wrote this because there was an open link to it from one of the crypto pages. Better track that down and fix it if this moves.Added a note on the same.  The fish is usually called a puffer, so the collision between the two isn't too bad. :)----What does "symmetric, secret key, block cypher" mean? --LMSdatabase error? please check it...look at screenshot:article Blowfish is ''mixed'' with Dopamine (disambiguation):bug was fixedpha patti:now everything is OK
