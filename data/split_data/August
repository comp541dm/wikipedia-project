File:Reeve and Serfs.jpg|thumb|Depiction of harvesting in the August calendar page of the Queen Mary Psalter (fol. 78v), ca. 1310.'''August''' ( ) is the eighth month of the year (between July and September) in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and one of seven months with a length of 31 days."[August]." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2008. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 23 September 2008.In the Southern Hemisphere, August is the seasonal equivalent of February in the Northern Hemisphere. In many European countries, August is the holiday month for most workers. The Perseid meteor shower peaks during July and August.This month was originally named ''Sextilis'' in Latin, because it was the sixth month in the original ten-month Roman calendar under Romulus in 753 BC, when March was the first month of the year. About 700BC it became the eighth month when January and February were added to the year before March by King Numa Pompilius, who also gave it 29 days. Julius Caesar added two days when he created the Julian calendar in 45 BC giving it its modern length of 31 days. In 8 BC it was renamed in honor of Augustus (despite common belief, he did not take a day from February; see the debunked theory on month lengths). According to a Senatus consultum quoted by Macrobius, he chose this month because it was the time of several of his great triumphs, including the conquest of Egypt.August is the month with highest birth rate in the USA.Month-long observances* National Lawn Games Month (United States)* American Adventures Month (celebrating vacationing in the Americas)* Audio Appreciation Month* Children's Eye Health and Safety Month* National Children's Vision and Learning Month (United States)* Digestive Tract Paralysis (DTP) Month* Get Ready for Kindergarten Month* Happiness Happens Month* Month of Philippine Languages (Philippines)* National Back to School Month (United States)* National Black Business Month (United States)* National Goat Cheese Month.Bober, Mike. ] Month with Local Favorites], dcfoodies.com (United States)* National Immunization Awareness Month (United States)* National Panini Month* National Water Quality Month (United States)* Neurosurgery Outreach Month* Psoriasis Awareness Month* Spinal Muscular Atrophy Awareness Month* What Will Be Your Legacy Month* Win with Civility Month* Catfish Month* Family Meals Month"unl-aug"* Get Acquainted with Kiwifruit Month"unl-aug"* National Dippin' Dots Month"unl-aug"* Peach Month"unl-aug"* Sandwich Month"unl-aug"Other events in August*Construction Holiday (Quebec) (July 19–August 2)*Farmer's Market Week 2015 date: August 5–11*Family Day First Weekend in August*Māori Language Week (New Zealand) 2015 date: July 27–August 2*World Water Week in Stockholm 2015 date: August 23–28*International Clown Week (August 1–7)*World Breastfeeding Week (August 1–7)* The Perseid meteor shower always takes place in around July and August.
