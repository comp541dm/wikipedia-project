UntitledPlease see .  Hmm...this is too close to "academic plagiarism" for my taste.Everyone, can you please have a look at JamieTheFoool's work to make sure it's not similarly questionable?  I lack the time right now...voltage converter blown.I'm thinking this should be filed under "Co. Fermanagh" or "County Fermanagh", or even "Co. Fermanagh, Ireland", given that there are American counties with the same names as the Irish ones.  (E.g., Donegal in Pennsylvania.) --LMSI think we will run into huge problems if we start organising Wikipedia geographic articles on original placenames across the world by obscure American county and village versions of the name that are unknown to anyone else Chrisleigh 12:28, 22 February 2007 (UTC)Hmm... Given that there is a common US usage of the form "Hicksville Alabama" or "Paris Texas", and that such usage is virtually unknown in the UK and Ireland (ie. the place is just called London or Fermanagh or whatever), and given that County Fermanagh in Ireland can reasonably make the prior claim, I reckon we should keep it as it is - with a link to "Other Fermanaghs" should it prove necessary. --PaulCounty CrestWords on county crest should be in English rather than Irish considering the counties location and political status 86.131.202.57 23:07, 30 October 2005 (UTC):: Why does this article use the GAA Crest instead of the County Crest? :: Keith :: 13:20, 3 December 2005 (UTC):::Becaus a person took the GAA crest to be the same as the county crest, which before the new versions of the GAA crests began being used, were similar. But i see you made the change anyway, though i ma not sure that the crest you posted is the country crest, as even you stated on the image page the crest is that of the Fermanagh Distict Council, and being that the tradational conties have no political status in the north, i am not sure the district crest would be the same one used by the county, or was used by the county? --Boothy443 | User talk:Boothy443| trácht ar 20:46, 3 December 2005 (UTC):::: You could be right, as I just did a Google Image search for "Fermanagh Crest", so that could just be the DCA crest. If you come accross the County Crest please update the one I posted. :: Keith :: 20:50, 3 December 2005 (UTC):::::Possibly i am not sure either way, for no i suppose it works. I seriously douubt that an official creat could be found from back when the county was a county, or something, if anything it would be a heardeicalic crest used for genaealogy purposes. --Boothy443 | User talk:Boothy443| trácht ar 21:22, 3 December 2005 (UTC):::::BTW i retagged the image so their is a more appropate useage tag or i should say tags for it. --Boothy443 | User talk:Boothy443| trácht ar 21:25, 3 December 2005 (UTC)Famous people from FermanaghI would debate that Neil Hannon (The Divine Comedy) is ''from'' Fermanagh or brought up there. He was certainly educated there, at Portora Royal School, but was brought up in Fivemiletown, which is decidedly in Tyrone. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by Dmccormac (talk • Special:Contributions/Dmccormac|contribs) 20:18, 11 April 2007 (UTC).;;;* Neil Hannon lived in Enniskillen before his da moved the family to FMT.MapThe map's a bit rubbish isn't it? --John 16:14, 11 July 2007 (UTC)::::I uploaded a newer county map on par with the county maps for counties of ireland. these maps highlights the position of the county within the island of Ireland as well as Northern Ireland thus satisfying the pattern shown for the other county maps. I am aware that the other maps was just of Northern Ireland counties, however the location of the county on an "island-wide" basis is more beneficial to tourists and is a compromise that should satisfy both Nationalists and Unionists. --User:Ro2000|RÓNÁNUser_talk:Ro2000|"Caint / Talk";17:18, 11 September 2007 (UTC)PronunciationGreetings from your namesake, Fermanagh Avenue in Toronto, Canada.  My street takes it's name because it was the birthplace of Colonel Walter O'Hara.Recently our public transit system (the Toronto Transit Commission) has installed automated stop calling machines - a recorded voice announces the street name as the stop approaches.The issue: the recorded voice is saying fer-ma-NAW.  I say "fer-MAN-ah".  Given that the street is a namesake of your county, how do you pronounce it?Thanks. Happy wanderer (talk) 16:09, 17 December 2007 (UTC)As a related issue - the final IPA symbol in the proposed pronunciation of Fermanagh (/fɚr'mænɘ/) is Close-mid central unrounded vowel|ɘ, the symbol for the close-mid central unrounded vowel, something that I find highly unusual. is it not much more likely that what is meant here is a mere shwa Mid central vowel|ə? Compare the sound examples for both, to clarify. Please, whoever proposed this pronunciation check this. If noone objects, I will change it.IagoUser_talk:Iago4096|212;/font; 22:24, 23 March 2009 (UTC):Yes, your version is correct Iago; I wouldn't have realised this myself since I know little of the IPA system! Well spotted. In answer to Happy wanderer's question (although it comes a little late), you are correct; the pronunciation over here puts the stress on the second syllable, "fer-MAN-ah".

Statistics are no longer collected on a county basis in Northern Ireland for the UK Census (nor have they been since the current 26 council areas came into being in the early 1970s) compiled and annlysed by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Reseacrh Agency whose website [NISRA.gov.uk] (which provides maps, tables, charts etc.) has proved exceptionally useful for these purposes. The District Council area includes a small rural piece of County Tyrone which lies just east of Irvinestown. This small rural piece of Tyrone lies in the Electoral Ward of Irvinestown within Fermanagh District Council area and for statistical purposes it is catagorised as Small Area N00002994. This used to be known (in the previous 2001 UK Census) as 95PP130002. In 2011 it had a population of 635. Therefore, an acurate figure of County Fermanagh's population can be does by taking this figure away from the figure given for the District Council area, 61,805, leaving us with a County population of 61,170.
