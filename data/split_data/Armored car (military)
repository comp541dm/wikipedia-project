300px|Eland Mk7 light armoured car at the South African Armour Museum, Bloemfontein.A military '''armored''' (or '''armoured''') '''car''' is a lightweight wheeled armored fighting vehicle, historically employed for reconnaissance, internal security, armed escort, and other subordinate battlefield tasks. With the gradual decline of mounted cavalry, armored cars were developed for carrying out duties formerly assigned to horsemen. Following the invention of the tank, the armored car remained popular due to its comparatively simplified maintenance and low production cost. It also found favor with several colonial armies as a cheaper weapon for use in underdeveloped regions. During World War II, most armored cars were engineered for reconnaissance and passive observation, while others were devoted to communications tasks. Some equipped with heavier armament could even substitute for tracked combat vehicles in favorable conditions;mdash;such as pursuit or flanking maneuvers during the North African Campaign."Bradford"Since World War II the traditional functions of the armored car have been occasionally combined with that of the armored personnel carrier, resulting in such multipurpose designs as the Cadillac Gage Commando."Bull"Postwar advances in recoil control technology have also made it possible for a few armored cars, including the AMX-10RC and EE-9 Cascavel, to carry large cannon capable of threatening many tanks.HistoryArmed carFile:Simms Motor Scout from Autocar.jpg|thumb|F.R. Simms' Motor Scout, built in 1898 as an armed car.The Motor Scout was designed and built by British inventor F.R. Simms in 1898. It was the first armed petrol engine-powered vehicle ever built. The vehicle was a De Dion-Bouton quadricycle with a mounted Maxim machine gun on the front bar. An iron shield in front of the car protected the driver.Another early armed car was invented by Royal Page Davidson at Northwestern Military and Naval Academy in 1898 with the Davidson-Duryea gun carriage and the later Davidson Automobile Battery armored car.However, these were not 'armored cars' as the term is understood today, as they provided no real protection for their crews against any kind of opposing fire. They were also, by virtue of their small capacity engines, far less efficient than the cavalry and horse-drawn guns that they were intended to complement.First armored carsAt the beginning of the 20th century, the first military armored vehicles were manufactured, by adding armor and weapons to existing vehicles.File:Simms Motor War Car 1902.jpg|thumb|left|F.R.

The armament, consisting of two Maxim guns, was carried in two turrets with 360° traverse. It had a crew of four. Simms' Motor War Car was presented at the Crystal Palace, London, in April 1902.File:Charron Girardot Voigt 1902.jpg|thumb|right|The earliest French armored car - the Charron-Girardot-Voigt 1902.Another early armoured car of the period was the French Charron, Girardot et Voigt 1902, presented at the ''Salon de l'Automobile et du cycle'' in Brussels, on 8 March 1902. The vehicle was equipped with a Hotchkiss machine gun, and with 7mm armour for the gunner.The Italians used armored cars during the Italo-Turkish War. A great variety of armored cars appeared on both sides during World War I and these were used in various ways.World War IGenerally, the armored cars were used by more or less independent car commanders. However, sometimes they were used in larger units up to squadron size. The cars were primarily armed with light machine guns, but larger units usually employed a few cars with heavier guns. As air power became a factor, armored cars offered a mobile platform for antiaircraft guns.Image:Rolls Royce 1920 Mk1 1 Bovington.jpg|thumb|left|A Rolls-Royce Armoured Car 1920 pattern;;The first effective use of an armored vehicle in combat was achieved by the Belgian Army in August–September 1914. They had placed Cockerill armour plating and a Hotchkiss machine gun on Minerva Armored Cars. Their successes in the early days of the war convinced the Belgian GHQ to create a Corps of Armoured Cars, who would be sent to fight on the Eastern front once the western front immobilized after the Battle of the Yser.The British Royal Naval Air Service dispatched aircraft to Dunkirk to defend the UK from Zeppelins. The officers' cars followed them and these began to be used to rescue downed reconnaissance pilots in the battle areas. They mounted machine guns on them and as these excursions became increasingly dangerous, they improvised boiler plate armoring on the vehicles provided by a local shipbuilder. In London Murray Sueter ordered "fighting cars" based on Rolls-Royce, Talbot and Wolseley chassis. By the time Rolls-Royce Armoured Cars arrived in December 1914, the mobile period on the Western Front was already over.''First World War'' - Willmott, H.P., Dorling Kindersley, 2003, Pg. 59 As described below, they had a fascinating birth and long and interesting service.More tactically important was the development of formed units of armoured cars, such as the Canadian Automobile Machine Gun Brigade, which was the first fully mechanized unit in the history of the British Army. The brigade was established on September 2, 1914 in Ottawa, as Automobile Machine Gun Brigade No. 1 by Brigadier-General Raymond Brutinel. The Brigade was originally equipped with 8 Armoured Autocars mounting 2 machine guns. By 1918 Brutinel's force consisted of two Motor Machine Gun Brigades (each of five gun batteries containing eight weapons apiece).P. Griffith p 129 "Battle Tactics on the Western Front - The British Army's art of attack 1916–18 Yale university Press quoting the Official History 1918 vol.4, p42 The brigade, and its armoured cars, provided yeoman service in many battles, notably at Amiens.Cameron Pulsifer (2007). ' 'The Armoured Autocar in Canadian Service' ', Service PublicationsThe Rolls-Royce Armoured Car was famously proposed, developed, and utilised  by the 2nd Duke of Westminster. He took a squadron of these cars to France in time to make a noted contribution to the Second Battle of Ypres, and thereafter the cars with their master were sent to the Middle East to play a part in the British campaign in Palestine and elsewhere. These cars appear in the memoirs of numerous officers of the BEF during the earlier stages of the Great War - their ducal master often being described in an almost piratical style.World War IIImage:UStankParis-edit1.jpg|thumb|upright|American troops in an M8 Greyhound passing the Arc de Triomphe after the liberation of Paris.The British Royal Air Force (RAF) in the Middle East was equipped with Rolls-Royce Armoured Cars;; and Morris tenders. Some of these vehicles were among the last of a consignment of ex-Royal Navy armored cars that had been serving in the Middle East since 1915.  In September 1940 a section of the No. 2 Squadron RAF Regiment Company was detached to Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|General Wavell’s ground forces during the first offensive against the Italians in Egypt. It is said that these armored cars became ‘the eyes and ears of Wavell’. During the actions in the October of that year the Company was employed on convoy escort tasks, airfield defense, fighting reconnaissance patrols and screening operations.File:Fordson Armoured Car Iraq.jpg|thumb|left|1941: A Fordson armoured car waits outside Baghdad while negotiations for an armistice take place between British officials and representatives of the 1941 Iraqi coup d'état|Iraqi rebel government.During the Anglo-Iraqi War, some of the units located in the British Mandate of Palestine were sent to Iraq and drove Fordson armored cars.  "Fordson" armored cars were Rolls-Royce armored cars which received new chassis from a Fordson truck in Egypt.Since the Treaty of Versailles did not mention armored cars, Germany began developing them early. By the start of the new war, the German army possessed some highly effective reconnaissance vehicles, such as the ''Schwerer Panzerspähwagen''.The Soviet BA-64 was influenced by a captured ''Leichter Panzerspähwagen'' before it was first tested in January 1942.In the second half of the war, the American M8 Greyhound and the British Daimler Armoured Cars featured turrets with light guns (40mm or less) mounted in turrets. As with other wartime armored cars, their reconnaissance roles emphasized greater speed and stealth than a tracked vehicle could provide, so their limited armor, armament and off-road capabilities were seen as acceptable compromises.Military useList of military armored carsFile:White M3A1.jpeg|thumb|A preserved, World War 2, American M3 Scout CarA military armored car is a type of armored fighting vehicle having wheels (from four to ten large, off-road wheels) instead of tracks, and usually light armor. Armored cars are typically less expensive and on roads have better speed and range than tracked military vehicles. They do however have less mobility as they have less off-road capabilities because of the higher ground pressure. They also have less obstacle climbing capabilities than tracked vehicles. Wheels are more vulnerable to enemy fire than tracks, they have a higher signature and in most cases less armor than comparable tracked vehicles. As a result, they are not intended for heavy fighting; their normal use is for reconnaissance, command, control, and communications, or for use against lightly armed insurgents or rioters. Only some are intended to enter close combat, often accompanying convoys to protect soft-skinned vehicles.Light armored cars, such as the British Ferret are armed with just a machine gun. Heavier vehicles are armed with autocannon or a small tank gun. The heaviest armored cars, such as the German, World War II era SdKfz 234 or the modern, US M1128 Mobile Gun System, mount the same guns that arm medium tanks.Image:DanishResistanceAC2795.jpg|thumb|left||Vehicle built by railway shop workers for the Danish resistance movement, near the end of World War 2Armored cars are popular for peacekeeping or internal security duties. Their appearance is less confrontational and threatening than tanks, and their size and maneuverability is said to be more compatible with tight urban spaces designed for wheeled vehicles. However they do have a larger turning radius compared to tracked vehicles which can turn on the spot and their tires are vulnerable and are less capable in climbing and crushing obstacles. However, when there is true combat they are easily outgunned and lightly armored. The threatening appearance of a tank is often enough to keep an opponent from attacking, whereas a less threatening vehicle such as an armored car is more likely to be attacked.Many modern forces now have their dedicated armored car designs, to exploit the advantages noted above. Examples would be the M1117 Armored Security Vehicle of the USA or Alvis Saladin of the post-World War II era in the United Kingdom.Alternatively, civilian vehicles may be modified into improvised armored cars in ''ad hoc'' fashion. Many militias and irregular forces adapt civilian vehicles into AFVs (armored fighting vehicles) and troop carriers, and in some regional conflicts these "technicals" are the only combat vehicles present. On occasion, even the soldiers of national militaries are forced to adapt their civilian-type vehicles for combat use, often using improvised armor and scrounged weapons.See alsoFile:Munster SdKfz234 4 side (dark1).jpg|thumb|A preserved, World War II, German SdKfz 234|SdKfz 234/4 heavy armored car (German Tank Museum, 2006)Soviet BRDM-2*Armored bus*Armored personnel carrier*Armored car (VIP)*Armoring:**Aramid**Bulletproof glass**Twaron**Vehicle armor*Gun truck*Tankette*Technical (vehicle)NotesReferences*Crow, Duncan, and Icks, Robert J., ''Encyclopedia of Armored Cars'', Chatwell Books, Secaucus, NJ, 1976.
