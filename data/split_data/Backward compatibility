In telecommunications and computing, a product or technology is '''backward compatible''' (BC) or '''downward compatible''' if it can function properly given Input/output|input generated by, or meant for, an older product or technology, such as a legacy system. If products designed for the new standard can receive, read, view or play older standards or formats, then the product is said to be backward-compatible; examples of such a standard include data formats and communication protocols. Modifications to a system that do not allow backward compatibility are sometimes called "breaking changes."The reverse is forward compatibility, which implies that old devices allow (or are expected to allow) data formats generated by ''new'' (or future) devices, perhaps without supporting all new features. A standard supports forward compatibility if older product versions can receive, read, view or play the new standard.For example, the introduction of FM stereo transmission allowed backward compatibility since new FM radio receivers could receive monaural signals generated by old transmitters. It also allowed forward compatibility, since old monaural FM radio receivers could still receive a signal from a new transmitter.In programming languages, backward compatibility refers to the ability of a compiler for version ''N'' of the language to accept programs or data that worked under version ''N'' - 1.  By this definition, if previous versions (''N'' - 1, ''N'' - 2, etc.) were also backward compatible, which is often the case, then, by induction, version ''N'' will also accept input that worked under any prior version after, and including, the latest one that was not backward compatible. However, in practice, features are often deprecated and support is dropped in a later release, which is yet thought of as backward compatible.In other contexts, a product or a technology is said to be backward compatible when it is able to fully take the place of an older product, by inter-operating with products that were designed for the older product.A data format is also said to be backward compatible with its predecessor if every message or file that is valid under the old format is also valid, and retains its meaning, under the new.DescriptionBackward compatibility is a relationship between two components, rather than being an attribute of just one of them. More generally, a new component is said to be backward compatible if it provides all of the functionality of the old component.''Backward'' compatibility is the special case of compatibility in which the new component has a direct historical ancestral relationship with the old component. If this special relationship does not exist then it not usually spoken of as "backward" compatibility but is instead just "compatible";mdash;a consistent interface allowing interoperability between components and products that were each developed separately.In the case of a program that creates document files, a new version of that program ("v2") is said to be backward compatible with the old version of the program ("v1") when it can both read and write documents that work with v1. Everything that v1 could do must also be possible with v2, including saving documents that can be read by v1 (which is something that v1 could do).If a newer software version cannot save files that can be read by the older version, it is not backward compatible with the older version, although it may provide an irreversible upgrade capability for the old files. This situation has often been used strategically by software vendors to force customers to purchase upgrades since, over time, the number of data files usable by an old version diminishes at a rate proportional to the number of other customers that have upgraded (assuming that all customers generate files at the same the average rate).Levels of compatibility vary. In software, ''binary compatibility'' and ''source compatibility'' are distinguishable. Binary compatibility means that programs can work correctly with the new version of this library without requiring recompilation. Source compatibility requires recompilation but no changes to the source code.Many platforms rely on emulation, the simulation of an older platform in software, to achieve backward compatibility.Many computer programs "know" their own software versioning number, and write that number somewhere in the data files they create.This makes relatively easy for a new program to be backwards compatible with files produced by several previous versions of a program.Even when the new program is unable to completely understand long-deprecated features in files produced by a much earlier version of the program, that new program can use that version number to help the user find some previous version of the program that can completely understand that file.Bugwards compatibleIf a newer system is attempting to achieve integration with an older system which has known flaws (or "bugs"), then the new system may be referred to as bug-compatible or "bugwards-compatible".Examples* The NTSC color broadcast system was engineered by RCA to be backward compatible with black-and-white NTSC television sets.* DVB-T MPEG4 television tuners can also decode MPEG2 signal.* Most DVD drives are able to play standard CDs, and most Blu-ray players can also play standard DVDs and CDs.* Numerous video game consoles are backward compatible and are able to play the games created for predecessor consoles.** The Atari 7800 is backward compatible with almost all Atari 2600 games.** The Sega 32X add-on is backward compatible with all Sega Genesis cartridges.** The Game Boy line and Nintendo DS line contain many instances of backwards-compatibility:*** The Game Boy Color is backward compatible with all Game Boy cartridges.*** The Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Advance SP are backward compatible with all Game Boy and Game Boy Color games.*** The Nintendo DS and the Nintendo DS Lite are backward compatible with all Game Boy Advance games.*** The Nintendo 3DS line are backward compatible with most Nintendo DS and Nintendo DSi software.** Similarly, the Wii U can play Wii games, and the Wii could play GameCube games.** The PlayStation 2 is backward compatible with most of the original PlayStation library. Likewise, earlier models of the PlayStation 3 could play most PlayStation 2 and (original) PlayStation games.** The Xbox 360 can play some Xbox games via software emulation. Similarly, the Xbox One can play some Xbox 360 games.* Microsoft Office products can read and write most files created by previous versions.* Several computer operating systems have various methods of running software originally designed for older versions or other OSes:** Mac OS 9 applications could be run on PowerPC versions of Mac OS X up to 10.4 Tiger.** 32-bit versions of Microsoft Windows can run 16-bit Windows software and some MS-DOS software.** 64-bit versions of Windows can run 32-bit software.** The Intel versions of Mac OS X from versions 10.4 (Tiger) to 10.6 (Snow Leopard) had Rosetta, a binary translation program that allowed applications meant for use on PowerPC Macs to run on Apple systems that use Intel processors.* The modern Nikon F-mount SLR camera lenses from the late 1970s - present (its design dates back to 1959) can function on the newer Nikon DSLR cameras with some limitations.* Lenses for the Canon EF-mount, introduced with the company's EOS family of film SLRs in 1987 and used to this day on Canon full-frame and APS-H EOS DSLRs, can function fully on the company's APS-C DSLRs that use the Canon EF-S-mount (although their angle of view will be different on the smaller APS-C sensor).* PCI Express 2.0 is backward compatible with PCI Express 1.1.* Universal Serial Bus (USB) ports support devices intended for earlier versions of USB. For example, USB 3.0 ports support USB 2.0 and USB 1.1 devices.* The IBM 7080 transistorized computer was backward compatible with all models of the IBM 705  vacuum tube computer.* When Touch Tone dialing was introduced into the telephone system, the network continued to work with the existing rotary telephones, a situation that continues today.* Telephones that used Pulse dialing were compatible with parts of the telephone network that did not yet work with tone dialing by mimicking the pulses generated by a rotary phone.See also*Computer compatibility*Downgrade attack*Flag day (software)*Format rot*Forward compatibility*Legacy system*Shim*Software emulation*Bidirectional compatibility*Binary code compatibility*Deprecation*Legacy mode*List of Xbox 360 games compatible with Xbox One*List of Xbox games compatible with Xbox 360*Multidirectional compatibility*ProgID*Source code compatibility*Video alternative to GIFReferencesExternal links*
