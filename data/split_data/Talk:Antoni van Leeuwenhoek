Antonie van LeeuwenhoekHistorical note''The previous discussion that was here was moved to Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (anglicization). The discussion was about the "correct" spelling of Leeuwenhook's first name. One person insisted that the Dutch spelling of "Antoni" should only be used because Leeuwenhoek was Dutch and that is the spelling that scholars use. Several others cited Wikipedia:naming conventions that state that the name most recognizable to the greatest number of English speakers is the correct name in the English wikipedia. Anton is the Anglicized form of Antoni and the article was moved to Anton van Leeuwenhoek with Antoni van Leeuwenhoek being redirected there and a mention of the ''Antoni'' spelling was inserted into the article.''
