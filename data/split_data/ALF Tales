'''''ALF Tales''''' is an animated American series that ran on the NBC television network on Saturdays from August 1988 to December 1989. The show was a spinoff from the series ''ALF: The Animated Series''. The show had characters from that series play various characters from fairy tales. The fairy tale was usually altered for comedic effect in a manner akin to Fractured Fairy Tales.Each story typically spoofs a film genre, such as the "Cinderella" episode done as an Elvis movie. Some episodes featured a "fourth wall" effect where ALF is backstage preparing for the episode, and Rob Cowan would appear drawn as a TV executive (who introduced himself as "Roger Cowan, network executive") to try to brief ALF on how to improve this episode. For instance Cowan once told ALF who was readying for a medieval themed episode that "less than 2% of our audience lives in the Dark Ages".Cast*Paul Fusco - ALF (Gordon Shumway)/Rick Fusterman*Tabitha St. Germain (as Paulina Gillis) - Augie/Rhonda*Peggy Mahon - Flo*Thick Wilson - Larson Petty/Bob*Dan Hennessey - Sloop*Rob Cowan (II) - Skip*Ellen-Ray Hennessy - Stella the Waitress*Noam Zylberman - Curtis (1988)*Michael Fantini - Curtis (1989)EpisodesSeason one* Robin Hood - 9/10/88* Sleeping Beauty - 9/17/88* Cinderella - 9/24/88* Legend of Sleepy Hollow - 10/01/88* Jack and the Beanstalk - 10/8/88* The Aladdin Brothers - 10/15/88* Rapunzel - 10/29/88* Rumplestilskin - 11/12/88* The Princess and the Pea - 11/19/88* John Henry - 12/3/88* The Three Little Piggs - 12/10/88* Alice in Wonderland - 12/17/88* Peter Pan - 1/7/89Season two* Hansel and Gretel - 9/16/89* The Wizard of Oz - 9/23/89* The Elves and the Shoemaker - 9/30/89* The Emperor's New Clothes - 10/14/89* Goldie Locks and the Three Bears - 10/28/89* Little Red Riding Hood - 11/11/89* Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - 12/2/89* King Midas - 12/9/89DVD releaseThe first seven episodes were released on DVD on May 30, 2006 in Region 1 from Lions Gate Home Entertainment in a single-disc release entitled ''ALF and The Beanstalk and Other Classic Fairy Tales''.See also*List of animated spinoffs from prime time showsReferences30emExternal links* ALF Tales
