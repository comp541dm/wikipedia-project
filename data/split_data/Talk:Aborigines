From the original encyclopedia article::The Aborigines' Protection Society was founded in 1838 in England as the result of a royal commission appointed at the instance of Sir T. Fowell Buxton to inquire into the treatment of the indigenous populations of the various British colonies.  The inquiry revealed the gross cruelty and injustice with which the natives had been often treated.  Since its foundation the society has done much to make English colonization a synonym for humane and generous treatment of savage races.Hmmm.  It seems like back in the 1830's at least some people who mattered realised that "the colonies" were treating their native populations unjustly and cruelly.  Wonder how long it's going to take certain Australian politicians to admit it :/
