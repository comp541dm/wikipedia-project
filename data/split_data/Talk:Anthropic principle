Life can evolve in many UniversesThe Anthropic Principle may be a fallacious concept, since "evolutionary life" can evolve in many environments with sufficient complexity to allow (a) formation (b) imperfect time-wise reproduction (c) limits on smoothly time-wise declining resources required for such reproduction (evolution cannot take place if the pace of change is past the "organism"'s limits). In other words, there can be many forms of life that could evolve in many different universes with different physical laws. So long as those universes provide a base for any feasible form of life. For example we can replay the evolution of various conceptual forms of life inside computer systems, using multiple varying environments. Of course, for all that above, we depend an agreed concept to fit the word "life". So any partitioning of physics predicated on the Anthropic Principle and an ill-agreed definition of the concept of life might appear to be weakly based?  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Jjalexand (talk • Special:Contributions/Jjalexand|contribs) 14:06, 12 August 2013 (UTC);;; ;;:Unfortunately there isn't "THE anthropic principle". There are a small number of weak forms of it, and a lot of stronger i.e. more disputable variants. Any discussion of anthropic principles is not fruitful unless it is clear to all parties which principle is being discussed. It is also helpful if the person disputing "the" anthropic principle is not making up their own version.

How would they manifest themselves; if, for instance, energy had a different formulation, could matter come into being?  Is matter a prerequisite for life?
