unit of area measureThe '''acre''' is a unit of land area used in the imperial and US customary systems. It is defined as the area of 1 chain (66 feet) by 1 furlong (660 feet), which is exactly equal to 640 of a square mile, 43,560 square feet, approximately 4,047m2, or about 40% of a hectare.The acre is commonly used in Antigua and Barbuda Australia, American Samoa,  The Bahamas, Belize, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Canada,retrieved January 16, 2016 Dominica, the Falkland Islands, Grenada, Ghana, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, India, Ireland, Jamaica, Montserrat, Myanmar, Pakistan, Samoa, St. Lucia, St. Helena, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Turks and Caicos, the United Kingdom, the United States and the US Virgin Islands.The international symbol of the acre is '''ac'''. The most commonly used acre today is the international acre. In the United States both the international acre and the slightly different US survey acre are in use. The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land. One international acre is defined as exactly 4square metres.An acre was defined in the Middle Ages, being the amount of land that could be ploughed in one day with a yoke of oxen.DescriptionOne acre equals 0.0015625square miles, 4,840square yards, 43,560 square feetNational Institute of Standards and Technology [(n.d.) General Tables of Units of Measurement] or about  (see below). While all modern variants of the acre contain 4,840square yards, there are alternative definitions of a yard, so the exact size of an acre depends on which yard it is based. Originally, an acre was understood as a selion of land sized at forty perches (660ft, or 1furlong) long and four perches (66ft) wide; this may have also been understood as an approximation of the amount of land a yoke of oxen could plough in one day. A square enclosing one acre is approximately 69.57yards, or  on a side. As a unit of measure, an acre has no prescribed shape; any area of 43,560square feet is an acre.Differences between international and US survey acresIn the international yard and pound agreement of 1959 the United States and five countries of the Commonwealth of Nations defined the international yard to be exactly 0.9144metres.National Bureau of Standards. (1959). . Consequently, the international acre is exactly 4square metres.Both the international acre and the US survey acre contain 640 of a square mile or 4,840square yards, but there are alternative definitions of a yard (see survey foot and survey yard), so the exact size of an acre depends on which yard it is based upon. The US survey acre is about 252 square metres; its exact value (15,499,969m2) is based on an inch defined by 1metre = 39.37inches exactly, as established by the Mendenhall Order. Surveyors in the United States use both international and survey feet, and consequently, both varieties of acre.National Geodetic Survey, (January 1991), "[Policy of the National Geodetic Survey Concerning Units of Measure for the State Plane Coordinate System of 1983].Since the difference between the US survey acre and international acre is only about a quarter of the size of an A4 sheet of paper (0.016square metres, 160 square centimetres or 24.8square inches), it is usually not important which one is being discussed. Areas are seldom measured with sufficient accuracy for the different definitions to be detectable.''''. Federick, MD: American Congress on Surveying and Mapping. 2011. [The standard uses "precision" in a sense more typically used for "accuracy"; the stated maximum allowable "precision" (page 3) is 2cm and 50 parts per million. An instrument consistently measuring 2cm short would measure the area of a one international acre square, 63.614907m on a side, as 4044.3square metres, 2.6square metres less than the true value, a far greater discrepancy than the difference between the international and survey acres.]South AsiaIn India, residential plots are measured in cents or decimel, which is one hundredth of an acre, or m2. In Sri Lanka the division of an acre into 160 perches or 4 roods is common.Equivalence to other units of area1 international acre is equal to the following metric units:*4,046.8564224square metres*0.40468564224hectare (A square with 100m sides has an area of 1hectare.)1 United States survey acre is equal to:*4,046.87261square metres  (1 square kilometre is equal to 247.105 acres)*0.404687261hectare1acre (both variants) is equal to the following customary units:*66feet × 660feet (43,560 square feet)*10 square chains (1 chain = 66feet = 22yards = 4 rods = 100 links)*1acre is approximately 208.71feet × 208.71feet (a square)*4,840square yards*43,560 square feet*160 perches.

File:Acre superimposed over football fields.svg|frame|The area of one acre (red) superposed on an American football field (green) and association football (soccer) pitch (blue). To be more exact, one acre is 90.75 percent of a  long by  wide American football field (without the end zones). The full field, including the end zones, covers approximately .For residents of other countries, the acre might be envisaged as approximately 56.68 percent of a  long by  wide association football (soccer) pitch.It may also be remembered as 44,000square feet, less 1%.Historical originThe word ''acre'' is derived from Old English  originally meaning "open field", cognate to west coast Norwegian  and Swedish , German ''Acker'', Dutch ''akker'', Latin ''ager'', Sanskrit ''ajr'', and Greek  (''agros''). In English it was historically spelled ''aker''.The acre was approximately the amount of land tillable by a yoke of oxen in one day.["acre, n.2". OED Online. September 2011. Oxford University Press. (accessed November 15, 2012).] This explains one definition as the area of a rectangle with sides of length one chain and one furlong. A long narrow strip of land is more efficient to plough than a square plot, since the plough does not have to be turned so often. The word "furlong" itself derives from the fact that it is ''one furrow long''.Before the enactment of the metric system, many countries in Europe used their own official acres. These were differently sized in different countries, for instance, the historical French acre was 4,221square metres, whereas in Germany as many variants of "acre" existed as there were German states.Statutory values for the acre were enacted in England, and, subsequently, the United Kingdom, by acts of:*Edward I,*Edward III,*Henry VIII,*George IV and*Queen Victoria – the British Weights and Measures Act of 1878 defined it as containing 4,840square yards.Historically, the size of farms and landed estates in the United Kingdom was usually expressed in acres (or acres, roods, and perches), even if the number of acres was so large that it might conveniently have been expressed in square miles. For example, a certain landowner might have been said to own 32,000acres of land, not 50square miles of land.The acre is related to the square mile, with 640acres making up one square mile. One mile is 5280feet (1760yards). In western Canada and the western United States, divisions of land area were typically based on the square mile, and fractions thereof. If the square mile is divided into quarters, each quarter has a side length of 2 mile (880yards) and is 4 square mile in area, or 160acres. These subunits would typically then again be divided into quarters, with each side being 4 mile long, and being 16 of a square mile in area, or 40acres. In the United States, farmland was typically divided as such, and the phrase "the back 40" would refer to the 40acre parcel to the back of the farm. Most of the Canadian Prairie Provinces and the US midwest are on square mile grids for surveying purposes.Legacy acres* '''Customary acre''' – The customary acre was a measure of roughly similar size to the acre described above, but it was subject to considerable local variation similar to the variation found in carucates, virgates, bovates, nooks, and farundels. However, there were more ancient measures that were also farthingales. These may have been multiples of the customary acre, rather than the statute acre.* '''Builder's acre''' – In US construction and real estate development, an area of 40,000square feet. Used to simplify math and for marketing, it is nearly 10% smaller than a survey acre.* '''Scottish acre''', one of a number of obsolete Scottish units of measurement* '''Irish acre''' = 7,840square yards* '''Cheshire acre''' =  10,240square yardsHolland, Robert.
