Cuarón is the first Latin American director to win an AMPAS Award for Best Directing.Most of his work has been praised by both audiences and critics, and has been nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Original Screenplay for ''Y Tu Mamá También'', and both Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing for ''Children of Men''. For ''Gravity'', Cuarón received several major accolades for his achievement in direction, winning in the respective categories at the Academy Awards, the Golden Globe Awards, the BAFTA Awards and the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film|Directors Guild of America; and in addition winning the BAFTA Award Best British Film and the Academy Award for Best Film Editing (shared with Mark Sanger). He has also been awarded the BAFTA Award for Best Film not in the English Language as one of the producers of ''Pan's Labyrinth'' (2006). In his films, Cuarón is known for his ground-breaking use in the technique of continuous uninterrupted shots.Cuarón's brother Carlos Cuarón|Carlos, as well as his son Jonás Cuarón|Jonás, are also writers and directors and have both acted as co-writers in some of his works. He is also friends with fellow Mexican directors Guillermo del Toro and Alejandro González Iñárritu, collectively known as "The Three Amigos of Cinema."Early lifeAlfonso Cuarón was born in Mexico City, and is the son of Alfredo Cuarón, a nuclear physicist who worked for the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency for many years. He has two brothers, Carlos Cuarón|Carlos, also a filmmaker, and Alfredo, a conservation biologist.Cuarón studied philosophy at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and filmmaking at CUEC (Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos), a school within the same university. There, he met the director Carlos Marcovich and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, and they made what would be his first short film, ''Vengeance Is Mine''.CareerCuarón began working in television in Mexico, first as a technician and then as a director. His television work led to assignments as an assistant director for several Latin American film productions including ''Gaby: A True Story'' and ''Romero'', and in 1991, he landed his first big-screen directorial assignment. On January 12, 2014, Alfonso accepted the Golden Globe Award in the category Best Director for Gravity (The 71st Annual Golden Globe Awards, 2014). He also won two Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Directing.''Sólo con tu pareja''''Sólo con tu pareja'' was a sex comedy about a womanizing businessman (played by Daniel Giménez Cacho) who, after having sex with an attractive nurse, is fooled into believing he's contracted AIDS. In addition to writing, producing and directing, Cuarón co-edited the film with Luis Patlán. It is somewhat unusual for directors to be credited co-editors, although the Coen Brothers and Robert Rodriguez have both directed and edited nearly all of their films. Cuarón continued this close involvement in editing on several of his later films.The film, which also starred cabaret singer Astrid Hadad and model/actress Claudia Ramírez (with whom Cuarón was linked between 1989 and 1993), was a big hit in Mexico. After this success, director Sydney Pollack hired Cuarón to direct an episode of ''Fallen Angels'', a series of neo-noir stories produced for the Showtime premium cable network in 1993; other directors who worked on the series included Steven Soderbergh, Jonathan Kaplan, Peter Bogdanovich and Tom Hanks.International successIn 1995, Cuarón released his first feature film produced in the United States, ''A Little Princess'', an adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett's classic novel. Cuarón's next feature was also a literary adaptation, a modernized version of Charles Dickens's ''Great Expectations'' starring Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow and Robert De Niro.Cuarón's next project found him returning to Mexico with a Spanish-speaking cast to film ''Y Tu Mamá También'', starring Gael García Bernal, Diego Luna and Maribel Verdú. It was a provocative and controversial road comedy about two sexually obsessed teenagers who take an extended road trip with an attractive married woman that is much older than them. The film's open portrayal of sexuality and frequent rude humor, as well as the politically and socially relevant asides, made the film an international hit and a major success with critics. Cuarón shared an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay with co-writer and brother Carlos Cuarón.In 2003, Cuarón directed the third film in the successful ''Harry Potter'' series, ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban''. Cuarón faced criticism from some of the more purist ''Harry Potter'' fans for his approach to the film. At the time of the movie's release, however, author J. K. Rowling, who had seen and loved Cuarón's film ''Y Tu Mamá También'', said that it was her personal favorite from the series so far.[J.K. Rowling] Accessed January 17, 2007. Critically, the film was also better received than the first two installments, with some critics remarking that it was the first ''Harry Potter'' film to truly capture the essence of the novels.[RT: Prisoner of Azkaban] It remained as the most critically acclaimed film of the ''Harry Potter'' film franchise until the release of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2''.Cuarón's feature ''Children of Men'', an adaptation of the P. D. James novel starring Clive Owen, Julianne Moore and Michael Caine, received wide critical acclaim, including three Academy Award nominations. Cuarón himself received two nominations for his work on the film in Best Film Editing (with Alex Rodríguez) and Best Adapted Screenplay (with several collaborators).He created the production and distribution company Esperanto Filmoj (''Esperanto Films'', named because of his support for the international language Esperanto by Sam Green with Cuarón.), which has credits in the films ''Duck Season'', ''Pan's Labyrinth'', and ''Gravity''.Cuarón also directed the controversial public service announcement "I Am Autism" for Autism Speaks that was sharply criticized by disability rights groups for its negative portrayal of autism.In 2010, Cuarón began to develop the film ''Gravity'', a drama set in space. He was joined by producer David Heyman, with whom Cuarón worked on ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban''.
