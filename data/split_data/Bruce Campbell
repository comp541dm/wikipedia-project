After meeting Sam Raimi in Wylie E. Groves High School, the two became very good friends and started making movies together. Campbell would go on to attend Western Michigan University while he continued to work on his acting career. Campbell and Raimi collaborated on a 30-minute Super 8 version of the first ''Evil Dead'' film, titled ''Within the Woods'', which was initially used to attract investors.Major film rolesA few years later, Campbell and Raimi got together with family and friends and began work on ''The Evil Dead''. Campbell starred and worked behind the camera, receiving a "co-executive producer" credit. Raimi wrote, directed and edited, while fellow Michigander Rob Tapert was producer. Following an endorsement by horror writer Stephen King, the film slowly began to receive distribution. Four years following its original release, it became the number one movie in the UK. It then received distribution in the U.S., spawning two sequels: ''Evil Dead II'' and ''Army of Darkness''. Campbell's role as Ashley J. "Ash" Williams has since become iconic. The first two films in the series are considered horror classics and are credited with spawning the "horror comedy" genre.He was also drawn in the Marvel Zombie comics as his character, Ash Williams. He is featured in five comics, all in the series ''Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness''. In the comics he fights alongside the Marvel heroes against the heroes and people who have turned into zombies (deadites) while in search of the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead).He has appeared in many of Raimi's films outside of the ''Evil Dead'' series, notably cameo roles in the ''Spider-Man'' film series.
