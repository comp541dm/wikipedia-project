How to enter the BIOSWe should have a section listing different BIOS'es. I know it's very different from computer to computer, but if we start a list, i'm sure it'll grow pretty fast. It would be very handy to alot of people. Maybe  will help with the initial list.:Yeah, this would also help on the [sysadmin wiki]. Cause being a sysadmin, you sometimes need to tell the user over the phone how to enter the BIOS and it ain't easy when you're not sure if it's F2, DEL or ESC this time.::What you're referring to is the BIOS setup program, not the BIOS itself.  As is stated by the article, BIOS is a program that is initially run by IBM PC compatibles. -- mattb @ 2006-12-01T13:28ZTop HAT an alternative to Dual Bios.I have top hat and was looking for some info.
