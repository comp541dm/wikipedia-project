Sony re-releases This is BAD -- The Legacy EditionOn April 13, Sony re-released the first BAD album as a two-disc CD -- where should this go in the article? --Spiff666 (talk) 22:21, 20 April 2010 (UTC)They WHAT?They WHAT?  The first paragraph currently ends::''Though ostensibly a group, they''::Sorry about that chief! I wanted to point out that B.A.D.'s membership is very fluid except for Mick Jones and double-clutched about where to put that. It appears later in the article, but then I forgot to go back and remove the incomplete sentence at the front. -- User:Paul DryeDigital samplingI removed:'', is generally recognized as the first album by a major recording artist to include digital sampling techniques. ''. There are several problems with this - first, it is unattributed - generally recognised by whom? second, it can't be true - for example Peter Gabriel's 1982 album included "Shock the Monkey", which featured a Fairlight CMI, which really is "generally recognised" as the first digital sampling synth. However even that isn't completely agreed - the CMI article also mentions Kate Bush and others. Whichever is the case, 1982 is well before November 1985, which is when the BAD album was released.

The original sentence was an opinion.Sound clips from films/tv etcNearly every song has a short sample of a piece of audio from a film/tv/etc. I want to include it this information but I don't know where.

It would be too much on the artist page.
