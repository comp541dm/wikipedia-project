It exists in various crystalline forms that are isoelectronic to a similarly structured carbon lattice. The hexagonal form corresponding to graphite is the most stable and soft among BN polymorphs, and is therefore used as a lubricant and an additive to cosmetic products. The cubic (sphalerite structure) variety analogous to diamond is called c-BN; it is softer than diamond, but its thermal and chemical stability is superior. The rare wurtzite BN modification is similar to lonsdaleite and may even be harder than the cubic form.Because of excellent thermal and chemical stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used as parts of high-temperature equipment. Boron nitride has potential use in nanotechnology. Nanotubes of BN can be produced that have a structure similar to that of carbon nanotubes, i.e. graphene (or BN) sheets rolled on themselves, but the properties are very different.StructureBoron nitride has been produced in amorphous (a-BN) and crystalline forms. The most stable crystalline form is the hexagonal one, also called h-BN, α-BN, or g-BN (graphitic BN). Hexagonal boron nitride (point group = D6h; space group = P63/mmc) has a layered structure similar to graphite. Within each layer, boron and nitrogen atoms are bound by strong covalent bonds, whereas the layers are held together by weak van der Waals forces. The interlayer "registry" of these sheets differs, however, from the pattern seen for graphite, because the atoms are eclipsed, with boron atoms lying over and above nitrogen atoms. This registry reflects the polarity of the B-N bonds. Still, h-BN and graphite are very close neighbors and even the BC6N hybrids have been synthesized where carbon substitutes for some B and N atoms.As diamond is less stable than graphite, cubic BN is less stable than h-BN, but the conversion rate between those forms is negligible at room temperature (again like diamond). The cubic form has the sphalerite crystal structure, the same as that of diamond, and is also called β-BN or c-BN. The wurtzite BN form (w-BN; point group = C6v; space group = P63mc) has the same structure as lonsdaleite, a rare hexagonal polymorph of carbon.  In both c-BN and w-BN, the boron and nitrogen atoms are grouped into tetrahedra, but the angles between neighboring tetrahedra differ between the two.{| style="margin:auto;"  class="wikitable"|250px;/center;||200px;/center;||200px;/center;|-|α-BN, hexagonal;/center;||β-BN, sphalerite structure;/center;||BN, wurtzite structure;/center;|}PropertiesPhysical{| class="wikitable" style="margin:0;"|+ Properties of amorphous and crystalline BN, graphite and diamond.Some properties of h-BN and graphite differ within the basal planes (∥) and perpendicular to them (⟂);!Material!a-BN!h-BN!c-BN!w-BN!graphite!diamond|-!Density (g/cm3)| 2.28|~2.1| 3.45| 3.49|~2.1| 3.515|-!Knoop hardness (GPa)| 10|| 45| 34|| 100|-!Bulk modulus (GPa)| 100| 36.5| 400| 400| 34| 440|-!Thermal conductivity (W/(m·K))| 3| 600 ∥, 30 ⟂| 740|| 200–2000 ∥, 2–800 ⟂| 600–2000|-!Thermal expansion (10−6/°C)|| −2.7 ∥, 38 ⟂| 1.2| 2.7| −1.5 ∥, 25 ⟂| 0.8|-!Bandgap (eV)| 5.05| 5.2| 6.4| 4.5–5.5| 0| 5.5|-!Refractive index| 1.7| 1.8| 2.1| 2.05|| 2.4|-!Magnetic susceptibility (µemu/g)|| −0.48 ∥, −17.3 ⟂||| −0.2...−2.7 ∥, −20...−28 ⟂| −1.6|}''Sources: amorphous BN, crystalline BN,ioffegraphite, diamond''.The partly ionic structure of BN layers in h-BN reduces covalency and electrical conductivity, whereas the interlayer interaction increases resulting in higher hardness of h-BN relative to graphite. The reduced electron-delocalization in hexagonal-BN is also indicated by its absence of color and a large band gap. Very different bonding – strong covalent within the basal planes (planes where boron and nitrogen atoms are covalently bonded) and weak between them – causes high anisotropy of most properties of h-BN.For example, the hardness, electrical and thermal conductivity are much higher within the planes than perpendicular to them. On the contrary, the properties of c-BN and w-BN are more homogeneous and isotropic.Those materials are extremely hard, with the hardness of bulk c-BN being slightly smaller and w-BN even higher than that of diamond. Polycrystalline c-BN with grain sizes on the order of 10nm is also reported to have Vickers hardness comparable or higher than diamond.Because of much better stability to heat and transition metals, c-BN surpasses diamond in mechanical applications, such as machining steel. The thermal conductivity of BN is among the highest of all electric insulators (see table).Boron nitride can be doped p-type with beryllium and n-type with boron, sulfur, silicon or if co-doped with carbon and nitrogen.BNBoth hexagonal and cubic BN are wide-gap semiconductors with a band-gap energy corresponding to the UV region. If voltage is applied to h-BN or c-BN, then it emits UV light in the range 215–250nm and therefore can potentially be used as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or lasers.Little is known on melting behavior of boron nitride. It sublimates at 2973°C at normal pressure releasing nitrogen gas and boron, but melts at elevated pressure.Thermal stabilityHexagonal and cubic (and probably w-BN) BN show remarkable chemical and thermal stabilities. For example, h-BN is stable to decomposition at temperatures up to 1000°C in air, 1400°C in vacuum, and 2800°C in an inert atmosphere. The reactivity of h-BN and c-BN is relatively similar, and the data for c-BN are summarized in the table below.{| class="wikitable" style="margin:10px;"|+ Reactivity of c-BN with solidsBN!Solid!Ambient!Action!Threshold T (°C)|-| Mo| vacuum| reaction| 1360|-| Ni| vacuum|wetting| 1360|-| Fe, Ni, Co| argon| react| 1400–1500|-| Al| vacuum| wetting and reaction| 1050|-| Si| vacuum| wetting| 1500|-| Cu, Ag, Au, Ga, In, Ge, Sn| vacuum| no wetting| 1100|-| B|| no wetting| 2200|-| Al2O3 + B2O3| vacuum| no reaction| 1360|}Thermal stability of c-BN can be summarized as follows:BN*In air or oxygen: B2O3 protective layer prevents further oxidation to ~1300°C; no conversion to hexagonal form at 1400°C.*In nitrogen: some conversion to h-BN at 1525°C after 12h.*In vacuum (): conversion to h-BN at 1550–1600°C.Chemical stabilityBoron nitride is insoluble in the usual acids, but is soluble in alkaline molten salts and nitrides, such as LiOH, KOH, NaOH-Sodium carbonate|Na2CO3, Sodium nitrate|NaNO3, Lithium nitride|Li3N, Magnesium nitride|Mg3N2, Strontium nitride|Sr3N2, Barium nitride|Ba3N2 or Lithium boron nitride|Li3BN2, which are therefore used to etch BN.BNThermal conductivityThe theoretical thermal conductivity of hexagonal Boron nitride nanoribbons (BNNRs) can approach 1700–2000 W/(m·K), which has the same order of magnitude as the experimental measured value for graphene, and can be comparable to the theoretical calculations for graphene nanoribbons. Moreover, the thermal transport in the BNNRs is anisotropic. The thermal conductivity of zigzag-edged BNNRs is about 20% larger than that of armchair-edged nanoribbons at room temperature.Natural occurrenceIn 2009, a naturally occurring boron nitride mineral (proposed name qingsongite) was reported in Tibet. The substance was found in dispersed micron-sized inclusions of qingsongite (c-BN) in chromium-rich rocks in Tibet. In 2013, the International Mineralogical Association affirmed the mineral and the name.SynthesisPreparation and reactivity of hexagonal BNBoron nitride is produced synthetically. Hexagonal boron nitride is obtained by the reacting boron trioxide (B2O3) or boric acid (B(OH)3) with ammonia (NH3) or urea (CO(NH2)2) in a nitrogen atmosphere::B2O3 + 2 NH3 → 2 BN + 3 H2O (T = 900°C):B(OH)3 + NH3 → BN + 3 H2O (T = 900°C):B2O3 + CO(NH2)2 → 2 BN + CO2 + 2 H2O (T ; 1000°C):B2O3 + 3 CaB6 + 10 N2 → 20 BN + 3 CaO (T ; 1500°C)The resulting disordered (amorphous) boron nitride contains 92–95% BN and 5–8% B2O3. The remaining B2O3 can be evaporated in a second step at temperatures  in order to achieve BN concentration ;98%. Such annealing also crystallizes BN, the size of the crystallites increasing with the annealing temperature.dkgh-BN parts can be fabricated inexpensively by hot-pressing with subsequent machining. The parts are made from boron nitride powders adding boron oxide for better compressibility. Thin films of boron nitride can be obtained by chemical vapor deposition from boron trichloride and nitrogen precursors. Combustion of boron powder in nitrogen plasma at 5500°C yields ultrafine boron nitride used for lubricants and toners.Boron nitride reacts with iodine fluoride in trichlorofluoromethane at −30°C to produce an extremely sensitive contact explosive, NI3, in low yield.Boron nitride reacts with nitrides of alkali metals and lanthanides to form nitridoborate compounds. For example::Li3N + BN → Li3BN2Intercalation of hexagonal BNGraphite intercalation compoundImage:BN8Kstructure.jpg|150px|thumb|Structure of hexagonal boron nitride intercalated with potassium (B4N4K)Similar to graphite, various molecules, such as NH3 or alkali metals, can be intercalated into hexagonal boron nitride, that is inserted between its layers. Both experiment and theory suggest the intercalation is much more difficult for BN than for graphite.Preparation of cubic BNSynthesis of c-BN uses same methods as that of diamond: Cubic boron nitride is produced by treating hexagonal boron nitride at high pressure and temperature, much as synthetic diamond is produced from graphite. Direct conversion of hexagonal boron nitride to the cubic form has been observed at pressures between 5 and 18GPa and temperatures between 1730 and 3230°C, that is similar parameters as for direct graphite-diamond conversion. The addition of a small amount of boron oxide can lower the required pressure to 4–7GPa and temperature to 1500°C. As in diamond synthesis, to further reduce the conversion pressures and temperatures, a catalyst is added, such as lithium, potassium, or magnesium, their nitrides, their fluoronitrides, water with ammonium compounds, or hydrazine. Other industrial synthesis methods, again borrowed from diamond growth, use crystal growth in a temperature gradient, or explosive shock wave. The shock wave method is used to produce material called heterodiamond, a superhard compound of boron, carbon, and nitrogen.Low-pressure deposition of thin films of cubic boron nitride is possible. As in diamond growth, the major problem is to suppress the growth of hexagonal phases (h-BN or graphite, respectively). Whereas in diamond growth this is achieved by adding hydrogen gas, boron trifluoride is used for c-BN. Ion beam deposition, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, pulsed laser deposition, reactive sputtering, and other physical vapor deposition methods are used as well.cvdPreparation of wurtzite BNWurtzite BN can be obtained via static high-pressure or dynamic shock methods. The limits of its stability are not well defined. Both c-BN and w-BN are formed by compressing h-BN, but formation of w-BN occurs at much lower temperatures close to 1700°C.velProduction statisticsWhereas the production and consumption figures for the raw materials used for BN synthesis, namely boric acid and boron trioxide, are well known (see boron), the corresponding numbers for the boron nitride are not listed in statistical reports. An estimate for the 1999 world production is 300 to 350 metric tons. The major producers and consumers of BN are located in the United States, Japan, China and Germany. In 2000, prices varied from about $75/kg to $120/kg for standard industrial-quality h-BN and were about up to $200–$400/kg for high purity BN grades.prodApplicationsHexagonal BNCeramic BN crucibleHexagonal BN (h-BN) is the most widely used polymorph. It is a good lubricant at both low and high temperatures (up to 900°C, even in an oxidizing atmosphere). h-BN lubricant is particularly useful when the electrical conductivity or chemical reactivity of graphite (alternative lubricant) would be problematic. Another advantage of h-BN over graphite is that its lubricity does not require water or gas molecules trapped between the layers. Therefore, h-BN lubricants can be used even in vacuum, e.g. in space applications. The lubricating properties of fine-grained h-BN are used in cosmetics, paints, dental cements, and pencil leads.Hexagonal BN was first used in cosmetics around 1940 in Japan. However, because of its high price, h-BN was soon abandoned for this application. Its use was revitalized in the late 1990s with the optimization h-BN production processes, and currently h-BN is used by nearly all leading producers of cosmetic products for foundations, make-up, eye shadows, blushers, kohl pencils, lipsticks and other skincare products.dkgBecause of its excellent thermal and chemical stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used as parts of high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. bearings and in steelmaking.dkgPlastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. Due to its excellent dielectric and thermal properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows, and as a structural material for seals.Hexagonal BN is used in xerographic process and laser printers as a charge leakage barrier layer of the photo drum. In the automotive industry, h-BN mixed with a binder (boron oxide) is used for sealing oxygen sensors, which provide feedback for adjusting fuel flow. The binder utilizes the unique temperature stability and insulating properties of h-BN.dkgParts can be made of h-BN by hot pressing. Momentive Performance Materials  produces four grades of h-BN shapes. Grade HBN, with boron oxide binder, usable to 550–850°C in oxidizing atmosphere and up to 1600°C in vacuum, but due to the boron oxide content is sensitive to water. Grade HBR uses calcium borate binder and is usable at 1600°C. Grades HBC and HBT use no binder and can be used to 3000°C.Two-dimensional hBN (monolayer thick sheets) has been shown to be an excellent proton conductor, yielding unexpectedly high proton transport rates.  This high proton transport rate, combined with the high electrical resistance of h-BN, may lead to important advances in research such as fuel cells and water electrolysis.h-BN has been used since the mid-2000s as a bullet and bore lubricant in precision target rifle applications as an alternative to molybdenum disulfide coating, commonly referred to as "moly". It is claimed to increase effective barrel life, increase intervals between bore cleaning, and decrease the deviation in point of impact between clean bore first shots and subsequent shots.Cubic boron nitrideCubic boron nitride (CBN or c-BN) is widely used as an abrasive. Its usefulness arises from its insolubility in iron, nickel, and related alloys at high temperatures, whereas diamond is soluble in these metals to give carbides. Polycrystalline c-BN (PCBN) abrasives are therefore used for machining steel, whereas diamond abrasives are preferred for aluminum alloys, ceramics, and stone. When in contact with oxygen at high temperatures, BN forms a passivation layer of boron oxide. Boron nitride binds well with metals, due to formation of interlayers of metal borides or nitrides. Materials with cubic boron nitride crystals are often used in the tool bits of cutting tools. For grinding applications, softer binders, e.g. resin, porous ceramics, and soft metals, are used. Ceramic binders can be used as well. Commercial products are known under names "Borazon" (by Diamond Innovations), and "Elbor" or "Cubonite" (by Russian vendors). Similar to diamond, the combination in c-BN of highest thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity is ideal for heat spreaders. Contrary to diamond, large c-BN pellets can be produced in a simple process (called sintering) of annealing c-BN powders in nitrogen flow at temperatures slightly below the BN decomposition temperature. This ability of c-BN and h-BN powders to fuse allows cheap production of large BN parts.b1As cubic boron nitride consists of light atoms and is very robust chemically and mechanically, it is one of the popular materials for X-ray membranes: low mass results in small X-ray absorption, and good mechanical properties allow usage of thin membranes, thus further reducing the absorption.Amorphous boron nitrideLayers of amorphous boron nitride (a-BN) are used in some semiconductor devices, e.g. MISFETs. They can be prepared by chemical decomposition of trichloroborazine with caesium, or by thermal chemical vapor deposition methods. Thermal CVD can be also used for deposition of h-BN layers, or at high temperatures, c-BN.Other forms of boron nitrideBoron nitride nanomeshPerspective view of nanomesh (structure ends at the back of the figure)Image:STMnm-2.JPG|thumb|left|BN nanomesh observed by scanning tunneling microscope. The center of each ring corresponds to the center of the poresNanomeshBoron nitride nanomesh is a nanostructured two-dimensional material. It consists of a single BN layer, which forms by self-assembly a highly regular mesh after high-temperature exposure of a clean rhodium or ruthenium surface to borazine under ultra-high vacuum. The nanomesh looks like an assembly of hexagonal pores. The distance between 2 pore centers is 3.2nm and the pore diameter is ~2nm.  Other terms for this material are boronitrene or white graphene.. physik.uni-saarland.deThe boron nitride nanomesh is not only stable to decomposition under vacuum,"corso04"air and some liquids, but also up to temperatures of 800°C."corso04"In addition, it shows the extraordinary ability to trap molecules"berner07"and metallic clusters"goriachko07"which have similar sizes to the nanomesh pores, forming a well-ordered array. These characteristics promise interesting applications of the nanomesh in areas like catalysis, surface functionalisation, spintronics, quantum computing and data storage media like hard drives.Boron nitride nanotubesBoron nitride nanotubeBoron nitride nanotubes were predicted in 1994 and experimentally discovered in 1995. They can be imagined as a rolled up sheet of boron nitride. Structurally, it is a close analog of the carbon nanotube, namely a long cylinder with diameter of several to hundred nanometers and length of many micrometers, except carbon atoms are alternately substituted by nitrogen and boron atoms. However, the properties of BN nanotubes are very different: whereas carbon nanotubes can be metallic or semiconducting depending on the rolling direction and radius, a BN nanotube is an electrical insulator with a bandgap of ~5.5 eV, basically independent of tube chirality and morphology. In addition, a layered BN structure is much more thermally and chemically stable than a graphitic carbon structure.Composites containing BNAddition of boron nitride to silicon nitride ceramics improves the thermal shock resistance of the resulting material. For the same purpose, BN is added also to silicon nitride-alumina and titanium nitride-alumina ceramics. Other materials being reinforced with BN include alumina and zirconia, borosilicate glasses, glass ceramics, enamels, and composite ceramics with titanium boride-boron nitride, titanium boride-aluminium nitride-boron nitride, and silicon carbide-boron nitride composition.Health issuesBoron nitride (along with Si3N4, NbN, and BNC) is reported to show weak fibrogenic activity and cause pneumoconiosis. The maximum concentration recommended for nitrides of nonmetals is 10mg/m3 for BN and 4 for AlN or ZrN.BNSee also3*Beta carbon nitride*Boron suboxide*Superhard materials*Wide bandgap semiconductors*GrapheneNotes and references2External links***[Materials Safety Data Sheet] at University of Oxford
