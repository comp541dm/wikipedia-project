Over two decades, the focus of the school gradually shifted toward post-secondary programs. In 1968, UBBTS became a Bible and junior Christian liberal arts college, and in 1970 the name was changed to '''Atlantic Baptist College''' (ABC). A sustained campaign to expand the school's faculty and improve the level of education resulted in ABC being able to grant full Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1983. Its campus at this time was located along the Salisbury Road, west of Moncton's central business district.The institution moved to a new campus constructed on the Gorge Road, north of the central business district, in 1996. The name was also changed to '''Atlantic Baptist University''', a reflection of expanded student enrollment and academic accreditation. In 2003, the ABU sports teams adopted the name ''The Blue Tide''. The institution was the first, and thus far only, English university in Moncton. The ''Atlantic Baptist University Act'' was passed by the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in 2008.On August 21, 2009 it was announced that the institution had changed its name to '''Crandall University''' in honour of Rev. Joseph Crandall, a pioneering Baptist minister in the maritime region. In conjunction with the University name change, Crandall Athletics took on a new identity as "The Crandall Chargers."In 2012, Crandall University came under public scrutiny for receiving municipal funds regardless of having an anti-gay hiring policy.Programs*Bachelor of Business Administration*Bachelor of Education**Technical Education*Bachelor of Arts**Biblical Studies**Communications**English**History**Interdisciplinary Studies**Modern Languages***French**Organizational Management**Psychology**Religious Studies**Sociology*Bachelor of Science**Biology*Master of Education*Master of Organizational ManagementNotable alumni*Ralph Richardson, first chancellor of the university*Ken LeBlanc, EntrepreneurControversyThe University has been criticized for accepting public money (municipal, provincial and federal) to fund programs and expansions to the campus but maintaining a hiring policy which would prohibit gay faculty."thestar.com"A year after the controversy erupted, the University opted to not apply for $150,000 in public funding that it had received annually in order to avoid changing its hiring policy.See also* List of schools in Moncton* Higher education in New Brunswick* List of universities and colleges in New BrunswickChristianityReferencesExternal links*[Crandall University Homepage]*[Crandall University Athletics Homepage]
