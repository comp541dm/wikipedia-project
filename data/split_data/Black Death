Black Death (disambiguation)300px|Spread of the Black Death in Europe (1346–53)The '''Black Death''' was one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 75 to 200 million people and peaking in Europe in the years 1346–53."ABC/Reuters"; Although there were several competing theories as to the etiology of the Black Death, analysis of DNA from victims in northern and southern Europe published in 2010 and 2011 indicates that the pathogen responsible was the ''Yersinia pestis'' bacterium, probably causing several forms of plague.The Black Death is thought to have originated in the arid plains of Central Asia, where it then travelled along the Silk Road, reaching Crimea by 1343. From there, it was most likely carried by Oriental rat fleas living on the black rats that were regular passengers on merchant ships. Spreading throughout the Mediterranean and Europe, the Black Death is estimated to have killed 30–60% of Europe's total population. In total, the plague reduced the world population from an estimated 450million down to 350–375 million in the 14th century. The world population as a whole did not recover to pre-plague levels until the 17th century. The plague recurred occasionally in Europe until the 19th century.The plague created a series of religious, social, and economic upheavals, which had profound effects on the course of European history.ChronologyOrigins of the diseaseBlack Death migrationThe plague disease, caused by ''Yersinia pestis'', is enzootic (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, including marmots, in various areas including Central Asia, Kurdistan, Western Asia, Northern India and Uganda. Nestorian graves dating to 1338–39 near Lake Issyk Kul in Kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic, from which it could easily have spread to China and India. In October 2010, medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in China.In China, the 13th century Mongol conquest caused a decline in farming and trading. However, economic recovery had been observed at the beginning of the 14thcentury. In the 1330s a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine, starting in 1331, with a deadly plague arriving soon after.The Cambridge History of China: Alien regimes and border states, 907–1368, p.585 Epidemics that may have included plague killed an estimated 25million Chinese and other Asians during the 15years before it reached Constantinople in 1347.The disease may have travelled along the Silk Road with Mongol armies and traders or it could have come via ship.By the end of 1346, reports of plague had reached the seaports of Europe: "India was depopulated, Tartary, Mesopotamia, Syria, Armenia were covered with dead bodies". cited by Ziegler, p. 15.Plague was reportedly first introduced to Europe via Genoese traders at the port city of Kaffa in the Crimea in 1347. After a protracted siege, during which the Mongol army under Jani Beg was suffering from the disease, the army catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls of Kaffa to infect the inhabitants. The Genoese traders fled, taking the plague by ship into Sicily and the south of Europe, whence it spread north. Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate, it is clear that several existing conditions such as war, famine, and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death.European outbreakThere appear to have been several introductions into Europe. The plague reached Sicily in October 1347, carried by twelve Genoese galleys,Michael of Piazza (Platiensis) ''Bibliotheca scriptorum qui res in Sicilia gestas retulere'' Vol 1, p. 562, cited in Ziegler, 1998, p. 40. and rapidly spread all over the island. Galleys from Kaffa reached Genoa and Venice in January 1348, but it was the outbreak in Pisa a few weeks later that was the entry point to northern Italy. Towards the end of January, one of the galleys expelled from Italy arrived in Marseille.From Italy, the disease spread northwest across Europe, striking France, Spain, Portugal and England by June 1348, then turned and spread east through Germany and Scandinavia from 1348 to 1350. It was introduced in Norway in 1349 when a ship landed at Askøy, then spread to Bjørgvin (modern Bergen) and Iceland.Finally it spread to northwestern Russia in 1351. The plague was somewhat less common in parts of Europe that had smaller trade relations with their neighbours, including the Kingdom of Poland, the majority of the Basque Country, isolated parts of Belgium and the Netherlands, and isolated alpine villages throughout the continent.Welford, Mark, and Brian H. Bossak. "Revisiting the Medieval Black Death of 1347–1351: Spatiotemporal Dynamics Suggestive of an Alternate Causation." Geography Compass 4.6 (2010): 561-575Modern researchers do not think that the plague ever became endemic in Europe or its rat population. The disease repeatedly wiped out the rodent carriers so that the fleas died out until a new outbreak from Central Asia repeated the process. The outbreaks have been shown to occur roughly 15 years after a warmer and wetter period in areas where plague is endemic in other species such as gerbils.Middle Eastern outbreakThe plague struck various countries in the Middle East during the pandemic, leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures. As it spread to western Europe, the disease entered the region from southern Russia also. By autumn 1347, the plague reached Alexandria in Egypt, probably through the port's trade with Constantinople, and ports on the Black Sea. During 1347, the disease travelled eastward to Gaza, and north along the eastern coast to cities in Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, including Ashkelon, Acre, Jerusalem, Sidon, Damascus, Homs, and Aleppo. In 1348–49, the disease reached Antioch. The city's residents fled to the north, most of them dying during the journey, but the infection had been spread to the people of Asia Minor.Mecca became infected in 1349. During the same year, records show the city of Mawsil (Mosul) suffered a massive epidemic, and the city of Baghdad experienced a second round of the disease. In 1351 Yemen experienced an outbreak of the plague, coinciding with the return of King Mujahid of Yemen from imprisonment in Cairo. His party may have brought the disease with them from Egypt.SymptomsFile:Acral gangrene due to plague.jpg|thumb|225px|A hand showing how acral gangrene of the fingers due to bubonic plague causes the skin and flesh to die and turn black An inguinal bubo on the upper thigh of a person infected with bubonic plague. Swollen lymph glands (''buboes'') often occur in the neck, armpit and groin (''inguinal'') regions of plague victimsContemporary accounts of the plague are often varied or imprecise. The most commonly noted symptom was the appearance of buboes (or gavocciolos) in the groin, the neck and armpits, which oozed pus and bled when opened.Byrne2004pp21-9Boccaccio's description is graphic:The only medical detail that is questionable is the infallibility of approaching death, as if the bubo discharges, recovery is possible.This was followed by acute fever and vomiting of blood. Most victims died two to seven days after initial infection. Freckle-like spots and rashes, which could have been caused by flea-bites, were identified as another potential sign of the plague.Some accounts, like that of Louis Heyligen, a musician in Avignon who died of the plague in 1348, noted a distinct form of the disease that infected the lungs and led to respiratory problemsByrne2004pp21-9and is identified with pneumonic plague.NamingThe 12th-century  French physician Gilles de Corbeil in his ''De signis et sinthomatibus egritudinum'' (On the signs and symptoms of diseases) used the phrase ''atra mors'' to refer to a pestilential fever (''febris pestilentialis'') See:  Stephen d'Irsay (May 1926) "Notes to the origin of the expression:  atra mors," ''Isis'', '''8''' (2) :  328-332.Writers contemporary to the plague referred to the event as the "Great Mortality",As seen in John of Fordun's ''Scotichronicon'', where he writes "there was a great pestilence and mortality of men".  or the "Great Plague".Bennet;Hollister2006;J. M. Bennett and C. W. Hollister, ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006), p. 326. The phrase "Black Death" (''mors nigra'') was used in 1350 by Simon de Covino (or Couvin), a Belgian astronomer, who wrote the poem "''De judicio Solis in convivio Saturni''" (On the judgment of the Sun at a feast of Saturn) in which he attributed the plague to a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn.*  On page 22 of the manuscript in [Gallica], Simon mentions the phrase "''mors nigra''" (Black Death):  "''Cum rex finisset oracula judiciorum / Mors nigra surrexit, et gentes reddidit illi'';" (When the king ended the oracles of judgment / Black Death arose, and the nations surrendered to him;).*  A more legible copy of the poem appears in:  Emile Littré (1841)   (Work concerning the plague of 1348, composed by a contemporary), ''Bibliothèque de l'école des chartes'', '''2''' (2) :  201-243; see especially page 228.*  See also:  Joseph Patrick Byrne, ''The Black Death'' (Westport, Connecticut:  Greenwood Press, 2004),Gasquet (1908) claimed that the Latin name ''atra mors'' (Black Death) for the 14th-century epidemic first appeared in modern times in 1631 in a book on Danish history by J.I. Pontanus:  "''Vulgo ; ab effectu ''atram mortem'' vocatibant.'' ("Commonly and from its effects, they called it the black death").Francis Aidan Gasquet, ''The Black Death of 1348 and 1349'', 2nd ed. (London, England:  George Bell and Sons, 1908),Johan Isaksson Pontanus, ''Rerum Danicarum Historia'' ... (Amsterdam (Netherlands):  Johann Jansson, 1631),  The  name spread through Scandinavia and then Germany, gradually becoming attached to the mid 14th-century epidemic as a proper name.The German physician Justus Hecker (1795–1850) cited the phrase in Icelandic (''Svartur Daudi''), Danish (''den sorte Dod''), etc.  See:  J.F.C. Hecker, ''Der schwarze Tod im vierzehnten Jahrhundert'' [The Black Death in the Fourteenth Century] (Berlin, (Germany):  Friedr. Aug. Herbig, 1832),   In England, it was not until 1823 that the medieval epidemic was first called the Black Death.The name "Black Death" first appeared in English in:*  "Mrs. Markham" (pen name of Elizabeth Penrose (née Cartwright)), ''A History of England'' ... (Edinburgh, Scotland:  Archibald Constable, 1823).  In the 1829 edition, the relevant text appeared on pages 249-250, where, about the English king Edward III, she wrote:  "Edward's successes in France were interrupted during the next six years by a most terrible pestilence — so terrible as to be called the black death — which raged throughout Europe, and proved a greater scourge to the people than even the calamities of war."  (For further information about this book and Mrs. Penrose, see:  Wikisource and ).*  See also:  J. L. Bolton, "Looking for ''Yersinia pestis'':  Scientists, Historians and the Black Death" in:  Linda Clark and Carole Rawcliffe, ed.s, ''The Fifteenth Century XII: Society in an Age of Plague'' (Woodbridge, England:  Boydell Press, 2013),The name "Black Death" was spread more widely when in 1833, Benjamin Guy Babington published an English translation of J.F.C. Hecker's book ''Der schwarze Tod im vierzehnten Jahrhundert'' as:  J.F.C. Hecker with Benjamin Guy Babington, trans., ''The Black Death in the Fourteenth Century'' (London, England:  A. Schloss, 1833).CausesFile:Yersinia pestis fluorescent.jpeg|thumb|''Yersinia pestis'' (200x magnification). The bacterium which causes bubonic plague.Medical knowledge had stagnated during the Middle Ages. The most authoritative account at the time came from the medical faculty in Paris in a report to the king of France that blamed the heavens, in the form of a conjunction of three planets in 1345 that caused a "great pestilence in the air". This report became the first and most widely circulated of a series of plague tracts that sought to give advice to sufferers. That the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely accepted theory. Today, this is known as the Miasma theory. The word 'plague' had no special significance at this time, and only the recurrence of outbreaks during the Middle Ages gave it the name that has become the medical term.The importance of hygiene was recognised only in the nineteenth century; until then it was common that the streets were filthy, with live animals of all sorts around and human parasites abounding. A transmissible disease will spread easily in such conditions. One development as a result of the Black Death was the establishment of the idea of quarantine in Dubrovnik in 1377 after continuing outbreaks.The dominant explanation for the Black Death is the plague theory, which attributes the outbreak to ''Yersinia pestis'', also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern China in 1865, eventually spreading to India. The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin, after whom the pathogen was named ''Yersinia pestis''. The mechanism by which ''Y. pestis'' was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul-Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating ''Y. pestis'' several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second that lack resistance. When the second population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human epidemic.Chritakos2005The historian Francis Aidan Gasquet wrote about the 'Great Pestilence' in 18931893 and suggested that "it would appear to be some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague". He was able to adopt the epidemiology of the bubonic plague for the Black Death for the second edition in 1908, implicating rats and fleas in the process, and his interpretation was widely accepted for other ancient and medieval epidemics, such as the Justinian plague that was prevalent in the Eastern Roman Empire from 541 to 700 CE.Chritakos2005Other forms of plague have been implicated by modern scientists. The modern bubonic plague has a mortality rate of 30–75% and symptoms including fever of , headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a general feeling of malaise. Left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 percent die within eight days. Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 percent. Symptoms include fever, cough, and blood-tinged sputum. As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free flowing and bright red. Septicemic plague is the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate near 100%. Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches (purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation). In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague, the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.DNA evidenceFile:Bubonic plague victims-mass grave in Martigues, France 1720-1721.jpg|thumb|Skeletons in a mass grave from 1720–1721 in Martigues, France, yielded molecular evidence of the ''orientalis'' strain of ''Yersinia pestis'', the organism responsible for bubonic plague. The second pandemic of bubonic plague was active in Europe from AD 1347, the beginning of the Black Death, until 1750.In October 2010, the open-access scientific journal ''PLoS Pathogens'' published a paper by a multinational team who undertook a new investigation into the role of ''Yersinia pestis'' in the Black Death following the disputed identification by Drancourt and Raoult in 1998. They assessed the presence of DNA/RNA with Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) techniques for ''Y. pestis'' from the tooth sockets in human skeletons from mass graves in northern, central and southern Europe that were associated archaeologically with the Black Death and subsequent resurgences. The authors concluded that this new research, together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany, see also ". . . ends the debate about the etiology of the Black Death, and unambiguously demonstrates that ''Y. pestis'' was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages".Haensch2010The study also found that there were two previously unknown but related clades (genetic branches) of the ''Y. pestis'' genome associated with medieval mass graves. These clades (which are thought to be extinct) were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern ''Y. pestis'' strains ''Y. p. orientalis'' and ''Y. p. medievalis'', suggesting the plague may have entered Europe in two waves. Surveys of plague pit remains in France and England indicate the first variant entered Europe through the port of Marseille around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years, eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349, where it spread through the country in three epidemics. Surveys of plague pit remains from the Dutch town of Bergen op Zoom showed the ''Y. pestis'' genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the Low Countries from 1350 differed from that found in Britain and France, implying Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France in 1349 and suggesting a second wave of plague, different from those in Britain and France, may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway, the Hanseatic cities or another site.The results of the Haensch study have since been confirmed and amended. Based on genetic evidence derived from Black Death victims in the East Smithfield burial site in England, Schuenemann et al. concluded in 2011 "that the Black Death in medieval Europe was caused by a variant of ''Y. pestis'' that may no longer exist."Schuenemann VJ, Bos K, DeWitte S, Schmedes S, Jamieson J, Mittnik A, Forrest S, Coombes BK, Wood JW, Earn DJD, White W, Krause J, Poinar H (2011):  PNAS 2011; published ahead of print 29 August 2011,  A study published in ''Nature'' in October 2011 sequenced the genome of ''Y. pestis'' from plague victims and indicated that the strain that caused the Black Death is ancestral to most modern strains of the disease.'nature_bos'DNA taken from 25 skeletons from the 14th century found in London have shown the plague is a strain of ''Y. pestis'' that is almost identical to that which hit Madagascar in 2013.guardianAlternative explanationsTheories of the Black DeathThe plague theory was first significantly challenged by the work of British bacteriologist J. F. D. Shrewsbury in 1970, who noted that the reported rates of mortality in rural areas during the 14th-century pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague, leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations.Chritakos2005In 1984 zoologist Graham Twigg produced the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly, and his doubts about the identity of the Black Death have been taken up by a number of authors, including Samuel K. Cohn, Jr. (2002), David Herlihy (1997), and Susan Scott and Christopher Duncan (2001).Chritakos2005It is recognised that an epidemiological account of the plague is as important as an identification of symptoms, but researchers are hampered by the lack of reliable statistics from this period. Most work has been done on the spread of the plague in England, and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100% as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the Domesday Book and the year 1377. Estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy.In addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique (and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague); that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance; and that the DNA results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere, despite extensive samples from other mass graves.Chritakos2005Other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries; temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas; that, despite primitive transport systems, the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague; that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high; that, while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease, the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas; and that the pattern of the Black Death, with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years, differs from modern bubonic plague—which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups.Chritakos2005Walløe complains that all of these authors "take it for granted that Simond's infection model, black rat → rat flea → human, which was developed to explain the spread of plague in India, is the only way an epidemic of ''Yersinia pestis'' infection could spread", whilst pointing to several other possibilities.File:Anthrax PHIL 2033.png|thumb|Anthrax skin lesionA variety of alternatives to the ''Y. pestis'' have been put forward. Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax, and Norman Cantor (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as ''hemorrhagic'' plague similar to Ebola. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the ''Y. pestis'' was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person... However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance.Chritakos2005Many scholars arguing for the ''Y. pestis'' as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of "blood poisoning") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms. In 2014, scientists with Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis.guardianConsequencesConsequences of the Black DeathDeath tollFile:Burying Plague Victims of Tournai.jpg|thumb|Citizens of Tournai bury plague victims.There are no exact figures for the death toll; the rate varied widely by locality.  In urban centers, the greater the population before the outbreak, the longer the duration of the period of abnormal mortality. It killed some 75 to 200 million people in Eurasia."ABC/Reuters""Health. De-coding the Black Death""Black Death's Gene Code Cracked"According to medieval historian Philip Daileader in 2007:The trend of recent research is pointing to a figure more like 45–50% of the European population dying during a four-year period. There is a fair amount of geographic variation. In Mediterranean Europe, areas such as Italy, the south of France and Spain, where plague ran for about four years consecutively, it was probably closer to 75–80% of the population. In Germany and England ... it was probably closer to 20%.Philip Daileader, ''The Late Middle Ages'', audio/video course produced by The Teaching Company, (2007) ISBN 978-1-59803-345-8.;/blockquote;The most widely accepted estimate for the Middle East, including Iraq, Iran and Syria, during this time, is for a death rate of about a third. The Black Death killed about 40% of Egypt's population.[Egypt – Major Cities], ''U.S. Library of Congress'' Half of Paris's population of 100,000 people died. In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from 110–120thousand inhabitants in 1338 down to 50thousand in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well. Interestingly while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time. Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die.Chritakos2005The disease bypassed some areas, and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion. Monks and priests were especially hard hit since they cared for victims of the Black Death.PersecutionsBlack Death Jewish persecutionsFile:Danse macabre by Michael Wolgemut.png|thumb|Inspired by the Black Death, ''The Dance of Death'' or ''Danse Macabre'', an allegory on the universality of death, was a common painting motif in the late medieval period.Renewed religious fervor and fanaticism bloomed in the wake of the Black Death. Some Europeans targeted "various groups such as Jews, friars, foreigners, beggars, pilgrims", lepers,nirenbergand Romani, thinking that they were to blame for the crisis. Lepers, and other individuals with skin diseases such as acne or psoriasis, were singled out and exterminated throughout Europe.Because 14th-century healers were at a loss to explain the cause, Europeans turned to astrological forces, earthquakes, and the poisoning of wells by Jews as possible reasons for the plague's emergence.Bennet;Hollister2006The governments of Europe had no apparent response to the crisis because no one knew its cause or how it spread. The mechanism of infection and transmission of diseases was little understood in the 14th century; many people believed only God's anger could produce such horrific displays.There were many attacks against Jewish communities., Jewishencyclopedia.com In February 1349, the citizens of Strasbourg murdered 2,000 Jews.JewishEncyclopediaIn August 1349, the Jewish communities in Mainz and Cologne were exterminated. By 1351, 60 major and 150 smaller Jewish communities had been destroyed..RecurrenceSecond plague pandemicThe Great Plague of London, in 1665, killed up to 100,000 peopleThe plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries."''''".

This led to the establishment of a Public Health Department there which undertook some leading-edge research on plague transmission from rat fleas to humans via the bacillus ''Yersinia pestis''.[Bubonic Plague comes to Sydney in 1900], University of Sydney, Sydney Medical SchoolThe first North American plague epidemic was the San Francisco plague of 1900–04, followed by another outbreak in 1907–08.From 1944 through 1993, 362 cases of human plague were reported in the United States; approximately 90% occurred in four western states: Arizona, California, Colorado, and New Mexico.[Human Plague – United States, 1993–1994], Centers for Disease Control and PreventionRecent outbreaksPlague was confirmed in the United States from 9 western states during 1995. Currently, 5 to 15 people in the United States are estimated to catch the disease each year—typically in western states. The reservoir is thought to be mice.TreatmentModern treatment methods include insecticides, the use of antibiotics, and a plague vaccine. The plague bacterium could develop drug-resistance and again become a major health threat. One case of a drug-resistant form of the bacterium was found in Madagascar in 1995., SciDev.Net. A further outbreak in Madagascar was reported in November 2014.See also* ''Black Death'' (film)* Black Death in England* CCR5, a human gene hypothesised to be associated with the plague* ''Cronaca fiorentina'' (''Chronicle of Florence''); a literary history of the plague, and of Florence up to 1386, by Baldassarre Bonaiuti* Crisis of the Late Middle Ages* Danse Macabre* Death* Four thieves vinegar; a popular French legend says this recipe provided immunity to the plague.* Geisslerlieder* Globalization and disease* Plague doctor* Plague doctor costume* Ring a Ring o' Roses* ''The Seventh Seal'', a film directed by Ingmar BergmanReferences3Further reading*** Cantor, Norman F.
