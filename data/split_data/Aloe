File:Split Aloe.jpg|thumb|180px|Succulent plants, such as this aloe, store water in their enlarged fleshy leaves, stems, or roots, as shown in this split aloe leaf. This allows them to survive in arid environments. File:Aloe vossii - plant (aka).jpg|right|thumb|180px|''Aloe vossii'''''''Aloe''''' ( or ), also written ''Aloë'', is a genus containing over 500 species of flowering succulent plants.The Plant List (2010). Version 1. Published on the Internet; (accessed July 2013)  The most widely known species is ''Aloe vera'', or "true aloe", so called because, though probably extinct in the wild, it is cultivated as the standard source of so-called "aloe vera" for assorted pharmaceutical purposes. Other species, such as ''Aloe ferox'', also are cultivated or harvested from the wild for similar applications.The APG III system (2009) places the genus in the family Xanthorrhoeaceae, subfamily Asphodeloideae.Stevens, P.F. (2001 onwards), "[Paracryphiaceae]", ''Angiosperm Phylogeny Website'', retrieved 2014-09-19 In the past, it has been assigned to the family Aloaceae (now included in the Xanthorrhoeaceae) or to a broadly circumscribed family Liliaceae (the lily family). The plant ''Agave americana'', which is sometimes called "American aloe", belongs to the Asparagaceae, a different family.The genus is native to tropical and southern Africa, Madagascar, Jordan, the Arabian Peninsula, and various islands in the Indian Ocean (Mauritius, Réunion, Comoros, etc.). A few species have also become naturalized in other regions (Mediterranean, India, Australia, North and South America, etc.).DescriptionMost ''Aloe'' species have a rosette of large, thick, fleshy leaves. ''Aloe'' flowers are tubular, frequently yellow, orange, pink, or red, and are borne, densely clustered and pendant, at the apex of simple or branched, leafless stems. Many species of ''Aloe'' appear to be stemless, with the rosette growing directly at ground level; other varieties may have a branched or unbranched stem from which the fleshy leaves spring. They vary in color from grey to bright-green and are sometimes striped or mottled. Some aloes native to South Africa are tree-like (arborescent).SystematicsThe APG III system (2009) places the genus in the family Xanthorrhoeaceae, subfamily Asphodeloideae."Stevens 2001 onwards"In the past it has also been assigned to the families Liliaceae and Aloeaceae, as well as the family Asphodelaceae, before this was merged into the Xanthorrhoeaceae.The circumscription of the genus has varied widely. Many genera, such as ''Lomatophyllum'', have been brought into synonymy. Species at one time placed in ''Aloe'', such as ''Agave americana'', have been moved to other genera.SpeciesOver 500 species are accepted in the genus ''Aloe'', plus even more synonyms and unresolved species, subspecies, varieties, and hybrids.

Many aloe species are highly decorative and are valued by collectors of succulents.  ''Aloe vera'' is used both internally and externally on humans, and is claimed to have some medicinal effects, which have been supported by scientific and medical research.NIHThey can also be made into types of special soaps.Historical usesHistorical use of various aloe species is well documented. Documentation of the clinical effectiveness is available, although relatively limited.NIHOf the 500+ species, only a few were used traditionally as herbal medicines, ''Aloe vera'' again being the most commonly used species.  Also included are ''A. perryi'' and ''A. ferox''. The Ancient Greeks and Romans used ''Aloe vera'' to treat wounds. In the Middle Ages, the yellowish liquid found inside the leaves was favored as a purgative. Unprocessed aloe that contains aloin is generally used as a laxative, whereas processed juice does not usually contain significant aloin.Some species, particularly ''Aloe vera'', are used in alternative medicine and first aid. Both the translucent inner pulp and the resinous yellow aloin from wounding the aloe plant are used externally to relieve skin discomforts. As an herbal medicine, ''Aloe vera'' juice is commonly used internally to relieve digestive discomfort.Relatively few studies about possible benefits of aloe gel taken internally have been conducted. Components of ''Aloe'' have shown the possibility of inhibiting tumor growth in animal studies, but these effects have not been demonstrated clinically in humans.  Some studies in animal models indicate that extracts of ''Aloe'' have a significant antihyperglycemic effect, and may be useful in treating Type II diabetes, but these studies have not been confirmed in humans.According to Cancer Research UK, a potentially deadly product called T-UP is made of concentrated aloe, and promoted as a cancer cure. They say "there is currently no evidence that aloe products can help to prevent or treat cancer in humans".Aloin in OTC laxative productsOn May 9, 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a final rule banning the use of aloin, the yellow sap of the aloe plant, for use as a laxative ingredient in over-the-counter drug products. Most aloe juices today do not contain significant aloin.Chemical propertiesAccording to W. A. Shenstone, two classes of aloins are recognized: (1) nataloins, which yield picric and oxalic acids with nitric acid, and do not give a red coloration with nitric acid; and (2) barbaloins, which yield aloetic acid (C7H2N3O5), chrysammic acid (C7H2N2O6), picric and oxalic acids with nitric acid, being reddened by the acid. This second group may be divided into a-barbaloins, obtained from Barbados ''Aloe'', and reddened in the cold, and b-barbaloins, obtained from ''Aloe Socotrina'' and Zanzibar ''Aloe'', reddened by ordinary nitric acid only when warmed or by fuming acid in the cold. Nataloin (2C17H13O7·H2O) forms bright-yellow scales, barbaloin (C17H18O7) prismatic crystals. ''Aloe'' species also contain a trace of volatile oil, to which their odour is due.Flavoring''Aloe perryi'', ''A. barbadensis'', ''A. ferox'', and hybrids of this species with ''A. africana'' and ''A. spicata'' are listed as natural flavoring substances in the US government ''Electronic Code of Federal Regulations''. ''Aloe Socotrina'' is said to be used in yellow Chartreuse.John Tellman (1900)  [''The Practical Hotel Steward''], The Hotel Monthly, ChicagoHeraldic occurrence''Aloe rubrolutea'' occurs as a charge in heraldry, for example in the Civic Heraldry of Namibia.ImagesFile:Aloe ferox.JPG|''Aloe ferox'' ("Cape Aloe")File:Aloe africana 1.jpg|''Aloe africana'' ("Africa Aloe")File:Aloe pluridens (3).jpg|''Aloe pluridens'' ("French Aloe")File:Aloe excelsa at Mount Coot-tha.JPG|''Aloe excelsa'' ("Zimbabwe Aloe")File:Aloe speciosa - tilt head aloe.jpg|''Aloe hexapetala'' ("Tilt-headed Aloe")File:Aloe thraskii close.JPG|''Aloe thraskii'' ("Dune Aloe")File:Babosa1.jpg|''Aloe arborescens''File:Blooming aloes wide view alternate, with bright sun behind.jpg|Blooming ''Aloe arborescens''File:Aloe aristata.jpg|''Aloe aristata''File:Aloe cooperi in flower IMG 1702e.JPG|''Aloe cooperi'' (''Aloe plicatilis'' in background on the right)File:Köcherbaum Köcherbaumwald 01.JPG|''Aloe dichotoma''File:Aloe hereroensis Auob C15.JPG|''Aloe hereroensis''File:Aloe parvula.JPG|''Aloe parvula''File:Aloe peglerae01.jpg|''Aloe peglerae''File:Aloe saponaria 1.jpg|''Aloe maculata'' - prev.
