The territory lies west of the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir, and was previously part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, which ceased to exist as a result of the first Kashmir war fought between India and Pakistan in 1947.Azad Kashmir is part of the greater Kashmir region, which is the subject of a long-running conflict between India and Pakistan. The territory shares a border with Gilgit–Baltistan, together with which it is referred to by the United Nations and other international organisations as "Pakistan-administered Kashmir".The territory also borders Pakistan's Punjab province to the south and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to the west. To the east, Azad Kashmir is separated from the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir by the Line of Control, the ''de facto'' border between India and Pakistan. Azad Kashmir has a total area of sqmi, with an estimated population of around 4.6 million people.The territory has a parliamentary form of government, with its capital located at Muzaffarabad. The President of Azad Jammu and Kashmir is the constitutional head of the state, while the prime minister, supported by a Council of Ministers, is the chief executive. The unicameral Azad Jammu ; Kashmir Legislative Assembly elects both the prime minister and president. The state has its own Supreme Court and a High Court, while the Government of Pakistan's Ministry of Kashmir Affairs serves as a link between it and Azad Kashmir's government. Neither Azad Kashmir nor Gilgit-Baltistan elect members to Pakistan's National Assembly.A 2005 earthquake killed 100,000 people and left another three million people displaced, with widespread devastation. Since then, with help from the Government of Pakistan and foreign donors, reconstruction of infrastructure is underway. Azad Kashmir's economy largely depends on agriculture, services, tourism, and remittances sent by members of the British Mirpuri community. The territory's official language is Urdu, although Pahari, Hindko, Gojri, Punjabi, and Pashto are also spoken. It has a literacy rate of approximately 64%.HistoryHistory of Azad KashmirMap of the entire Kashmir regionAt the time of the Partition of India in 1947, the British abandoned their suzerainty over the princely states, which were left with the options of joining India or Pakistan or remaining independent. Wanting  his state to remain independent, Hari Singh, the maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, signed a stand-still agreement with Pakistan and delayed his final decision in an effort to remain independent.In Spring 1947, an uprising against the Maharaja broke out in Poonch, an area bordering the Rawalpindi division of West Punjab. Maharaja's administration is said to have started levying punitive taxes on the peasantry which provoked a local revolt and the administration resorted to brutal suppression. The area's population, swelled by recently demobilised soldiers following World War II, rebelled against the Maharaja's forces and gained control of almost the entire district. Following this victory, the pro-Pakistan chieftains of the western Jammu districts of Muzaffarabad, Poonch and Mirpur proclaimed a provisional Azad Jammu and Kashmir government in Rawalpindi on 3October 1947.On 21October, several thousand Pashtun tribesmen from North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier Province poured into Jammu and Kashmir to liberate it from the Maharaja's rule. They were led by experienced military leaders and were equipped with modern arms. The Maharaja's crumbling forces were unable to withstand the onslaught. The raiders captured the towns of Muzaffarabad and Baramulla, the latter mi northwest of the state capital Srinagar. On 24October, the Maharaja requested military assistance from India, which responded that it was unable to help him unless he acceded to India. Accordingly, on 26October 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh signed an Instrument of Accession, handing over control of defence, external affairs and communications to the Government of India in return for military aid. Indian troops were immediately airlifted into Srinagar. Pakistan intervened subsequently. britannicaFighting ensued between the Indian and Pakistani armies, with the two areas of control more or less stabilised around what is now known as the "Line of Control".India later approached the United Nations, asking it to resolve the dispute, and resolutions were passed in favour of the holding of a plebiscite with regard to Kashmir's future. However, no such plebiscite has ever been held on either side, since there was a precondition which required the withdrawal of the Pakistani Army along with the non-state elements and the subsequent partial withdrawal of the Indian Army.from the parts of Kashmir under their respective control– a withdrawal that never took place.In 1949, a formal cease-fire line separating the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir came into effect.Following the 1949 cease-fire agreement, the government of Pakistan divided the northern and western parts of Kashmir that it occupied at the time of cease-fire into the following two separately-controlled political entities:* Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK)– the narrow, southern part, km long, with a width varying from km.* Gilgit–Baltistan formerly called the Federally Administered Northern Areas (FANA)– the much larger political entity to the north of AJK with an area of sqmi. It was directly administered by Pakistan as ''a de facto'' dependent territory, i.e., a non-self-governing territory. However, it was ostensibly granted "full autonomy" on 29August 2009.At one time under Pakistani control, Kashmir's Shaksgam tract, a small region along the northeastern border of Gilgit–Baltistan, was provisionally ceded by Pakistan to the People's Republic of China in 1963 and now forms part of China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.In 1972, the then current border between the Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of Kashmir was designated as the "Line of Control". This line has remained unchangedsince the 1972 Simla Agreement, which bound the two countries "to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations". Some political experts claim that, in view of that pact, the only solution to the issue is mutual negotiation between the two countries without involving a third party such as the United Nations.GovernmentDistricts of Azad KashmirAzad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) is a self-governing state under Pakistani control, but under Pakistan's constitution the state is not formally a part of the country as the dispute on Azad Kashmir has not yet been resolved. Pakistan is administering the region as a self-governing territory rather than incorporating it in the federation since the UN mandated ceasefire.britajk144Azad Kashmir has its own elected President, Prime Minister, Legislative Assembly, High Court, with Azam khan as its present chief justice, and official flag.  The government of Pakistan has not yet allowed Azad Kashmir to issue its own postage stamps, meaning that those of Pakistan are used instead. Brad Adams the Asia director at the U.S. based NGO Human Rights Watch has said in 2006 Although ‘azad’ means ‘free,’ the residents of Azad Kashmir are anything but, The Pakistani authorities govern Azad Kashmir with strict controls on basic freedoms.;/blockquote;  The Government of Azad Kashmir has very little control over its territory, with its politicians mainly spending their time in Islamabad.Azad Kashmir's financial matters, i.e., budget and tax affairs, are dealt with by the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council rather than by Pakistan's Central Board of Revenue. The Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council is a supreme body consisting of 14 members, 8 from the government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and 6 from the government of Pakistan. Its chairman/chief executive is the prime minister of Pakistan. Other members of the council are the president and the prime minister of Azad Kashmir(or and individual nominated by her/him) and 6 members of the AJK Legislative Assembly."" at britannica.comAzad Kashmir Day is celebrated in Azad Jammu and Kashmir on October 24, which is the day that the Azad Jammu and Kashmir government was created in 1947. Pakistan has celebrated Kashmir Solidarity Day on February 5 of each year since 1990 as a day of protest against India's ''de facto'' sovereignty over its State of Jammu and Kashmir.That day is a national holiday in Pakistan.Kashmiris in Azad Kashmir observe the Kashmir Black Day on October 27 of each year since 1947 as day of protest against military occupation in Indian controlled Jammu and Kashmir.Administrative divisionsThe state is administratively divided into three divisions which, in turn, are divided into ten districts.{| class="sortable wikitable"|-!Division!District!Area (km²)!Population (2008)!Headquarters|-|'''Mirpur'''||Mirpur||2,310||754,482||Mirpur|-| ||Kotli||2,162||834,094||Kotli|-| ||Bhimber||1,516||301,633||Bhimber|-|'''Muzaffarabad'''||Muzaffarabad ||2,496||638,973||Muzaffarabad|-| ||Hattian||854||251,000||Hattian Bala|-| ||Neelam||3,621||106,778||Athmuqam|-|'''Poonch'''||Poonch||855||411,035||Rawalakot|-| ||Haveli||600 (est.) ||150,000 (est.) ||Forward Kahuta|-| ||Bagh||768||351,415||Bagh|-| ||Sudhanoti||569||204,091||Palandri|-| colspan=5 style="background: black" ||-|'''AJK Total'''|10 districts|13,297|4,567,982|Muzaffarabad|}Kotla Bagh Azad KashmirGeography and climateLandscape of Azad kashmirFile:Awan patti n.jpg|thumbnail|Lush Green View of Awan Patti, Azad KashmirThe northern part of Azad Jammu and Kashmir encompasses the lower part of the Himalayas, including Jamgarh Peak (15,531 feet [4,734 meters]). However, Sarwali peak in the Neelum Valley is the highest peak in the state. Fertile, green, mountainous valleys are characteristic of Azad Kashmir's geography, making it one of the most beautiful regions on the subcontinent.britThe southern parts of Azad Kashmir including Bhimber, Mirpur and Kotli districts has extremely hot weather in summers and moderate cold weather in winters. It receives rains mostly in monsoon weather.Paddy field in Leepa valleyIn the central and northern parts of state weather remains moderate hot in summers and very cold and chilly in winter. Snow fall also occurs there in December and January.This region receives rainfall in both winters and summers. Muzaffarabad and Pattan are among the wettest areas of the state. Throughout most of the region, the average rainfall exceeds 1400mm, with the highest average rainfall occurring near Muzaffarabad (around 1800mm). During summer, monsoon floods of the Jhelum and Leepa rivers are common, due to high rainfall and melting snow.CultureThe culture of Azad Kashmir has many similarities to that of northern Punjabi (Potohar) culture in Punjab province. The natives of Azad Kashmir speak Urdu, Potwari, and the Pahari languages. The traditional dress of the women is the shalwar kameez in Pahari style. The shalwar kameez is commonly worn by both men and women. Women use shawl to cover their head and upper body.The popular and traditional cuisines of Azad Kashmir are Raan (Fried leg of Lamb), Rogan Josh, Balti Gosht, Dal Chawal (A mixture of split peas, split red lentils, and boiled rice), and Dam Aloo (Fried Potatoes). The traditional drink of the region is tea.Ethnic groupsDemographics of Azad KashmirAzad Jammu and Kashmir is almost entirely Muslim. This inhabitants of this region are of many communities and tribes who share ethnic and linguistic similarities with the people of Northern Punjab. While Urdu is the official language of the region, other languages commonly spoken are Pahari, Gojri and Potohari.: On p.29, the census report states that Urdu is the official language of the Government of Azad Kashmir, with Kashmiri, Pahari, Gojri, Punjabi, Kohistani, Pushto and Sheena `frequently spoken in Azad Kashmir'. Yet, when surveyed about their `Mother Tongue', Azad Kashmiris' choices were limited to selecting from Pakistan's major languages: Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Pushto, Balochi, Saraiki and `Others'; not surprisingly, 2.18 million of Azad Kashmir's 2.97 million people chose `Others'. The main communities living in this region are as follows:Gurjar-They are an agricultural tribe and are estimated to be the largest community living in Azad Jammu and Kashmir."The Role of Biradaris"Jat- They are one of the larger community of AJK and primarily inhabit the Districts of Mirpur, Bhimber and Kotli. A large Mirpuri population lives in the UK and it is estimated that more people of Mirpuri origins are now residing in the UK than in Mirpur district. The district Mirpur retains strong ties with the UK."The Role of Biradaris"Pahari Rajputs- They are a community of Pahari speaking Rajputs like Jarral Rajputs, Thakial Rajputs, etc. They primarily inhabit the Districts of Muzaffarabad, Bagh, Mirpur, Bhimber and Kotli"The Role of Biradaris""Poonch Profile"Sudhan- They are a large clan living in Poonch, Sudhanoti, Bagh and Kolti districts."The Role of Biradaris""Poonch Profile"Abbasi- They are a large clan in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and mostly live in Bhag, Hattian Bala and Muzaffarabad districts.

Besides Azad Kashmir they also reside in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in large numbers."The Role of Biradaris""Poonch Profile""Bagh Profile"EconomyEconomy of Azad KashmirNeelum valley is a popular tourist destination in Azad Kashmir.Historically the economy of these areas now called ‘Azad’ Kashmir has been agricultural which meant that land was the main source or mean of production. This means that all food for immediate and long term consumption was produced from land. The produce included various crops, fruits, vegetables etc. Land was also the source of other livelihood necessities such as wood, fuel, grazing for animals which then turned into dairy products. Because of this land was also the main source of revenue for the governments whose primary purpose for centuries was to accumulate revenue.Agriculture is a major part of Azad Kashmir's economy. Low-lying areas that have high populations grow crops like barley, mangoes, millet, corn (maize), and wheat, and also raise cattle. In the elevated areas that are less populated and more spread-out, forestry, corn, and livestock are the main sources of income. There are mineral and marble resources in Azad Kashmir close to Mirpur and Muzaffarabad. There are also graphite deposits at Mohriwali. There are also reservoirs of low-grade coal, chalk, bauxite, and zircon. Local household industries produce carved wooden objects, textiles, and dhurrie carpets.britThere is also an arts and crafts industry that produces such cultural goods as namdas, shawls, pashmina, pherans, Papier-mâché, basketry copper, rugs, wood carving, silk and woolen clothing, patto, carpets, namda gubba, and silverware. Agricultural goods produced in the region include mushrooms, honey, walnuts, apples, cherries, medicinal herbs and plants, resin, deodar, kail, chir, fir, maple, and ash timber.britajk144Munda Gali Leepa valley AJKThe migration to UK was accelerated and by the completion of Mangla Dam in 1967 the process of ‘chain migration’ became in full flow. Today, remittances from British Mirpuri community make a critical role in AJK's economy. In the mid-1950s various economic and social development processes were launched in Azad Kashmir. In the 1960s, with the construction of the Mangla Dam in Mirpur District, the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Government began to receive royalties from the Pakistani government for the electricity that the dam provided to Pakistan. During the mid-2000s, a multibillion-dollar reconstruction began in the aftermath of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake.In addition to agriculture, textiles, and arts and crafts, remittances have played a major role in the economy of Azad Kashmir. One analyst estimated that the figure for Azad Kashmir was 25.1% in 2001. With regard to annual household income, people living in the higher areas are more dependent on remittances than are those living in the lower areas.In the latter part of 2006, billions of dollars for development were mooted by international aid agencies for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of earthquake-hit zones in Azad Kashmir, though much of that amount was subsequently lost in bureaucratic channels, leading to considerable delays in help getting to the most needy. Hundreds of people continued to live in tents long after the earthquake."dawn.com"A land-use plan for the city of Muzaffarabad was prepared by the Japan International Cooperation Agency.Kashmir as a whole is the one of the most beautiful regions in the world.
