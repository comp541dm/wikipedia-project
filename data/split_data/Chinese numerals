'''Chinese numerals''' are words and characters used to denote numbers in Chinese.Today speakers of Chinese use three written numeral systems: the system of Arabic numerals used world-wide, and two indigenous systems. The more familiar indigenous system is based on Chinese characters that correspond to numerals in the spoken language. These are shared with other languages of the Chinese cultural sphere such as Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese. Most people and institutions in China primarily use the Arabic system for convenience, with traditional Chinese numerals used in finance, mainly for writing amounts on checks, banknotes, some ceremonial occasions, some boxes, and on commercials.The other indigenous system is the Suzhou numerals, or ''huama'', a positional system, the only surviving form of the rod numerals. These were once used by Chinese mathematicians, and later in Chinese markets, such as those in Hong Kong before the 1990s, but have been gradually supplanted by Arabic (and also Roman) numerals.Characters used to represent numbersChinese and Arabic numerals may coexist, as on this kilometer marker: 1620 km on Hwy G209 (G二〇九)The Chinese character numeral system consists of the Chinese characters used by the Chinese written language to write spoken numerals. Similar to spelling-out numbers in English (e.g., "one thousand nine hundred forty-five"), it is not an independent system ''per se''. Since it reflects spoken language, it does not use the positional system as in Arabic numerals, in the same way that spelling out numbers in English does not.Standard numbersThere are characters representing the numbers zero through nine, and other characters representing larger numbers such as tens, hundreds, thousands and so on. There are two sets of characters for Chinese numerals: one for everyday writing and one for use in commercial or financial contexts known as ''dàxiě'' (). The latter arose because the characters used for writing numerals are geometrically simple, so simply using those numerals cannot prevent forgeries in the same way spelling numbers out in English would.[大寫數字『] A forger could easily change the everyday characters wikt:三十|三十 (30) to wikt:五千|五千 (5000) just by adding a few strokes. That would not be possible when writing using the financial characters wikt:參拾|參拾(30) and wikt:伍仟|伍仟 (5000). They are also referred to as "banker's numerals", "anti-fraud numerals", or "banker's anti-fraud numerals". For the same reason, rod numerals were never used in commercial records.'''T''' denotes Traditional Chinese characters, '''S''' denotes Simplified Chinese characters.{| class="wikitable"|-! colspan="2" | Financial! colspan="2" | Normal! rowspan="2" | Value! rowspan="2" | Pīnyīn (Mandarin)! rowspan="2" | Jyutping (Cantonese)! rowspan="2" | Pe̍h-ōe-jī (Hokkien)! rowspan="2" | Notes|-!

It is used in Mandarin to unambiguously pronounce "#1" in a series of one (一) such as phone numbers and ID numbers, because reading them together in a row is not  distinguishable (e.g. 一一一 would be pronounced as "yao-yao-yao" instead of sounding like "YEEEEEE").

It can be used as a general number to represent "three" (e.g.第仨号 ''dì sā hào'', "number three"; 星期仨 ''xīngqīsā'', "Wednesday"), or as an alternative for 三个 "three of" (e.g. 我们仨 ''Wǒmen sā'', "the three of us", as opposed to 我们三个 ''Wǒmen sān gè''). Regardless of usage, a measure word (such as 个) never follows after 仨.|-||align=center|wikt:呀|呀|align=center|10|align=center| yā|align=center|wikt:十|十| In Cantonese speech, when 十 is used in the middle of a number, preceded by a multiplier and followed by a ones digit, 十 becomes 呀 (aa6), e.g. 六呀三, 63. This usage is not observed in Mandarin.|-|align=center|wikt:念|念|align=center|wikt:廿|廿|align=center|20|align=center|niàn|align=center|wikt:二十|二十|The written form is still used to refer to dates, especially Chinese calendar dates.Spoken form is still used in various dialects of Chinese. See Reading and transcribing numbers section below.In Cantonese, 廿 (jaa6) must be followed by another digit 1-9 (e.g. 廿三, 23), a measure word (e.g. 廿個), or be in a phrase like 廿幾 ("twenty-something"); it is not used by itself to mean 20.wikt:卄|卄 is a rare variant.|-||align=center|wikt:卅|卅|align=center|30|align=center|sà|align=center|wikt:三十|三十|The written form is still used to abbreviate date references in Chinese. For example, May 30 Movement (五卅運動).Spoken form is still used in various dialects of Chinese. See Reading and transcribing numbers section below.

The usage of the word 卌 is done in the following matter, "sei(四) ah ##", or "4 ah ##". Thus 41 would be pronounced "sei ah yat", i.e. "four ah one".|-||align=center|wikt:皕|皕|align=center|200|align=center|bì|align=center|wikt:二百|二百|Very rarely used; one example is in the name of a library in Huzhou, 皕宋樓 (''Bìsòng Lóu'').|}Characters with military usageIn the PLA, some numbers will have altered names when used for clearer radio communications.

To avoid problems arising from the ambiguity, the PRC government never uses this character in official documents, but uses 万亿 (wànyì) instead. The ROC government in Taiwan uses 兆 (zhào) to mean 1012 in official documents.Numbers from BuddhismNumerals beyond 載 zài come from Buddhist texts in Sanskrit, but are mostly found in ancient texts.{| class="wikitable"|-!

The larger (兆, 京, 垓, 秭, 穰) and smaller Chinese numerals (微, 纖, 沙, 塵, 渺) were defined as translations for the SI prefixes as ''mega'', ''giga'', ''tera'', ''peta'', ''exa'', ''micro'', ''nano'',  ''pico'',  ''femto'',  ''atto'', resulting in the creation of yet more values for each numeral. , [No. 365], page 575, Table 7: SI prefixesThe Republic of China (Taiwan) defined 百萬 as the translation for ''mega''. This translation is widely used in official documents, academic communities, informational industries, etc. However, the civil broadcasting industries sometimes use wikt:兆赫|兆赫 to represent "megahertz".Today, the governments of both China and Taiwan use phonetic transliterations for the SI prefixes.

Use of both 兩 (liǎng) or 二 (èr) are acceptable for the number 200. When writing in the Cantonese dialect, 二 (yi6) is used to represent the "2" numeral for all numbers.  In the southern Min dialect of Chaozhou (Teochew), 兩 (no6) is used to represent the "2" numeral in all numbers from 200 onwards.

In some dialects, like Shanghainese, when there are only two significant digits in the number, the leading "one" and the trailing zeroes are omitted.  Sometimes, the one before "ten" in the middle of a number, such as 213, is omitted.

Hence it is more convenient to think of numbers here as in groups of four, thus 1,234,567,890 is regrouped here as 12,3456,7890.  Larger than a myriad, each number is therefore four zeroes longer than the one before it, thus 10000 × wàn (萬) = yì (億). If one of the numbers is between 10 and 19, the leading "one" is omitted as per the above point.  Hence (numbers in parentheses indicate that the number has been written as one number rather than expanded):{| class="wikitable"|-! Number! Structure! Characters|-| 12,345,678,902,345(12,3456,7890,2345) || (12) [1,0000,0000,0000] (3456) [1,0000,0000] (7890) [1,0000] (2345) || 十二兆三千四百五十六億七千八百九十萬兩千三百四十五|}Interior zeroes before the unit position (as in 1002) must be spelt explicitly.  The reason for this is that trailing zeroes (as in 1200) are often omitted as shorthand, so ambiguity occurs.  One zero is sufficient to resolve the ambiguity.  Where the zero is before a digit other than the units digit, the explicit zero is not ambiguous and is therefore optional, but preferred.  Thus:{| class="wikitable"|-! Number! Structure!

This is the opposite of how fractions are read in English, which is numerator first. Each half of the fraction is written the same as a whole number.

For example, "three people" is expressed as 三个人 ''sān ge rén'', "three GE person", where 个 ''ge'' is a classifier. There exist many different classifiers, for use with different sets of nouns, although 个 is the most common, and may be used informally in place of other classifiers.Chinese uses cardinal numbers in certain situations in which English would use ordinals. For example, 三楼 ''sān lóu'' (literally "three story") means "third floor" ("second floor" in British numbering). Likewise, 二十一世纪 ''èrshí yī shìjì'' (literally "twenty-one century") is used for "21st century".Yip, Po-Ching; Rimmington, Don, ''Chinese: A Comprehensive Grammar'', Routledge, 2004, p. 12.Numbers of years are commonly spoken as a sequence of digits, as in 二零零一 ''èr líng líng yī'' ("two zero zero one") for the year 2001.Yip, Po-Ching; Rimmington, Don, ''Chinese: A Comprehensive Grammar'', Routledge, 2004, p. 13. Names of months and days (in the Western system) are also expressed using numbers: 一月 ''yīyuè'' ("one month") for January, etc.; and 星期一 ''xīngqīyī'' ("week one") for Monday, etc. (although Sunday is 星期日 ''xīngqīrì'', or informally 星期天 ''xīngqītiān'', "week day"). Full dates are usually written in the format 2001年1月20日 for January 20, 2001 (using 年 ''nián'' "year", 月 ''yuè'' "month", and 日 ''rì'' "day") – all the numbers are read as cardinals, not ordinals, with no leading zeroes, and the year is read as a sequence of digits. For brevity the year ''yuè'' and ''rì'' may be dropped to give a date composed of just numbers, so for example 64, in Chinese is six-four, short for month six-day four i.e. June Fourth, a common Chinese shorthand for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.Counting rod and Suzhou numeralsCounting rod numeralsSuzhou numeralsIn the same way that Roman numerals were standard in ancient and medieval Europe for mathematics and commerce, the Chinese formerly used the rod numerals, which is a positional system. The Suzhou numerals () system is a variation of the Southern Song rod numerals. Nowadays, the ''huāmǎ'' system is only used for displaying prices in Chinese markets or on traditional handwritten invoices.Hand gesturesChinese number gesturesThere is a common method of using of one hand to signify the numbers one to ten. While the five digits on one hand can express the numbers one to five, six to ten have special signs that can be used in commerce or day-to-day communication.Historical use of numerals in ChinaFile:Shang numerals.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Shang oracle bone numerals of 14th century B.C.The Shorter Science ; Civilisation in China Vol 2, An abridgement by Colin Ronan of Joseph Needham's original text, Table 20, p. 6, Cambridge University Press ISBN 0-521-23582-0right|250px|West Zhou dynasty bronze scriptrod numeral place value from Yongle EncyclopediaJapanese counting board with gridsMost Chinese numerals of later periods were descendants of the Shang dynasty oracle numerals of the 14th century BC. The oracle bone script numerals were found on tortoise shell and animal bones. In early civilizations, the Shang were able to express any numbers, however large, with only nine symbols and a counting board.The Shorter Science ; Civilisation in China Vol 2, An abridgement by Colin Ronan of Joseph Needham's original text, p5,Cambridge University Press  ISBN 0-521-23582-0Some of the bronze script numerals such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, and 13 became part of the system of rod numerals.In this system, horizontal rod numbers are used for the tens, thousands, hundred thousands etc.  Sun Tzu wrote that "one is vertical, ten is horizontal". 孫子算經: 先識其位，一從十橫，百立千僵，千十相望，萬百相當。{| border="0" width="500" align="center" style="border: 5px solid #999; background-color:#FFFFFF"|-align="center" bgcolor="#EFEFEF"! 七! 一! 八! 二! 四|-align="center" bgcolor="#EFEFEF"| 20px| 20px| 20px| 20px| 20px|-align="center" bgcolor="#EFEFEF"| 7| 1| 8| 2| 4|}The counting rod numerals system has place value and decimal numerals for computation, and was used widely by Chinese merchants, mathematicians and astronomers from the Han dynasty to the 16th century.Alexander Wylie, Christian missionary to China, in 1853 already refuted the notion that "the Chinese numbers were written in words at length", and stated that in ancient China, calculation was carried out by means of counting rods, and "the written character is evidently a rude presentation of these". After being introduced to the rod numerals, he said "Having thus obtained a simple but effective system of figures, we find the Chinese in actual use of a method of notation depending on the theory of local value [i.e. place-value], several centuries before such theory was understood in Europe, and while yet the science of numbers had scarcely dawned among the Arabs."During the Ming and Qing dynasties (after Arabic numerals were introduced into China), some Chinese mathematicians used Chinese numeral characters as positional system digits. After the Qing period, both the Chinese numeral characters and the Suzhou numerals were replaced by Arabic numerals in mathematical writings.Cultural influencesTraditional Chinese numeric characters are also used in Japan and Korea and were used in Vietnam before the 20th century. In vertical text (that is, read top to bottom), using characters for numbers is the norm, while in horizontal text, Arabic numerals are most common. Chinese numeric characters are also used in much the same formal or decorative fashion that Roman numerals are in Western cultures. Chinese numerals may appear together with Arabic numbers on the same sign or document.See also* Chinese number gestures* Numbers in Chinese culture* Chinese units of measurement* Chinese classifier* Chinese grammar* Japanese numerals* Korean numerals* Vietnamese numerals* Celestial stem* List of numbers in Sinitic languagesReferences2External linksChinese numerals*[Chinese/English Number Converter]*[Counting in Chinese - Caroline Baker - Counting in Chinese is as easy as ''Yi, Er, San''!]
