I think it would be wonderful if we created a table of of correspondences between the individual dialects. I don't think it would be necessary to mention the reconstructed phonemes, although it would be highly interesting, of course - the problem is that various scholars reconstruct the common ancestor of the Basque dialects somewhat differently, hence Luis Michelena's Pre-Basque is a bit different from Larry Trask's Pre-Basque, which in turn is quite different from John Bengtson's Proto-Basque (which might represent an older stage of the same language, judging from the phonotactic restrictions Trask described in his etymological dictionary).So, the table should be totally "scholar-neutral", showing ONLY the correspondences WITHOUT attempting to reconstruct proto-phonemes or to ascribe specific phonological features to them.

The claimer was Eliseo Gil (then director of the Veleia site excavations), whereas M. Rius was the person consulted on the Egyptian inscriptions. As this means nothing on the alleged Basque inscriptions IMHO all the mention to her and the note/reference should be deleted from this article.I quote from a recent paper: "El equipo de Eliseo Gil adelantó parte de sus hallazgos el 8 de junio de 2006 "--Dilvish 10 words (talk) 13:05, 22 December 2008 (UTC)Right now the article still states "However the whole finding has come under serious question, even to the point of tarnishing Rius's scholarly pedigree." and gives  as reference. Should this be changed as well? AxelBoldt (talk) 16:04, 22 December 2008 (UTC): I do think so, as this is on the "alleged" Egyptian inscriptions (for which the Veleia team asked to M. Rius, and ''they'' said she is an egyptologist) and on the Latin inscriptions with the name Nefertiti. It's an interview to an egyptologist (Prof. Moreno), so the data has nothing to do with the Basque language.:Unfortunately the copy of Gorrochategui's and Lakarra's reports seems to have been deleted from internet and, although I saved a copy, it's now an unpublished text.:A better link could be  (Alicia Canto is a University Professor and epigraphist) where there are reference to the "official" reports and many quotes to newspapers or this one from a newspaper  or [Los expertos concluyen que los grafitos en euskara del siglo III son 'totalmente falsos' ].:But as the inscriptions seem to be definitely a fake, probably sooner or later all the paragraph on the Veleia Basque inscriptions will be deleted.

It is clearly an isolate if you accept that all lects are varieties of a single language, which is generally the case. There are lots of "isolates" which may be considered small families, depending on how you classify their dialects (Yapen, Nambikwara, Japanese, etc). That is just the language/dialect debate, and doesn't diminish the huge gap that exists between them and other languages. And every isolate belongs to a family, albeit a family of one. kwami (talk) 11:36, 28 February 2009 (UTC):But I think "Vasconic languages",anyway , is more appropriate.How many Basque,say ,"variants" have existed before the Batua compilation?

Are Indo-Europeans the center of the world?I read that some languages are defined as pre-Indo-European once and again.  But, IMHO, this is a clear mistake as it is not  a linguistic classification, as language are not divided in Indo-European and not Indo-European. It is an ethnocentric definition, coming from outdated invasion theories in which there is only a subject in the languages history: the expansion of Indo-European languages over the substrata.It is like saying that Irish is pre-English. Or in Alexander the Great conquest, Semitic language (as Arab) were pre-Indoeuropan; in Medieval Spain Arab was post-Indo-European, but pre-Spanish, English a post-Latin, Latin a pre-English, etc. etc.. Just to put it clear (in a big exageration) it is like saying that Apache is a pre-Caucasian race people.BTW: In fact there is no data to know if there was an Indo-European substratum or not in the land where Basque is spoken today. I am not claiming that there do were Indo-Europeans before, I am only stating that we know nothing about (as, for example, Etruscan is likely to be post-Indo-European in Italy; and Hugarian obviously is), and so that the pre-Indoeuropean terminology it is not only a linguistic absurd, but an unproven hypothesis. --Dumu Eduba (talk) 16:03, 5 May 2009 (UTC):That the Indo-European languages did not originate in Western or Central Europe is a fact.  They came from somewhere else and moved into the rest of Europe.  Therefore, it is unambiguous what the term "pre-Indo-European" means in this context and it is not a genetic classification, but a historical timeframe.  Basque is, indeed, the only language still spoken in Europe that predates the arrival of the Indo-European languages.  (Taivo (talk) 16:33, 5 May 2009 (UTC))::My point is that saying that a language is pre-IndoEuropean has no sense at all.::On what is fact or what is not: any proof that Basque was spoken in West Europe before the Indo-European languages?::I have no problem if people prefer to keep a non scientific and very doubious term as "pre-Indo-European" , especially as that phrasing assumes that we know something that we do not know, but it deservers a warning. The assert is as unambiguous as irrelevant (I beg perdon for the joke, but it is as saying: it is the only Western language who begings with the letters BA-; yes it is a bad joke, but I hope that it states my oppinion).::I am simply tired of this habit of using Indo-European as a measure for everything. Some people may think that the label pre-Indoeuropean is a honour for the Basque language, I think that to define a language according to other languages and not by itself is not exactly an honour. If editors believe that definition to be good, keep (as you wish), I am only oppinating that it is a clear mistake that it is a assert as good as the example of 'featherless biped' by Aristotle. But it is only my oppinion, of course. --Dumu Eduba (talk) 17:16, 5 May 2009 (UTC):::But what makes Basque intriguing is precisely this point. It attests to a historical diversity in Europe that is not otherwise preserved; IE is pretty much the norm in Europe now, so that even the Hungarians and Finns feel somewhat out of place linguistically. Non-IE langs such as Maltese are no big deal, since they're recent introductions.:::Taivo, I do wonder about your statement that the introduction of Finno-Ugric is recent. In Hungary, yes, but even Khanty and Mansi lie within Europe. kwami (talk) 17:39, 5 May 2009 (UTC)::::It depends on how far east you want to draw the line.  Khanty and Mansi are ''east'' of the Urals, so they are outside Europe.  Most English speakers think of "Europe" as being the non-Soviet part of Europe.  Few people realize that the actual geographic center of Europe is within the borders of ''Ukraine''.  Most of the Finno-Ugric literature I've read has the Finnic branch spreading west out of the Urals.  So it all depends on the common perception of where the eastern edge of Europe is.  (Taivo (talk) 22:01, 5 May 2009 (UTC))I don't see a problem with the term. It has scientific relevance, it denotes linguistic (and to some extent cultural) continuity for a certain timespan for example. In Western Europe, using IE or non-IE as a comparative yardstick is acceptable. The Hadza language for example sticks out for being non-Bantu in a sea of Bantu, or the Brahui language which is equally surrounded by IE. These are important facts. Akerbeltz (talk) 19:14, 5 May 2009 (UTC):Let it so then. To me it is not a satisfactory definition (something like saying that Basque is a not-transitive, not-tonal, not-isolating...), too subjective, showing what is a absolutely normal language as something odd. For example, in Europe it is more exceptional the English language as being the most isolating language (in its structure Basque has parallels in Europe, but I do not remember any European language as isolating as the English one).:I would prefer to use the pre- prefix only in its historical context (so Aztec was a pre-Hispanic / pre-Spanish culture, but not a pre-Spanish / pre-Hispanic language), or when the language has no other name because is unknown or only known as a substratum (as the Celtic subtratum or the ancient Greek subtratum). But doesn't mind.:The other caveat is that, as a matter of fact, we do not know for sure that the Basque language pre-dates Indoeuropean languages. When we have the first information on a Basque kind of language, we know many Indo-Europeans in West Spain (even in the Basque Country) (an many references claim that Tartessian (in SW Iberia in the VIII c. bC) was an Indo-European language (see [John Koch]'s (University of Wales) 2009 book  ''Tartessian: Celtic in the South-west at the Dawn of History''). Remember also the Etruscan language, for which many experts consider an Aegean origin, when the alleged Italic substratum ("pre-idoeuropean") may be in fact an adstratum. Remember also when the mainstream theory on Basque origin was that it was an Afrasian language akin to Berber (so non European, but rather an African adstratum; although I do not believe this theory, but it is as alive and kicking as the Caucasian theory: you can even find it in Trask p.  ).:I am aware that  I am spliting hairs (looking to details), but maybe (only maybe) the wording should be more careful on these details, as the reader may think that we know data that at the best are more or less probable inductions in an ocean of lack of information.--Dumu Eduba (talk) 10:13, 6 May 2009 (UTC)::Dumu, I'm not sure how you figure we can't say with a fair amount of certainty it's pre-IE. We have a date for IE arriving in Europe and the Aquitanians are mentioned fairly early on in the records by the romans and to some extent the Greeks. Their long-term presence is also backed up by the genetic record.::Fair point about Etruscan etc but the thing is, Basque is the only *surviving* pre-IE language of Western Europe - which makes it unusual enough to merit mentioning. People hone in on things that make something stick out more so than they hone in on commonalities. That's why a lungfish is called a lungfish!::Either way, it's described as non-IE often enough in the wider literature, so I don't think this is something we should spend out energy on. I could do with some help on the Basque dialects page or perhaps bringing Aizkolaritza or one of the other Basque rural sports pages to GA status :) Akerbeltz (talk) 10:48, 6 May 2009 (UTC):::ALl that matters is that we quote reliable/verifiable sources correctly, if they use the term, we should, if they don't, we shouldn't.

Case closed. Regards. --Dumu Eduba (talk) 11:11, 6 May 2009 (UTC)You know, I agree with Dumu a bit. Modern Basque is not "pre-Indo-European" unless it hasn't changed since (Proto-)Indo-European began being spoken. The important information conveyed by the sentence in question is that Basque is a language isolate. Presumably it descends from a non-IE language that was spoken in the Pyrenees region before the arrival of Indo-European speakers, and is in that sense "pre-Indo-European"; some scholarly references call Basque a "pre-Indo-European" language in this way. But others simply use "non-Indo-European", which avoids giving the impression that Basque hasn't changed since primeval times; so I'd prefer to use "non-Indo-European" rather than "pre-Indo-European". --Akhilleus (talk) 02:50, 8 May 2009 (UTC):We could say the only "indigenous non-IE language", at least for W Europe.

(Taivo (talk) 07:02, 8 May 2009 (UTC))::::At least in east Europe it is not an option. There are problems with the Caucasian languages (many families), and of course Uralic, which are known to have been in contact with common Proto-IE and most probably in Europe. I am sure that references can be find on the birth place of the Uralic languages.::::Of course I still think that telling that a language is pre-IE or not IE is more a comment that a definition (as saying that Basque is not a transitive language instead of saying ergative language, but that's another story.... --Dumu Eduba (talk) 12:52, 8 May 2009 (UTC)The Basques are Indo-Europeans in 85% (one of the highest proportion in Europe).

Derbyshire was a very isolated region of what is now England and if it is not the same word it would also be facinating for an analysis of how it could have been "borrowed" in either direction.The Derbyshire phrase could of course have an origin far predating the use of "Old English" in the area of Derbyshire.Compagnero (talk) 17:29, 25 August 2009 (UTC):Chance coincidence.

Something that's hardly the case with English, German or Russian. Basque is very unique and not widely known, certainly not widely spoken. But if folks want to keep the article free of such a popular culture reference, that's fine. It's unfortunate that most Americans know nothing of the Basques, or if they do, it's all about ETA and bombs.

We have no evidence it was spoken in any form in Western Europe in 15000 BC, which is what you suggest.--Special:Contributions/80.26.120.40|80.26.120.40 (talk) 21:47, 12 July 2013 (UTC)Are dogon and Basque language related?It would be interesting to include the hypothesis that the Basque language proceeds from Dogon.

User:СЛУЖБА|twitter.com/YOMALSIDOROFF (User talk:СЛУЖБА|talk) 23:38, 19 May 2013 (UTC):Good question. I don't know and a cursory glance through the literature doesn't come up with anything either. A bit of  on Google Scholar seems to point at the 1920/30s as the first (cf the roundabout mention as Basque being non IE in ''Three Etymologies in Early Celtic'' by LH Gray) period in which Basque is bandied around as non-IE but that's just based on what Google has in it's search engine. But I would say that that's probably right for the first period in which the scientific community considered the idea. I think the general notion that Basque is very alien to IE has probably been around for a long time, as it's obvious even to the casual observer. Akerbeltz (talk) 14:06, 20 May 2013 (UTC)::Depends ... early Roman scholars recognized it, but they were not scientific by today's standards. HammerFilmFan (talk) 20:55, 24 July 2013 (UTC):::Hammer, that wasn't the question. In order to recognise Basque as not being IE, the concept of IE as a linguistic family had to be recognised first and that didn't happen until the 20th century. Akerbeltz (talk) 11:05, 25 July 2013 (UTC)Issue with coherencyUnder the second example in the grammar section (you buy the newspapers), the descriptions of didzidazue or whatever don't match up very well.  They should be closer to duplicates of one another.  Also, niri isn't introduced until explained in the following parapraph, which is confusing.I recommend putting niri in the pronunciation link, and changing the the breakdown descpription.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/200.28.183.166|200.28.183.166 (talk) 19:19, 17 September 2013 (UTC);; ;;Further reading and external linksSo it looks like we have to have a discussion about those sections.

I'll get to France eventually. Thargor Orlando (talk) 19:28, 31 December 2013 (UTC)Phonostatistical researchI've not removed or tagged it but this new section worries me. If I google "phonostatistical" on Google Scholar, I mostly get stuff by the same author, Tambovtsev, and on the whole, it does not seem a widely used technique. Intuitively, it would worry me as a scientific technique as it compares surface phenomena and, reading the article, seems to have made little or no effort to filter for known loanwords which would, given the relatively small corpus, skew the output. It's a bit like trying to grade the relationship between insects based on leg thickness and wing length - interesting but not obviously meaningful.I don't think this clears WP:PSTS but does anyone have other thoughts?

Talgatov (talk) 12:34, 19 July 2015 (UTC):::I think it's bordering on pseudo-science, I'm afraid. Many techniques in science can be applied in other areas and give us interesting insights but that has to be done with great care and sensitivity to the subject areas in question. To begin with, as I already stated, comparing such phonetic corpora MUST filter out known loanwords in all languages being compared. There seems to have been no effort at doing so. Given the small corpus, the presence of common Romance borrowings in Basque and, for the same of argument, Chinese loanwords in Korean (which are *very* common, between ~20% (speech) and 60% (overall count), which is very bad news for such a project) will skew the result. He's also comparing modern sound inventories rather than the earliest known inventories. For example, modern Basque has  but we know this is an innovation which was not present in older forms of Basque. This will make Basque seem x degrees closer to Ainu which has  too. There also seems no effort at differentiating initial, medial and final position. There is also NO indication that they actually compared phonemes across all these languages as opposed to letters - some of the languages involve rather complex letter-to-sound rules. And last but not least, it is FULL of typos which doesn't fill me with confidence either in the author or the publication which allowed such careless mistakes to be published. Akerbeltz (talk) 12:50, 19 July 2015 (UTC)::::Thanks for your appreciation on this issue. Interesting publication, but it's rather still in a baby-phase. I thinks it need more attention by other scientists, too, be it inter- or intradisciplinary. With regards.
