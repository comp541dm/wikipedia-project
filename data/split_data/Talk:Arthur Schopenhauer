October 31, 2014Article needs to cite sources!The sections of the article that discuss Schopenhauer's views mostly do not cite sources from his works.This is not okay.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/174.31.226.180|174.31.226.180 (talk) 20:51, 24 August 2013 (UTC);; ;;Schopenhauer "influenced thinkers .... Hitler (10) ...".First it is a curious news, that Hitler was a "Thinker".Second, by what idea did Hitler refer to Schopenhauer.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/213.162.68.107|213.162.68.107 (talk) 10:44, 10 November 2014 (UTC);;; ;;Neither does the "cited" source classify Hitler as a THINKER nor can it be deemed possible for anybody with a sane mind to spread such a hideous monstrosity. This is downright intolerable and had to be removed. --Greenforester (talk) 19:06, 21 November 2014 (UTC)There is an edit war going on, because someone really re-established Hitler as "thinker". For a NAZI, Hitler will forever be a thinker, for sure. However, the cited source (Sluga) does not call him a "thinker". So, where is the source? In the brain of the contributor who pops Adolf Hitler constantly up between thinkers? That should not be sufficient, or else en.Wikipedia.org would better close down forever. Greenforester (talk) 23:38, 13 December 2014 (UTC):The Adolf Hitler page doesn't indicate he is an influence, so it seems inappropriate to mention him in the lead here. --John (User:Jwy/talk) 00:05, 14 December 2014 (UTC)::D'accord! Your opinion stands to reason, so there is hope that Adolf Hitler will never again make his disgusting apparition within information on Schopenhauer. Greenforester (talk) 00:52, 14 December 2014 (UTC):::To be clear, just because he would be a "disgusting apparition" on the page is not a reason to keep him off it, disappointing as that might be.  --John (User:Jwy/talk) 03:34, 14 December 2014 (UTC)Section removalsToday I removed 2 sections that appeared as essays. They were based on primary sources thus giving no way to trace their origin. The entire Thought section appears to be written in the same vein ; with the same MO. It is also bloated and lacks clarity for the average reader. Any suggestions on improvement? ~ Alcmaeonid (talk) 05:35, 10 January 2015 (UTC)I think the philosopher had a dog, not a catHi. I indeed would prefer Schopenhauer had had a cat, but actually he had a dog, and it was named Atma. I think he had two dogs, both of them named Atma. In the article we read he had a cat. Hence my point. Thanks.Non-existent pet catIn the “Life” section, the following appeared: “He died of heart failure on 21 September 1860 while sitting at home on his couch with his cat.” Helen Zimmern’s biography was cited. I deleted the reference to a cat. Zimmern’s  does not mention a cat. By the way, Schopenhauer’s pet was a poodle, not a cat. He provided for the poodle in his will. Also, the first poodle was Atma; the second was named Butz.Special:Contributions/98.110.87.71|98.110.87.71 (talk) 05:15, 9 August 2015 (UTC)Hans WurstPlease Try Harder PeopleEncyclopedias have higher standards of veracity than "folk-wisdom", people.Schopenhauer was NOT an "atheist" - I spit and coughed and choked on my drink, merely reading such idiocy.Socrates was an "atheist", too, right?Schopenhauer rejected the Judaic conception of God as a tribal self-projection of delusory egoism, morally and rationally bankrupt. Rejection of the Jewish God does NOT constitute, in some sort of simplistic moronic distortion, "atheism" IN ITSELF -Schopenhauer, as a penetrating thinker, is not stereotyped in conceptual demotic boxes lacking subtlety.Schopenhauer is paradoxical, and admits paradox as the actual height of perception in human terms - do people READ HIS WORKS THESE DAYS? - do people not notice how Schopenhauer praises *mystical* and *apophatic* or *negative theological* philosophers and their notions of the Godhead...?Jewish theism, if the paradigm we are bound to place him within forcibly, is only where pure dull ATHEIST, simple cut-and-dry, applies to Schopenhauer as a label.Schopenhauer endlessly favorably expounds upon and comments in laudation about CERTAIN CONCEPTIONS OF THE GODHEAD - Hindu, Christian mystical, Sufi, Gnostic - do you guys read his actual books, may I ask? Or just accept book-store platitudes and nonsense passively?To be precise, Schopenhauer approbates and celebrates glowingly the mystical Christian tradition and the personal representatives of philosophically sophisticated mystic-transcendentalist APOPHATICISM or the "via negativa", "negative theology"...I just randomly opened "The World as..." simply to guide you guys... Here..."In recent times Christianity has forgotten its true meaning and degenerated into banal optimism"...Wow, strange statement coming from an anti-Christian "ATHEIST"... Contemporary academics attempt to paint their own vulgar selves onto a noble figure such as Schopenhauer and sneakily toss around ambiguously meaningless terminology in order to hide their own lack of Schopenhauer-like intelligence...Flipped randomly some pages... Well, what do you know, the anti-Christian atheist Schopenhauer is again positively commending the mystical Christian tradition and its nobler conceptions of spiritual metaphysics... Hmm...Angelus Silesius Schopenhauer practically gushes over...as an esoteric Christian mystic not beholden to idiotic Arabian anthropomorphic distortions of the idea of God... Look up Silesius (countless other authentic sages too) in your indexes if you have Schopenhauer's actual books (optimistically?) -Silesius is designated "admirable" and "immeasurably deep", then the "ATHEIST" (derp!) cites Silesius on God favorably... Immediately thereafter, Schopenhauer opines Meister Eckhart is "a yet greater mystic", a whole nice passage about the meaning of God in relation to man this "ATHEIST" strangely allows into his erudition...I could do this ALL NIGHT. Remove the horribly moronic, misleading term "ATHEIST" from the introductory summary, please - academic integrity is offended here... Does one call Dionysius the Areopagite an "ATHEIST" because he described God as incommunicable, negatively partially conceivable only as "ABSYM" and "BEDAZZLING DIVINE DARKNESS"? Ugh, is there any standard of I.Q. on Wikipedia?I can't even endure reading the rest of this, as an actual student of Schopenhauer actually knowledgeable about his actual philosophical tendencies...Ha, "atheist". You could have hit a little closer with the oh so new trendy "panentheist" or "trans-theist" - any Hindu deific label - anything except ATHEIST! Modern Marxist pseudo-intellectuals, entrenched in establishment educational media, WISH Schopenhauer was some empty-skulled, garden-variety rationalistic atheist of the low level of mind of Marx and co., in their dreams. No, no, no. Barf. Fallacious simplistic distortion of a vastly more multi-leveled reality, please...  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/2602:304:B34B:A940:201B:C69D:8184:5993|2602:304:B34B:A940:201B:C69D:8184:5993 (talk) 06:38, 22 February 2015 (UTC);;; ;;Here, for the rare open-minded seekers of reality here:Not perfect as an article, but at least is a beginner's guide in this territory and should help people discuss S. a little less ignorantly...  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/2602:304:B34B:A940:201B:C69D:8184:5993|2602:304:B34B:A940:201B:C69D:8184:5993 (talk) 06:58, 22 February 2015 (UTC);;; ;;Vedantic horse feathersThe section on the supposed similarity to Buddhism should be dropped unless it can be shown that Schopenhauer himself made the comparison. Otherwise it's just some religious posturing, ie, trying to attach one's own religion to a famous philosopher so as bask in a little reflected glory or, alternatively, to tarnish the thinker by claiming that his insights actually come from someplace else. It adds nothing to our understanding of the man, thus, I will delete in one week if no-one objects.Theonemacduff (talk) 14:58, 7 July 2015 (UTC):If it is well sourced that others have recognized a parallel in Vedic thinking, I believe this is a useful insight into both Schopenhauer and the ancient Indian thinkers - with no detriment to either party.  --John (User:Jwy/talk) 18:49, 7 July 2015 (UTC)
