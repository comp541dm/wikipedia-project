I think this page should probably be renamed.  After all, it's part of the Jewish canon as well.----Actually, I was inclined to make it more specific, since it'sthe King James Version of Genesis in the Christian bible.----Well, only if we propose to have the full texts of several different Bibles.  But then we'd still need a nondenominational page to discuss the book of Genesis.  Hmmm....not an easy problem to solve right away...----I agree completely with what everyone has said.  Especially the part about it not being an easy problem to solve right away.  :-)----Y'know, it wouldn't be hard at all to come up with a perl scriptthat would place the full text of the bible on the wiki.  But do we want to be Project Gutenberg as well as an encyclopedia?
