'''ArgoUML''' is an UML diagramming application written in Java and released under the open source Eclipse Public License.  By virtue of being a Java application, it is available on any platform supported by Java.HistoryArgoUML was originally developed at UC Irvine by Jason E. Robbins, leading to his Ph.D. It is now an open source project hosted by Tigris.org. The ArgoUML project now includes more than 19,000 registered users and over 150 developers.In 2003, ArgoUML won the Software Development Magazine's annual Readers' Choice Award in the “Design and Analysis Tools” category.ArgoUML development has suffered from lack of manpower.
