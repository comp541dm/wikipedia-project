picture of 21 amino acidsFor the aminoacids Arginine, Lysine, Aspartic acid, and Glutamic acid the pictures given are for their corresponding ions. Protonated Arginine, Lysine and deprotonated Aspartic acid,  Glutamic acid are given. This is very confusing for various reasons. For the first two cases at least the zwitterionic form can be presented, in this case the carboxyl proton should be removed. It would be nice if some one edits the picture and provides the neutral form of the amino acids.   — Preceding unsigned comment added by Kitkarson (talk • Special:Contributions/Kitkarson|contribs) 13:11, 22 May 2013 (UTC);;; ;;non-standard aasThere is a problem in the section "non-standard amino acids": If the term "standard" applies to 22 aa's then it includes serenocysteine and pyrrolysine. The section needs to be re-written. I am tempted to say standard=20 aa's, as I believe this is still the common usage of this ill-defined term. Akita86 (talk) 21:28, 17 September 2009 (UTC)*I have to second this. It was a bit disconcerting to have read this article before and seen twenty(20) standard amino acids, then a reference to the other two(2) aa's, then it has become twenty-two(22).  This has gone further, to someone editing the article to have twenty-four standard aa's.  I will assume the 'standard' term comes from those used by the ribosome to produce a polypeptide/protein.  Note: the twenty(20) is reinforced by the named list which only has 20 aa's. Special:Contributions/206.116.0.55|206.116.0.55 (talk) 05:57, 19 September 2009 (UTC)::This problem still exists. It is rather strange to see selenocysteine and pyrrolysine listed as standard in one paragraph and as non-standard in the next. The problem rests on whether standard means "naturally occurring in proteins" or "directly encoded by DNA"; the first includes these two, the second excludes them. If there is no objection in the next week or so I will change the article to be consistent. Khajidha (talk) 17:14, 17 December 2009 (UTC)::And this problem still exists! I think that selenocysteine in particular would not be regarded as a 'standard' amino acid by most scholars and rather as a 'non-standard' amino acid. I was very surprised and disappointed to see it referred to here. There are 20 amino acids coded by DNA and these are the 20 that should be included in a general discussion of amino acids. It is misleading to include selenocysteine and pyrrolysine in this article. In it's current form this cannot be regarded as a 'good article' by Wikipedia.

Nevertheless if I were a biochemist I wouldn't be happy to see this article. I've done some more research and need to revise my comments a little. It appears that both selenocysteine and pyrrolysine are encoded by DNA - but only under certain specific conditions, which is why I for one would argue that they should be regarded as 'non-standard'. This distinction ought to be made clear in this and other articles on the subject. It has to be said that the IUPAC has confused the issue by giving these two amino acids lettering  and abbreviations that may imply that they are 'standard'. My copy (1995 Ed) of Lubert Stryer's highly respected textbook on Biochemistry does not include these two amino acids in it's general discussion and so again if biochemists now regard these two as standard, it should be made clear in discussion that their inclusion is a recent development.

Richard001 01:31, 22 July 2007 (UTC):In fact, there are many, many amino acids beyond those encoded by DNA, most of which are generated by post-translational processing of the standard 20 but some that arise from more esoteric biosynthetic processes.  And many other amino acids are synthetic that have been incorporated into proteins or used for various purposes related to engineered enzymes.BCAAThe branched chain amino acid paragraph is a little unusual - the aliphatic/hydrocarbon side chains are often just categorized as aliphatic side chains (Leu, Val, Ile).  I've almost always heard branched amino acids used to refer to the beta-branched amino acids, which include Ile, Thr, and Val. This is a useful category because the branching affects the geometry of the protein backbone immediately surrounding the amino acids, and thus the protein structure. I don't know the history of the page - is there a reason that the branched chain aliphatic category was given precedence?

Antorjal 03:25, 2 August 2007 (UTC):I'll have a look at Chrighton ''Proteins'' when I get into work tomorrow.

Tim Vickers 03:35, 2 August 2007 (UTC)::With that I will agree with you 100%.

The numeric values represent the free energies of transfer of between phases e.g. octanol-water for hydrophobicity and air-water for hydrophilicity as I recall (I don't have a copy of Creighton on hand). Anyhow Trp and Tyr are very hydrophobic but somewhat hydrophilic.  Glycine is not very hydrophobic but not very hydrophilic either.

Zwitterions are mentioned, but almost as an aside.  In reality, amino acids in neutral aqueous solution and in crystalline solid state are zwitterions.  The ratio of zwitterion to neutral at pH 7 is about 10^7 to one. At more acidic pH, the carboxylate becomes protonated, but so is the amino group.  At high pH the amino group is deprotonated, but so is the carboxylate. Nowhere on the pH scale are there significant concentrations of the neutral carboxylic acid and neutral amino group on the same molecule.Special:Contributions/96.54.32.44|96.54.32.44 (talk) 06:52, 16 February 2011 (UTC):It all comes down to convention. Amino acids are very widely depicted in the scientific literature in their neutral forms, and Wikipedia's role is to report on what others write.

Ironically, the structures show aspartate and glutamate with deprotonated side-chain carboxylates despite the fact that the pKa values dictate that alpha-carboxylic acid will deprotonate before the side chain does. There are indeed plenty of sources with all the amino acids in zwitterion form, the only issue being copyright of images.  Most of the amino acids were discovered prior to the formulation of Brønsted-Lowry description of acid/base behaviour, hence older texts adhered to the older convention.

The ions produced at the isoelectric point have both positive and negative charges and are known as a zwitterion, which comes from the German word Zwitter meaning "hermaphrodite" or "hybrid".[19]''"  One could be misled to understand that the zwitterion only occurs at the isoelectric point, whereas it is actually present as the major form from ~pH 2.2 (mean alpha-carboxylic acid pKa) through to ~pH 9.4 (mean pKa of the alpha-ammonium ion). At pH  9.4 the negative ion predominates.:"''Amino acids '''can''' exist as zwitterions in solids and in polar solutions such as water, but not in the gas phase.[20] Zwitterions have minimal solubility at their isolectric point''"  True enough, except the "can" implies other possibilities without specifying what they are. Given all the information presented in the structure figures, one might think that the zwitterion is a special case rather than the major form present.:"''and an amino acid can be isolated by precipitating it from water by adjusting the pH to its particular isoelectric point.''" which is only really true for the hydrophobic amino acids; more polar amino acids reach a minimum point in their pH/solubility curve, but are still relatively quite soluble.What I suggest is a rewrite, dividing into two paragraphs:'''Zwitterions'''The α-amino and carboxylic acid functional groups found in amino acids allow them to have amphiprotic properties.[9] Carboxylic acid groups can be deprotonated to become negative carboxylates, and α-amino groups can be protonated to become positive α-ammonium groups. At pH values greater than the pKa of the carboxylic acid group (mean for the 20 common amino acids is about 2.2, see the table of amino acid structures above), the negative carboxylate ion predominates.  At pH values lower than the pKa of the α-ammonium group (mean for the 20 common α-amino acids is about 9.4) the nitrogen is predominantly protonated as a positively charged α-ammonium group.  Thus at pH between 2.2 and 9.4, the predominant form adopted by α-amino acids contains a negative carboxylate and a positive α-ammonium group as shown in structure (2) on the right, so is net zero charge.  This molecular state is known as a zwitterion, which comes from the German word Zwitter meaning "hermaphrodite" or "hybrid".[19] Below pH 2.2, the predominant form will have a neutral carboxylic acid group and a positive α-ammonium ion (net charge +1), and above pH 9.4, a negative carboxylate and neutral α-amino group (net charge -1). The fully neutral form (structure (1) on the right) is a very minor species in aqueous solution throughout the pH range (less than 1 part in 10^7). Amino acids also exist as zwitterions in the solid phase, and crystallize with salt-like properties unlike typical organic acids or amines.'''Isoelectric point'''At pH values between the two pKa values, the zwitterion predominates, but coexists in dynamic equilibrium with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions.  At the exact midpoint between the two pKa values, the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero.[18] This pH is known as the isoelectric point pI, so pI = (pKa1 + pKa2) / 2.  The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values, so have different isoelectric points.  Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isolectric point and some amino acids (particularly with non-polar side chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point."but not in the gas phase.[20]" Reference cited does not really say this.  It's based on theoretical calculations for certain metal complexes of glycine, so "gas phase" exists as a computational state rather than one that can be experimentally achieved.\Special:Contributions/96.54.32.44|96.54.32.44 (talk) 08:37, 20 February 2011 (UTC)I'm sorry, I don't have any of my basic biochemistry textbooks on hand to cite chapter and verse, but I'm sure you will find this discussed in Metzler, or Creighton, or Lehninger, particularly the old Blue Lehninger (1975) rather than the newer Ouija board versions of "Lehninger". Special:Contributions/96.54.32.44|96.54.32.44 (talk) 08:44, 20 February 2011 (UTC):To me, that looks like an excellent revision.  Many thanks, Walkerma (talk) 03:41, 21 February 2011 (UTC)::Sounds like improvement. "Gas phase" may refer to something observed by Mass spectrometry. Do not forget that isolectric points also depend on the presence of side-chain charge (Arg, Lys, His, Asp, Glu, etc.). Biophys (talk) 20:38, 21 February 2011 (UTC):::Reference (20) discusses transition metal complexes of amino acids, where the amino rather than the ammonium group acts as the ligand, thus metal complex formation significantly alters the normal pKas of the free amino acid. It may be interesting chemistry, but is straying far away from typical biochemical behaviour of the amino acids. Mass spec, as far as I know, always deals in ions so that they can be accelerated and deflected by electric and magnetic fields and detected by deposition of charge at the detecting anode. In conventional mass spec, amino acids are usually derivatized to enhance their volatility. Gas phase infra-red spectroscopy should be able to tell the difference between zwitterion and neutral molecule, but I'm not aware of any literature on the topic.:::I did not go into the isoelectric points of amino acids with charged side chains in order to keep things straightforward, but if you like they could be included, as in following paragraph:'''Isoelectric point'''At pH values between the two pKa values, the zwitterion predominates, but coexists in dynamic equilibrium with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions.  At the exact midpoint between the two pKa values, the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero.[18] This pH is known as the isoelectric point pI, so pI = ½(pKa1 + pKa2).  The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values, so have different isoelectric points. For amino acids with charged side chains, the pKa of the side chain is involved.  Thus for Asp,  Glu with negative side chains, pI = ½(pKa1 + pKaR), where pKaR is the side chain pKa. Cysteine also has potentially negative side chain with pKaR = 8.14, so pI should be calculated as for Asp and Glu, even though the side chain is not significantly charged at neutral pH. For His, Lys and Arg with positive side chains, pI = ½(pKaR + pKa2). Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isolectric point and some amino acids (particularly with non-polar side chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point.:::Then of course, I could add an explanation of why the particular pKas are chosen for calculation of pI and so on.  I personally prefer the simpler version but either would do.

Also, double bonds are treated as 2 bonds to the same atom.Therefore, C=OO counts as having 3 oxygen atoms and thus has a priority of 3*8 or 24. The side chain has a sulphur and 2 hydrogens, giving a priority of 2*1+16 or 18. This is still well below the 24 of the carboxyl group, and thus the carboxyl group has a higher priority, and thus the L form should still be the S form, not the R form.The one which the L form is the R form is selenocysteine, which has selenium in the place of sulfur, giving that chain a priority of 32+2 or 34, making it higher than the carboxyl group. Unless I get a satisfactory explanation, I will change it in a week (and on its page).  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/149.171.197.22|149.171.197.22 (talk) 01:48, 16 August 2011 (UTC);; ;;:The primary CIP priority check is highest one attachment, not the total of all attachments (check Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules#Assignment of priorities #1).

The lede poorly delineates these so it's wrong in too many places ("amino acids serve as the building blocks of proteins"? Not in my textbook. Some do, some don't; if it means the 21-or-is-it-22-who-knows proteinogenic amino acids it doesn't say clearly and the wiki title is about amino acids generally, so it's incorrect). We also never find out if "standard", "alpha-amino" or "proteinogenic" amino acids are the same thing or if not their differences (sources differ), so we are left to guess the differences and which one the lede means at any point it discusses "amino acids" without a qualifier.What a mess. I'm going to try and clean it. Can someone check I got it right, fix or add good cites, and not be too hard on me if it's not perfect.

The lede of an article like this should be at least broadly accessible to an intelligent high school student.  A high school student shouldn't necessarily be able to understand all of it, but should at least come away with a clear grasp of the most essential facts, which as I see it are (1) proteins are chains of amino acids; (2) an amino acid consists of a central carbon atom with four things attached to it:  an H, an amine group, an acid group, and a variable "payload"; (3) amino acids can be chained together by means of peptide bonds, which bind the amine group of one to the acid group of another.  Concerning cites, my feeling is that for basic textbook material of this sort they are not so essential -- they are crucial if something comes into dispute, but otherwise it is more important to be correct and understandable than to have everything rigorously sourced.  In many Wikipedia articles the convention is that things in the lede don't need to be cited at all -- they should be repeated in more detail in the body, and cited there. Regards, Looie496 (talk) 03:33, 9 September 2012 (UTC):: The cites explanation reassures me. It should be accurate too, the old one was wrong because it didn't do what the page says.

I tried, that's the minimum it comes down to. It's a big topic, those 12 cover it.  PS The lede was happy to spend 30 words on how big side-chains are but not mention amino acids act as neurotransmitters.

I realize that they are ambiguous, and almost always conform to R and S, but as a non-chemist I would like to understand what utility they have in biochemistry. Specifically, I don't get the supposed correspondence to D- and L- isomers of glyceraldehyde - what am I missing? lifeform (talk) 22:20, 1 May 2014 (UTC):Whatever terminology one uses to identify them, the chemical fact is that there are two different 3D geometric forms: they are mirror images of each other (like your hands are the same as each other in terms of local shape, finger order, knuckle direction, etc. except for being completely opposite as whole objects. Most biological molecules have this property, including amino acids (and by extension the proteins made from them) and the enzymes and other molecules that bind to them. If the AA has two forms and the enzyme has two forms, there is a "matched" and a "mismatched" pairing (like putting your left and right gloves on correctly or getting them mixed up). Only one way works, because the other way the AA doesn't fit right (either it doesn't fit at all, or it winds up forming a mis-shapen or non-functional complex). So once you have one AA or enzyme, it requires the "right" binding partner, which means other things that bind to it must also match, which means other things that bind to ''that'' must match ''it'', etc etc, and suddenly we wind up with virtually every case of a given class of molecules having the same left or right form so that they all can inter-operate.:Glyceraldehyde is another example of a molecule that has two geometric forms (the technical term for them is "stereoisomer"s, or more specifically, "enantiomers"). For consistency, scientists like to use the same terminology as much as possible, or at least in many analogous cases. For whatever reason, D/L had been used to identify the two different enantiomers of glyceraldehyde so someone said "hey, both of these have a central chiral carbon, with a carbonyl, a single-bonded O/N, an H, and another carbon (with possibly other things beyond that)". Serine is the closest relationship: the only differences are whether the carbonyl is an aldehyde vs acid group, and whether the single-bonded atom is O vs N. DMacks (talk) 01:39, 2 May 2014 (UTC)::Thanks for that, DMacks.

At any pH it is impossible (at least to the best of my knowledge) for a primary amino group to be deprotonated (C-NH2, instead of C-NH3+) and the carboxyl group be protonated (CO2H instead of CO2-). This is primarily because the difference between their pKa's is roughly 5 (the Amino group being ~8 and the Carboxyl group being ~3, which makes the carboxyl group many orders of magnitude more acidic, and thus, prone to lose a proton), which means short of some very extenuating circumstances there should be no circumstance in which the carboxyl group is protonated and the amino group is not. As such I would suggest all renditions be replaced with either the zwitterion (NH3+ and CO2-) form found typically at pH of 7, or the fully protonated, or fully deprotonated forms as the standard across the pages.This problem I have found is present in literally every one of your pages on the 20 amino acids (, , etc.) and the primary landing page for the amino acids in general (This problem is in the chemical formula, structure drawings, and computerized renditions in the system. As such I would like to request either that they all be fixed, or that I be informed as to why they are correct and I am not.;/blockquote;This chemical analysis is correct (and may even be more complicated for cases where the sidechain is also able to be protonated or deprotonated). This is in agreement with, for example, Amino acid#Zwitterions in the article (compare to the lede-thumb image that is explicitly identified as "un-ionized form", suggesting that this detail is somehow noteworthy about the diagram). I just checked a few chem/biochem textbooks, and they often do represent them in the zwitterionic form, especially when discussing chemical behavior. However, they also do sometimes use "each site neutral" diagrams (some books often, some only occasionally). That's in keeping with the names "amino" and "acid" (the non-ionized groups) vs for example "ammonium" and "carboxylate". IUPAC doesn't seem to define "amino acid" itself, but the White Book (formally from IUBMB, linked from the IUPAC Gold Book) does have "[amino-acid residue in a polypeptide]", which uses solely the neutral groups when discussing these sections of them (a polypeptide is a multi-component chain that still runs from an amino on one end to an acid on the other).Looking into wider reference material, I am often seeing them as all-neutral, for example,  (and every one of its catalog entries for the individual chemicals). I checked the links to external databases in the alanine infobox, and every one exclusively uses diagrams and terminology for the all-neutral form.Wikipedia:WikiProject Chemicals set the standard of representing all sorts of chemicals in their neutral forms in general (including amino acids and other acid–base mixtures). I can't find the formal guideline itself, but .
