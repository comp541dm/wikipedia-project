While at the ''Times'' Hesser wrote about the influence of Costco on the wine industry, uncovered the politics behind the New York City Greenmarket and was among the first to write about Ferran Adria of El Bulli in a major American publication.Hesser was involved in two cases of conflict of interest while working at the ''Times''. In 2004, she awarded the restaurant Spice Market a three-star rating without disclosing that the year before, the restaurant’s owner, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, had provided a complimentary jacket blurb for her book ''Cooking for Mr. Latte''. In 2007, Hesser published a favorable review of ''Vegetable Harvest'' by Patricia Wells, without noting that in 1999, Wells had provided a jacket blurb for Hesser’s book ''The Cook and the Gardener''.
