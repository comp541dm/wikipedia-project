Then there should be a general article that gives the things common to all these small bodies, and some sort of classification of them. At the moment it's true that the information is spread over a number of articles in a haphazard way. Part of the problem in the past was that "asteroid" turns out to be poorly defined — it is sometimes used as a name for any small object that is not a comet ("small solar system body", with a few exceptions, then), other times refers only to the ''rocky'' small bodies that orbit closer to the sun than Jupiter. From what I've seen the second meaning is what is mostly used among astronomers, so asteroid should talk about only these rocky bodies. As for an overall article, a reasonable solution, I think, would be to keep only one of small solar system body and minor planet. Any things in those that refer specifically to "asteroids" or other groups would then be moved out into their appropriate more restricted articles.:In short, I would say that the articles should be kept (except perhaps for deleting one of small solar system body or minor planet), but sizeable portions of text should be shifted around, (e.g. out of minor planet). I'm not all that optimistic about a resolution of this though ;-(  — cleanups have been suggested several times already. Deuar 08:35, 11 October 2007 (UTC)::Yeah, as I've been looking into this more I've been finding out just how loosely and inconsistently these terms have been used throughout their history, so I'm not surprised that previous cleanup attempts have met with problems.  There's the added complication that common usage doesn't necessarily follow technical usage (which is why several of my initial suggestions involve using Asteroid for disambiguation rather than the more technically correct Minor planet.)  I don't think this is a hopeless cause however, nor should it really require that much (human) effort.  I think a central page explaining the nomenclature issues (including the vagueness and historical inconsistencies and changes) could be linked to from the top of each of the related articles, and that would serve to tie them together and let them ''all'' act as disambiguation pages for each other, in a way.  I'd say the differences between Minor planet and Asteroid that are most relevant to each article are those differences themselves (and not the things both have in common) and so highlighting the terminology in the intro makes sense.  Once that framework is in place, I think it should be easier to move material between the articles in a way that makes sense, and which can be done gradually over time.  --Sapphic 16:22, 11 October 2007 (UTC):::Sounds like a good plan to me. Deuar 09:46, 12 October 2007 (UTC)It amazes me that people would seriously entertain the idea of merging asteroid and minor planet! Ask anyone on the street, "What killed the dinosaurs?" Are they are likely to tell you, "A minor planet"? Of course not! How utterly pedantic to think that, because asteroids are minor planets, or vice versa, there must be just one article. Shall we eliminate the article on Africa because it is a continent? Or, more to the point, shall we eliminate the article on "house", because it is just a common, vulgar, term for the much more correct "domicile"? This reminds me of the tiresome argument over the use of the term "organic", as in "organic food" versus "organic chemistry"--the nerds always claim some imagined, exclusive right to the word; "...it must be a hydrocarbon...!", but the term "organic farming" has its own right to existence independent of the narrow limits such people would impose on it. English would be a dreary language indeed if the minor planet exclusivists had their way! And I have nothing against minor planets--it is term with meaning and usefulness. Is there overlap? Of course! Anyone making elimination of overlapping information their top priority should be banned from Wikipedia, in my opinion. I propose that the merge template should removed, and I may do it myself sometime soon.Taquito1 (talk) 19:29, 12 January 2008 (UTC)Since the 2006 definition, "minor planet" has effectively become a historical term. The new three-tiered division which recognises planets, dwarf planets and small solar system bodies eliminates the need for minor planets altogether. "Minor planet" is not synonymous with "small solar system body"; the term encompasses dwarf planets, whereas SSSB does not. Therefore, I think the tidiest idea would be to merge minor planet with asteroid, and keep asteroid as the main article.

Hello dear asteroid Pluto! Nergaal (talk) 12:12, 19 May 2008 (UTC)*This is a tricky one because the terminology is such a muddle. Whichever way we do it, I think we must keep Asteroid as a contentful article, and not make it a redirect to some relatively obscure term. Joe Public has heard of asteroids, and he's going to expect to find an article about them on Wikipedia.

Not all SSSBs are asteroids.  The icy bodies in the outer solar system which are more cometary in composition, but their orbits will not let them display a coma.  This group of minor planets is subject to a redefinition that would mean they are no longer asteroids.  Keeping a limited article discussing the out-of-date term and doubling as disambiguation page.  There was a prior discussion of what the minor planet article should be.  I think minor planet, as it stands, fills its role nicely.   I think this arrangement can withstand future IAU definitions. I don't see the need for change.  As an alternative, create a section in Asteroid discussing the term "minor planet" and how it relates to "asteroid".  Minor planet would redirect to that section. Novangelis (talk) 03:07, 22 May 2008 (UTC)*Looking at this some more, it seems to me that we need to decide whether the terms "asteroid" and "minor planet" are or are not synonymous. The very first sentence of Asteroid says in big letters that they are, in which case there is no need for two articles, and, I suggest, Minor planet should be merged to Asteroid#Terminology (which already covers similar ground). However, Minor planet implies that there ''is'' a difference. It says that centaurs are minor planets but not asteroids, even though Centaur itself says "The centaurs are a class of icy planetoids (or asteroids)". Minor planet also says that TNOs are minor planets but not asteroids. If the consensus is that "minor planet" is different from "asteroid" then the two articles should remain separate -- but the Asteroid article needs to stop claiming that they are the same thing.

Further observations by ground telescopes revealed three bodies. The Hubble telescope uncovered 10 objects, each with dusty tails. The four largest fragments are up to 656 feet across. Scientists say the asteroid began coming apart early last year. They theorize sunlight is slowing pulling the asteroid apart by increasing its rotation.

It seems to switch topic right in the middle, making it very ambiguous.: Asteroids are minor planets, especially those of the inner Solar System. The larger ones have also been called planetoids. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not show the disc of a planet and was not observed to have the characteristics of an active comet, ''but as minor planets in the outer Solar System were discovered, they were often distinguished from traditional asteroids. Their'' [the outer Solar System objects?] ''volatile-based surfaces were found to resemble comets. They'' [the outer Solar System objects that aren't outer bodies? huh?] ''are grouped with the outer bodies—centaurs, Neptune trojans, and trans-Neptunian objects—as minor planets, which is the term preferred in astronomical circles.''

Here's the reference - Norwikian (talk) 20:56, 1 June 2015 (UTC):Even if one believed it were true, it is about a predicting a meteorite fall, not discovering an orbiting asteroid. Rmhermen (talk) 21:03, 1 June 2015 (UTC)::Also requires a secondary source. Merely interpreting an ancient document is original research (OR). Geogene (talk) 21:05, 1 June 2015 (UTC)Predicting a meteorite fall would be no small achievement if true ! In 1675 Pliny's Latin account was translated into English as 'a large stone',  while ' Recent data released by NASA reveals that the Earth is struck by a small asteroid, one meter or larger, on an average of every two weeks'.( Source: World Asteroid Day page). I suggest you both actually read the paragraph cited in its entirety before hastily dismissing, paying particular attention to the words 'as bigge as a waine (wagon) load, carrying a burnt and adust colour, at what time as a comet or blazing starre also burned in those nights'. Pliny also dates it as being in the 2nd year of the 78th Olympiad which might assist in identifying this astronomical event. -  Its a common failing by 'Moderns' to dismiss the science of antiquity. Norwikian (talk) 21:38, 1 June 2015 (UTC):We need a reliable secondary source. Geogene (talk) 21:52, 1 June 2015 (UTC):He wasn't the earliest writer - and this material belong at Meteorite and meteorite fall. See  which discusses several known meteorites earlier than Pliny.

Not really sure how it fits in this article past that... feel free to suggest specific language for the article if you think it needs to be more prominent. Thanks, --'''User talk:ElHef|El;/font;Hef;/font;'''(Special:Contributions/ElHef|Meep?;/font;);14:43, 19 June 2015 (UTC)::Just as a note, I think there's a lot of recent odd activity related to the Asteroid Day article that looks like a burst of paid/COI promotionalism. I suggest denying any future requests like this one unless it is particularly well sourced. Geogene (talk) 17:07, 19 June 2015 (UTC)Asteroid 2005 BS1Asteroid 2005 BS1 has a diameter of 52 feet and a 0 sigma impact with odds of impact 1 in 100,000.  Will it hit the Earth on January 14, 2016?Bsmath1 (talk) 00:42, 15 October 2015 (UTC):[2005 BS1] has a pathetic 3 day observation arc. At roughly  in diameter, it is NOT a serious threat. The odds of impact for this small object are only 1 in 12,000 on 2016-01-14. If it impacted over an ocean it is likely only infrasound detectors would notice. -- Kheider (talk) 02:02, 15 October 2015 (UTC)Naming in block capitalsI have a general question about the naming of asteroids (I'm not an astronomer).The name of "8210 NANTEN" is written like that, in block capitals. But this is obviously a confusion: in Japanese it is very normal to use only capitals for anything written in lower-case letters, for all sorts of reasons, not the least of which is the [descender problem]. Also many Japanese writers appear not to know the general rule of ''italicising'' foreign words, and seem to think that BLOCK CAPITALS have the same effect (at least for Japanese words). This ''Nanten'' is ultimately named after the Japanese for "southern sky" (南天), but apparently through an intermediate telescope, also called (by the same confusion) "NANTEN" . I see no reason why the erroneous capitalization should be preserved, and I honestly doubt whether anyone doing the original copying even thought carefully about why it was in block capitals; but I ask in case this has been thrashed out somewhere, and a decision made that discoverers have not only the right to name the celestial body, but also to insist on anomalous capitalisation. (I found a number of other names in block capitals, but they are all valid acronyms.) Imaginatorium (talk) 09:42, 25 October 2015 (UTC)Why is Olbers omitted?The article on Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers states that he discovered Pallas and Vesta, so I find it strange that he isn't even mentioned in the list of asteroid hunters.
