I presume this goes back in time long before BD.  I don't know if there is a similar tradition in the USA.  I'm not suggesting that this is the origin of the BD beat, but it does imply that the rhythm is a fairly natural one, and not necessarily of African origin.Special:Contributions/86.173.167.113|86.173.167.113 (talk) 14:34, 8 July 2012 (UTC):It's mentioned in the article.

But after a search on the web, I found this link that says that Bo Diddley tried his hand as a boxer http: //www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/arts/music/03diddley.html?pagewanted=all;_r=0  (Incidentally, this NY Times article cites more derivations of the Bo Diddley name than are included in the Wiki article)As a result I think this is what Ed Roman meant (not necessarily the truth about the Bo Diddley name):Bo Diddley was a boxer at one time but not very good, hence the description 'Golden Gloves boxer'. From this Bo Diddly was given his stage name meaning 'absolutely nothing'. CPES (talk) 16:28, 2 October 2015 (UTC)
