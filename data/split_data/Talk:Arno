UntitledGreat entry! I was meaning to get around to starting it myself, but I was beaten to it. However, "Arno" is a common first name in Europe, and is also an acronym for "Academic Research in the Netherlands Online" (among other possibilites). You might want to rename to entry "Arno river" to avoid any conflicts. maveric149:Still a newbie here, I don't know how to, but I agree :-)It's easy. all you need to do is create a link for the new name in an edit box for the "Arno" page. Specifically, copy all the text for the "Arno" entry, and then at the bottom of the page type in the new title of the page with double brackets in front and behind the name (like so Arno river). Then hit the "Preview" botton, scroll down, find "Arno river?", click on the question mark and paste the text in the new edit window. At that point you can decide what to do with the "Arno" page. I suggest for now we redirect it to the "Arno river" entry. To do that, delete all the text in the "Arno" article and type the following: #REDIRECT Arno river:(diff) Arno river 1:07 am [done :-))) thanks maveric!] . . . . . 151.24.191.xxxNo Problem.
