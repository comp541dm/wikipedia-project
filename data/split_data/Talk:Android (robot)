George Lucas coining the term droid vs. popularizing itIt is generally believed that George Lucas came up with the word Droid, as a contraction of the word Android. While he without a doubt popularized it through the movie Star Wars, he was not the first person who came up with the term. There are multiple examples to be found using Google Books searches, but the clearest is the following one:On page 40 you will find the following line:"And then suppose you were to get a good droid mechanic to convert them[...]"Looking around that same page, you'll find that the droid is without a doubt a reference to an android/robot. The magazine is also a sci-magazine, so it can't be said that Lucas was truly the one to coin the term even in a sci-fi setting. With all that being presented, would it be prudent to change 'coined' to 'popularized' in the article.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by SimmerALPHA (talk • Special:Contributions/SimmerALPHA|contribs) 12:35, 16 October 2014 (UTC);;; ;;AntThe article mentions Phil Dick for coining the term "andy". He also used the word "ant" in the short story "The Electric Ant", in which the protagonist is initially unaware that he is an electromechanical construct instead of a human being. Maybe not worth putting in the article, as I've never seen it catch on, but I just thought I'd mention it here. --BjKa (talk) 09:30, 13 March 2015 (UTC)
