He further subdued the Carians, and took several Ionian cities, including İzmir|Smyrna and Colophon. Smyrna was sacked and destroyed with its inhabitants forced to move into the countryside.1911He standardised the weight of coins (1 Stater = 168 grains of wheat). The coins were produced using an anvil die technique and stamped with the Lion's head, the symbol of the Mermnadae.He was succeeded by his son Croesus.1911 His daughter Aryenis of Lydia was Queen consort of Astyages, King of Media.His tomb still exists on the plateau between Lake Gygaea and the river Hermus to the north of Sardis;mdash;a large mound of earth with a substructure of huge stones.  It was excavated by Spiegelthal in 1854, who found that it covered a large vault of finely cut marble blocks approached by a flat-roofed passage of the same stone from the south. The sarcophagus and its contents had been removed by early plunderers of the tomb. All that was left were some broken alabaster vases, pottery and charcoal. On the summit of the mound were large phalli of stone. 1911Appearance in "The Histories"In ''The Histories'', Herodotus recounts how Alyattes continued his father's war against Miletus. According to Herodotus, Alyattes invaded Miletus annually to burn their crops over the course of several years. The troops left the horses and houses untouched so that the Milesians could plant a new crop, which the Lydians would then burn the following year. This continued until the end of the war eleven years later.References;Attribution** '':fr:Référence:Nos ancêtres de l'Antiquité (Christian Settipani)|Nos ancêtres de l'Antiquité'', 1991, Christian Settipani, p.152External links*[Livius],  by Jona Lendering
