It was originally developed by Texas Instruments as a replacement for the AGM-45 Shrike and AGM-78 Standard ARM system. Production was later taken over by Raytheon Corporation when it purchased the defense production business of Texas Instruments.DescriptionThe AGM-88 can detect, attack and destroy a radar antenna or transmitter with minimal aircrew input. The proportional guidance system that homes in on enemy radar emissions has a fixed antenna and seeker head in the missile's nose. A smokeless, solid-propellant, booster-sustainer rocket motor propels the missile at speeds over Mach 2. HARM, a U.S. Navy-led program, was initially integrated onto the A-6E, A-7 and F/A-18 and later onto the EA-6B. RDT;E for use on the F-14 was begun, but not completed. The USAF introduced HARM on the F-4G Wild Weasel and later on specialized F-16s equipped with the HARM Targeting System (HTS).HistoryDeploymentThe HARM missile was approved for full production in March 1983, obtained initial operating capability (IOC) on the A-7E Corsair II in late 1983 and then deployed in late 1985 with VA-72 and VA-46 aboard the aircraft carrier USS ''America''. In 1986 the first successful firing of the HARM from an EA-6B was performed by VAQ-131.  It was soon used in combat—in March 1986 against a Libyan Army (1951–2011)|Libyan S-200 Angara/Vega/Dubna|SA-5 site in the Gulf of Sidra, and then Operation Eldorado Canyon in April. HARM was used extensively by the United States Navy and the United States Air Force for Operation Desert Storm during the Gulf War of 1991.During the Gulf War, the HARM was involved in a friendly fire incident when the pilot of an F-4G Wild Weasel escorting a B-52 bomber mistook the latter's tail gun radar for an Iraqi AAA site. (This was after the tail gunner of the B-52 had targeted the F-4G, mistaking it for an Iraqi MiG.)  The F-4 pilot launched the missile and then saw that the target was the B-52, which was hit.  It survived with shrapnel damage to the tail and no casualties. The B-52 was subsequently renamed ''In HARM's Way''."Magnum" is spoken over the radio to announce the launch of an AGM-88. During the Gulf War, if an aircraft was illuminated by enemy radar a bogus "Magnum" call on the radio was often enough to convince the operators to power down.This technique would also be employed in Serbia during air operations in 1999.In 2013 President Obama offered the AGM-88 to Israel for the first time.AGM-88E AARGMAGM-88EThe newest upgrade, the ''AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM),'' features the latest software, enhanced capabilities intended to counter radar shutdown and passive radar using an additional active millimeter wave seeker.  It was released in November 2010 and is a joint venture by the US Department of Defense and the Italian Ministry of Defense and is produced by Alliant Techsystems.In November 2005, the Italian Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense signed a Memorandum of Agreement on the joint development of the AGM-88E AARGM missile. Italy was providing $20 million of developmental funding as well as several millions worth of material, equipment and related services. The Italian Air Force was expected to procure up to 250 missiles for its Tornado ECR aircraft. Thus flight test program was set to integrate the AARGM onto Tornado ECR's weapon system.The Navy demonstrated the AARGM's capability during Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT;E) in spring 2012 with live firing of 12 missiles.  Aircrew and maintenance training with live missiles was completed in June.Lot 1"ATK Defense Electronics Systems in Woodland Hills, CA receives a $70.6 million firm-fixed-price contract for AARGM Full Rate Production Lot 1. ATK will convert 53 AGM-88B HARM missiles provided by the US government, turning them into 49 AGM-88E AARGM All-Up Rounds for the US Navy, and 4 missiles for Italy. ATK will also provide 23 AGM-88E Captive Air Training Missile systems for the US Navy, which have seekers but no rocket motors, along with all related supplies and services.Work will be performed in Woodland Hills, CA (90%); various locations in Italy (8.1%); Ridgecrest, CA (1.7%), and Clearwater, FL (0.2%), and is expected to be complete in December 2012. This contract was not competitively procured pursuant to FAR 6.302-1. This contract combines purchases for the Navy ($65.0M / 92.06%) and the Government of Italy ($5.6M / 7.94%). US Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD manages the contract (N00019-12-C-0113)"Lot 2The Navy authorized Full-Rate Production (FRP) of the AARGM in August 2012, with 72 missiles for the Navy and nine for the Italian Air Force to be delivered in 2013.  A U.S. Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornet squadron will be the first forward-deployed unit with the AGM-88E.[Navy Approves Full Rate Production for New Anti-Radiation Missile] - Strategicdefenseintelligence.com, August 30, 2012Lot 4In September 2013, ATK delivered the 100th AARGM to the U.S. Navy.  The AGM-88E program is on schedule and on budget, with Full Operational Capability (FOC) planned for September 2014. - PRNewswire.com, 17 September 2013On September 3, 2015 U.S. Department of Defence noticed order to Alliant Techsystems Operations LLC, Defense Electronic Systems, California, for a $118,724,146 firm-fixed-price contract, to Full Rate Production Lot 4 procurement of the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM) services for the U.S. Navy and the Governments of Australia and Italy, to include conversion of AGM-88B High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missiles to 142 AGM-88E All-Up-Rounds and 12 Captive Air Training Missiles, to include related supplies.It will be initially integrated onto the F/A-18C/D, F/A-18E/F, EA-18G, and Tornado ECR aircraft and later on the F-35.The Navy's FY 2016 budget included funding for an extended range AARGM-ER that utilizes the existing guidance system and warhead of the AGM-88E with a solid integrated rocket-ramjet for double the range.  Development funding will last to 2020. - Aviationweek.com, 3 February 2015In September 2015, the AGM-88E successfully hit a mobile ship target in a live-fire test, demonstrating the missile's ability to use anti-radiation homing and millimeter wave radar to detect, identify, locate, and engage moving targets. - Upi.com, 23 September 2015OperatorsMap with AGM-88 operators in blueFile:AIM-9 AIM-120 and AGM-88 on F-16C.jpg|thumb|F-16 carrying an AIM-120 AMRAAM (top), AIM-9 Sidewinder (middle) and AGM-88 HARMCurrent operators* Australia: AGM-88E variant ordered; to be used on EA-18G Growlers.* Egypt* Germany* Greece* Israel* Italy: AGM-88E variant.* Kuwait* Saudi Arabia* SpainHighBeam* Taiwan* Morocco* Turkey* United Arab Emirates* United States:** United States Navy** United States Air Force**United States Marine CorpsSee also* Anti-radiation missile* DRDO Anti-Radiation Missile* AGM-154 JSOW* ALARM* MAR-1* Chinese LD-10* List of missilesReferences; Notes2; Bibliography*External linksAGM-88 HARMAGM-088AGM-088
