And we want to avoid having every single miniscule detail in there b/c the synopsis becomes too bloated ; crufty.

While this article describes Willard consistently as a Special Forces officer, there is no explicit indication at any point, even in the augmented version of the film, that he is, in fact, a Green Beret.  The only point where the script flirts with the idea (as FlieGerFaUstMe262 ) is when Willard, reading through Kurtz's dossier, marvels at Kurtz's passing jump school and doing Special Forces training at "38 fucking years old."  Both programs are notoriously grueling and difficult even for young men in their physical prime, and when Willard mentions that he "did it when [he] was 19 and it damn near wasted [him]," it's somewhat ambiguous whether he's taking about jump school or Special Forces training.  If it ''is'' the latter, Willard does not indicate whether or not he was one of the extremely small percentage of candidates who actually make it all the way through the selection and qualification process.  Indeed, he is never seen wearing a green beret or any Special Forces insignia.Just after his bedroom freak-out at the beginning of the film, Willard's unit is stated by the visiting sergeant to be the fictional 505th battalion of the real 173rd Airborne, but attached to SOG.  This seems to be accurately reflected in the uniforms he wears from that point on in the movie: the insignia on his right shoulder, indicating his former combat unit, is of the 173rd Airborne Brigade, and the SSI on his left shoulder indicates that his current assignment has him working directly for MACV.  There is also a Ranger Tab there, showing him to be a graduate of Ranger School.  If he was with the Rangers before apparently becoming some sort of black-bag-man-without-portfolio for the CIA and the top echelon of MACV, the affiliation with the 173rd Airborne would make sense, as Company N, 75th Ranger Regiment, was attached to it in Vietnam.  If he had been with the Special Forces, the insignia he wears doesn't make any sense at all.  There may be an element of OR in this, but certainly not more than there is in making him out to be a Green Beret.  At least in calling him a Ranger you can point to concrete elements in the costuming as evidence.  What's everyone else's take on this?  User:Dynaflow|--'''''Dynaflow''''';/font; User_talk:Dynaflow|babble;/font;;05:13, 3 May 2009 (UTC):As an intirim solution, I have changed the lead so that it introduces Willard as an officer with MACV-SOG, rather than as a Ranger or Special Forces officer per se.  This affiliation ''is'' explicitly stated in the film, and so using it is probably the best way to avoid the appearance of possible original research in the lead.  User:Dynaflow|--'''''Dynaflow''''';/font; User_talk:Dynaflow|babble;/font;;06:49, 3 May 2009 (UTC):::Well there was no Special Forces tab during that time, and for him to be wearing the Green Beret in the combat zone would be a little tacky. I'll have to admit I have not seen the beginning of this move in a long time, and cannot remember the scenes you are talking about. So I must take your word for it. If what you say is true, I would say that you accurately represent his status.  --; User:FlieGerFaUstMe262|Nicht Nein! (talk) 09:55, 3 May 2009 (UTC):::: Ok I think the author above has it. I'm a former soldier of the 173rd and a military history buff. He is wearing a 173rd unit combat patch on the right shoulder, indicating that he was in combat with the 173rd and having a ranger tab on the left shoulder with his current unit assignment MACV-SOG, he would have been most likely a Ranger in N company (but may have not been either), the movie never clearly mentions the Captain's military career, its only eluded to by what he mentions. He could have simply been a Ranger qualified paratrooper in the 173rd, then was assigned to MACV-SOG at a later date from the time he earned his combat patch with the 173rd. If he was indeed a ranger in combat during this period, he should by all account be wearing a ranger combat patch in lieu of the 173rd patch, but may have been given the choice of what to wear (as with some soldiers who go to combat with x number of units X number of times.) In his position, its strange he is wearing any insignia at all, as with most SOF missions, especially one of this nature, he most likely would have not been wearing anything at all, or just maybe a 173rd patch to identify him as a "normal" infantryman instead of a SOF soldier in case of capture by VC or other enemy forces. On another note, it is very unlikely he  was a green beret or went to SOF school or training "At 19", this at the time was almost impossible, you had to be identified and selected to be a green beret and I know of not one soldier that went through SF training before the age of 21 during that period. it is more likely that he volunteered for an Airborne assignment at 19, in which he went directly to school after basic training, I'm still trying to figure out how or when Willard was commissioned as an officer. This is an ongoing argument with my father a 4 year Vietnam Vet with SF.  If I'm wrong please let me know.

They never make his commissioning source clear, although if we could actually see some of the briefing papers that might make it clearer. Also, given the timeframe of the movie Willard could have been with the LRRP unit of the 173rd, although the comments about him working for COMSEC Intelligence could hint at an assignment to one of the Field Force LRRP companies. With reference to the SOG assignment, they did wear fatigues with patches when in the rear (on occasion, at least...the "profile" fatigues). When in the field they tended to wear unmarked OD jungle fatigues (although some did break up the outline with black spray paint or even wear NVA uniforms). The tiger stripes Willard wears would most likely have been one of the "profile" uniforms.Intothatdarkness (talk) 19:40, 27 May 2011 (UTC):::::::The unit currently listed for Willard in the article is wrong, too.

There was, of course, no 5th Battalion active in Vietnam (the 173rd Airborne Brigade had the 1st through 4th battalions.;/s; The direct quote mentions that he's "assigned SOG," meaning that he would have been detached from his parent battalion and seconded to MACV-SOG.

He could have simply REMEMBERED, not necessarily HALLUCINATED the visions of destruction in Vietnam. We might think he wrecks the room because he is allucinating and thinks he still is in Vietnam, but it might as well be that he acts like that because of his anger and frustration, and that doesn't necessarily leads to hallucination.

Joe Estevez is listed as "stand-in/voice-over: Willard (uncredited)" on [imdb I believe the credits for imdb are based on official sources, correct? --Harizotoh9 (talk) 03:03, 3 November 2012 (UTC):::No, IMDb is user edited, in the main, and for that reason it's not usually considered a Wikipedia WP:RS. ''Some'' entries are "verified" by staff and are so tagged. This was not so tagged. --Lexein (talk) 17:29, 7 April 2013 (UTC)Rotten TomatoesCan you remember when the movie originally came out how the Rotten Tomatoes website rated it?...Are you all so young that no one remembers the original receptions? Are they gone?... or don't people care anymore, so everything has to be "fresh" and instantly relatable?Do we really need that as the absolutely first thing under "Critical response"?UFFSpecial:Contributions/89.150.187.161|89.150.187.161 (talk) 10:13, 9 December 2012 (UTC):I concur, and go further: RottenTomatoes and Metacritic scores should not be used. If used, they should go ''last'', and be used minimally, as I expand in User:Lexein/Review aggregators reconsidered.#Aggregators are ''derivative'', and like other tertiary sources and compendia, are generally not used as sources.#They aren't frontline reviewers, so they have no place at the beginning of reception sections#They aren't considered reliable by others: they are never quoted in other reliable sources.#Their aggregation algorithms are unverifiable, subjective, and inconsistent#The websites are heavy with ad spam, so being listed on Wikipedia is just more promo for them#There are several POV editors who keep pushing RT to the beginning of ==Reception== sections:--Lexein (talk) 14:12, 9 December 2012 (UTC)::This should be discussed at WikiProject Film, and a consensus reached there.  This has been discussed in the past, but no firm consensus was ever reached.  I am highly dubious about the use of RT, especially in regard to older films. ---'''User:TheOldJacobite|The Old Jacobite;/font;'''''User talk:TheOldJacobite|The '45'';/font; 15:40, 9 December 2012 (UTC):::True about discussing at WikiProject Film. Here, though, I've removed it from the lead, moved it to the end of the reception section, and minimized its use. --Lexein (talk) 16:02, 9 December 2012 (UTC)::::Personally I don't think these aggregators have any place on articles about older films. They don't provide a comprehensive survey of contemporary reception, and have limited value in assessing the legacy of older films. Betty Logan (talk) 17:23, 9 December 2012 (UTC):::::''(I assume you mean ''the film's contemporary reception'' above)'':::::To me, grouping reviews by release dates helps: original theatrical period, video/DVD/streaming releases, re-releases/director's-cuts, etc. As written elsewhere (thanks), RT is most applicable to recent (;2000) releases, so that's how I (already, without thinking about it) treat them.  I would prefer to only use RT when all the reviews aggregated are unambiguous in their approval/disapproval. Of concern to me is RT's ''interpretation'' of ambiguous/low-passion/conflicted "it was good/enjoyable/fun but I didn't like it" reviews. --Lexein (talk) 20:34, 9 December 2012 (UTC)Consensus at WT:FILM#Film review aggregators - RS? is for WP using Rotten Tomatoes, as has been long established. One can debate its use in older films, but it should still be mentioned.  The high score it got here is notable, and should not be buried. And in particular, its Ext link should not be removed. - Gothicfilm (talk) 00:03, 10 December 2012 (UTC):Sorry, consensus here is that it does not merit multiple mentions in the article, does not merit placement in the article lead section. Its placement at the top of the reception section is still disputed, and given time, consensus will form for placement at the end, not the beginning. Your pre-emptive edit has been reverted, since you didn't really discuss it, and attempted to enforce some unrelated discussion onto this article. --Lexein (talk) 00:38, 10 December 2012 (UTC):Addendum: What you call "buried", I call ''cited'', '''or''' ''listed in EL'' (not both). To elevate RT higher than that is pro-RT POV, and PROMO, and possibly COI (for any editors with an undeclared conflict of interest involving RT). Hi, RT employees! Tag! --Lexein (talk) 06:07, 10 December 2012 (UTC)::Your 3rd statement above ''They aren't considered reliable by others: they are never quoted in other reliable sources'' is quite false. And ''some unrelated discussion''?  It's on the WP:FILM Talk page. And is your repeated removal of RT's Ext link just sloppy or deliberate? You haven't even mentioned it here, much less justified it. - Gothicfilm (talk) 00:51, 10 December 2012 (UTC)::::Sorry, "quite false" is false. RT is so unreliable it should ''only'' be cited ''specifically when it is cited by RS.'' So that will be rare, and will satisy my concerns. Aside from that, no, at WP:FILM, I realize one point at a time is best, and I argue RT is not RS, because it's patently derivative (on this I sadly disagree with Betty). Here, I argue four things: never using RT more than once, not in the lead, not first in the reception section, and not for this particular pre-2000 film. Consensus is forming against RT for this film, and hopefully all pre-2000 films, because I strongly value actual source reliability, as should you. --Lexein (talk) 06:07, 10 December 2012 (UTC):::I agree with Betty about not needing Rotten Tomatoes here. This is the kind of film where we should have plenty of coverage about its critical reception—contemporary and retrospective—in print. I'm not entirely opposed to mentioning RT in passing, just that it does not have to be used to lead coverage of the film's reception as with current films. Erik (talk ;#124; Special:Contributions/Erik|contribs) 03:39, 10 December 2012 (UTC)::::I think in this case the RT scores are pretty much worthless, they are not really indicative of the film's reception. However, they do provide a review index so I have no objection to it as an EL. Betty Logan (talk) 09:50, 10 December 2012 (UTC)themewas this movie, by any chance, an anti military?  — Preceding unsigned comment added by D-dub4 (talk • Special:Contributions/D-dub4|contribs) 22:33, 22 March 2013 (UTC);;; ;;Airstrike in final sceneThe plot section currently says there was an airstrike in the final scene. However, there is also a note that basically contradicts this. I think the consensus among viewers is that there was no airstrike and the plot section should be edited to reflect this. There is definitely no airstrike in Redux, and if that article is merged in, another clarification should be made. Jrmrjnck (talk) 09:48, 7 April 2013 (UTC)I'm editing out both the claim that the ending credits scene shows the airstrike occurring and the footnote. There's no indication, from Coppola himself or from the actual course of the movie, that Willard calls in the airstrike. Willard turns off the radio connected to the ballistics base, pretty good indication that he doesn't mean to "drop the bomb" as Kurtz wanted. Plus this source  corroborates an uncited bit from the [endings section of the article]:I don't have the DVD to double check this at present, but until someone actually has Coppola's commentary to cite, the best information says Coppola didn't intend the closing credits to be a continuation of the plot, and there's no reason to refute that in the summary section. Also, the footnote is obsolete in light of the same information being relayed in the Endings section of the article. Presumably readers who are confused about the matter can simply head there.MVanHoose (talk) 04:49, 6 May 2013 (UTC)music editing*The above is interesting and probably should be used in the article.
