Please forgive me.  I really can't even begin to understand your argument.  Please explain why you have removed discussion of a matter which would appear to clear up several mysteries, on several pages, in a way which seems pretty much self apparent once it is pointed out.  Why did you remove comments?  And why did you remove what appears to amount to a citation from Wikipedea itself stating that new insights appear in encyclopedeas, including Wikipedea.  It seems to be saying that is a positive.  I saved that quote and I‚Äôve put it below.Online collaboratives are run by users, some are experts, some are not‚Ä¶ ''Expect surprising insights. A major encyclopedia, like Britannica, can have articles written by highly intelligent experts who might describe astounding insights in their articles. However, even the street-level Wikipedia sometimes contains articles by intelligent experts or eyewitnesses, who avoided the committee censorship, and wrote profound insights within a Wikipedia article. Also, profound information might still exist in prior Wikipedia revisions: check the Talk discussion of an article to see if expert opinions were removed but still exist in prior revisions that can be viewed''.Can I make a practical suggestion.  As you feel so strongly about ensuring that no discussion can take place upon the subject of additions to the page about Adamic, could you please explain your feelings?  Maybe we can overcome your personal issues on the matter and we can then move on to further rational discussion of things which otherwise seem to make little rational sense.‚ÄîPreceding unsigned comment added by It's Snowball (talk ‚Ä¢ Special:Contributions/It's Snowball|contribs) ;;;:I'll make a suggestion as well: don't misstate the facts.

Also to hearing whether people will be allowed to consider whether additions or changes should be made to the article about Adamic on people's Talk Pages, or if the ban upon consideration of information, no matter how self evident, also extends to disallowing people from letting people know that discussion of the article about Adamic is taking place there instead.Can I also ask if the ban is so total that it extends to other Wikipedea projects.‚ÄîPreceding unsigned comment added by It's Snowball (talk ‚Ä¢ Special:Contributions/It's Snowball|contribs) ;;;:Again, you need to actually read WP:NOR.

For some time now, I have been pointing out that I have not attempted to re-write the article.  I am hoping that it will not be necessary to point this out again after this.  We are only talking about being able to consider the relevance of the information to the page about Adamic on the talk page provided for that purpose.  People cannot consider the relevance for themselves if the observations are removed and banned, along with anyone who dares refer to them anywhere on Wikipedea.  Once again, could I ask that the quote from Wikipedea be addressed.  Namely, that of allowing insight in Wikipedea.  If the rules say it is wrong, then Wikipedea does not have a clear view upon it.  The quote about finding insights on Wikipedea is on a front page on Wikipedea.  ‚ÄîPreceding unsigned comment added by It's Snowball (talk ‚Ä¢ Special:Contributions/It's Snowball|contribs) 19:20, 1 July 2008 (UTC);;; ;;:It's been considered; it's not cited to a reliable source, and so has no place in the encyclopedia.

The talk pages are here to discuss points so to judge their relevance.  Not for anyone to insist that if anyone dare attempt to discuss the relevance of any point raised, they will all be banned from Wikipedea.  Moreover, you have failed entirely to address the matter of Wikipedea's statement that insights are a positive to be expected on Wikipedea.  ‚ÄîPreceding unsigned comment added by It's Snowball (talk ‚Ä¢ Special:Contributions/It's Snowball|contribs) 19:12, 3 July 2008 (UTC);;; ;;:Your opinion has been noted. If you repost this material here, I will block you. - Nunh-huh 01:14, 4 July 2008 (UTC)Thank you for making your position clear.  Without wishing to sound disrespectful, the information about Adamic and it's written form Enochian, is being rewritten and will, quite properly, be posted here so that we can all comment on its relevance to the article.  I take it from that that if anyone attempts to provide insights about reading the written form without the use of any dictionaries either here or anywhere else, such as the discussion page about Enochian, the information, those responsible for putting it there and any anyone attempting to discuss the relevance will also be banned.For the sake of clarity, the written form is so self evident that as soon as the deliberate distractions, such as making gold and other glossaries - which really don't make any sense - are removed, Enochian can be read instantly.  Like the verbal form of Adamic, it can say a multitude of things at the same time in different languages so that it is possible to begin reading Enochian with the alphabet alone.This has been given to well over a thousand people now, and with just one exception, everyone was able to perceive it.  Consequently, it will not be possible to say that it is just my idea.  I take it that you will not allow people to see this for themselves either.  Even though the original government code cracker, 007, John Dee, said that it contains a hidden message for mankind from God.  (I'm not religious.  I'm just open minded.)  ‚ÄîPreceding unsigned comment added by It's Snowball (talk ‚Ä¢ Special:Contributions/It's Snowball|contribs) 17:19, 6 July 2008 (UTC);;; ;;: There are a number of issues is ascribing Enochian as the written form of Adamic. The simplest issue to deal with is that the writing direction is opposite that of the earliest known writing systems. Other issues include relationship, or rather lack thereof, between the glyphs used in Enochian, and those of ancient writing system; the fact that it is an alphabet, and not abugida, or abjad, which most early writing systems were --- the exceptions were ideographic. John Dee's reference about a hidden message was to the content of the material he received. Specifically, he thought that the material could be decrypted using two different methods, to provide two different messages.jonathon (talk) 21:43, 8 July 2008 (UTC)Thank you for the comments Jonathon.  I‚Äôve clearly tried to see whether the information that has become available is credible, and as such, whether it is relevant to the page about Adamic.  That‚Äôs the kind of consideration that the matter needs and it‚Äôs really useful.  Genuinely, thank you.  Although my primary aim here is to see whether it is relevant to the article, and if so, what would be an appropriate addition either to the article or the discussion page, this kind of comment on the talk page is also useful in seeing if it is possible to shoot the new information down completely.Some of what you have said now is very relevant and I‚Äôm strongly inclined to agree with some.  The idea of an alphabet seemed at odds with what I have seen, for more than one reason.  Firstly, the notion that this is the first form of communication seems to suggest that it is way too early for something like an alphabet.  Also, I can‚Äôt see more than one of the characters in the Enochian tablets in what we are told by some sources is the alphabet.  It appears that people can naturally read things in it in a number of languages, so an individual alphabet seems wrong.  The notion of a alphabet seems also seems at odds with the new information, because since there appear to be no individual words in this form off communication, the idea of individual letters wouldn‚Äôt seem right.  Rather, we are looking at similarities with all sorts of different kinds of symbols and sounds.It would have been fantastic if we could dismiss it on the grounds that the direction is opposite to that of the earliest known writing systems.  Unfortunately, characters can also be perceived as individual symbols, so that, for example, one person immediately identified one of the characters as a symbol for God in his culture.  It was also perceived to be a womb and a heart.  It seems that numbers can also be perceived, so that when the numerical number 7 is read in conjunction with the characters around it, it formed part of a word in a specific message.  (An apparent greeting for the reader of the alphabet from Heaven.)  Since people are able to perceive similarities with characters from different alphabets, as well as symbols, and because people are able to perceive words and phrases in different languages, I had to point out to people that they will be able to read it in the way that they are used to reading, whether that be from right to left, or top to bottom in one of the tablets, which I have yet to try.Also on that point, it‚Äôs been pointed out that there are ancient tablets with an unknown origin in Chinese or Japanese, and that no matter where you begin reading, which changes you make in direction, and no matter how long you carry on reading, they continue to read coherently, poetically, and to educate the reader about spiritual matters.  I know the Qu‚Äôran is poetic and I‚Äôm under the impression the Torah is too, if they are read in the original language that they were delivered in.  So if it is true about these oriental tablets, and I hope to find out, it seems reasonable to suspect they came from the same source.  Since Enochian is sometimes written in boxes and is also very poetic, it seems that it would be a mistake to assume that anything that is written in it should be read in a particular way.You said that John Dee thought that the material could be decrypted using two different methods, to provide two different messages.  As it can say different things in the same language at the same time, and also say other things in other language at just the same time, what I have seen of it is not at odds with Dee‚Äôs theory, but goes considerably beyond even that.  The interpretations, which appear to have been given to Kelley in a book at Glastonbury, and which seem to make no sense to most people, seem to have been a deliberate attempt to distract people from something that is far more obvious, once these distractions and any preconceived notions have been removed.  It can be interpreted in many ways, and can be read in many ways.  (My immediate impression was that as this is supposed to be the first language and way of writing in it, it would not bear much resemblance to any rules that we have in this day and age.)My sincere thanks for the comments, and I look forward to your next observations.  You clearly know a great deal about languages.  As I understand it, you are also fluent in Hebrew and know a lot about religious tracts.  I‚Äôd be interested to see how you and the others feel about removing the other comments and editing this down to the relevant points being considered, forgoing the information I originally posted on this discussion page for the time being and including a basic description of the notion being discussed.  Would you also consider looking at some of the ways that the Enochian ‚Äúalphabet‚Äù has already been interpreted?  That would give you a better idea of the source of the information, and would also allow me to glean good comments for consideration.  ‚ÄîPreceding unsigned comment added by It's Snowball (talk ‚Ä¢ Special:Contributions/It's Snowball|contribs) 15:58, 14 July 2008 (UTC);;; ;;Dante/EveThere was one point not adressed in the article and i'm not sure if it was adressed by dantehimself. it says how Dante argued that Eve spoke first. it is interesting but not entirely accurate which is why the article should be reveiwed and certain changes made. we read in Gen. 2:19-23 that Adam not only named all the animals before Eve was even created, it also says how Adam named her "woman" because she came from "man".----  ‚ÄîPreceding unsigned comment added by HAMDMAN (talk ‚Ä¢ Special:Contributions/HAMDMAN|contribs) 18:52, 15 September 2008 (UTC);; ;;:That was my first thought, but irrelevant to the article--the focus of the comment is that Dante said something about Adamic, not whether Dante's arguments were sound.  But yes, according to the Bible, Dante as presented here was wrong.  I think the problem may be in the translation of "mulierum invenitur ante omnes fuisse locutam," since I'm assuming that's saying "the woman is said to have come before all" (out of context)--but not saying anything about her necessarily ''speaking'' first.  Maybe Dante's/Eco's Latin is the problem. Googling the phrase brings nothing up but mirrors of this article, so I'm betting it isn't even Dante.
