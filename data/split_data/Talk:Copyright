;;I think I will add this quote to the articlewhat do you all think?Thewhitebox (talk) 11:16, 9September 2014 (UTC):  Hmm.  First, the source is not clear.  Second, it is clearly opinionated - so is the author or issuing party an authority?  Third, it provides a lot of country-specific information that is otherwise unfortunately lacking.Kdammers (talk) 20:37, 1 July 2015 (UTC)Corporate personsI came here looking for information on the length of copyright for a book that was written by someone using a corporate pseudonym, as is common in a lot of pulp fiction.  If, say, Grosset ; Dunlap keeps giving out Hardy Boys stories to authors to write under the byline of Franklin W. Dixon, when does the copyright on the early ones (e.g., "The Tower Treasure," originally copyrighted 1927, by a perhaps now-unknown and surely long dead author) expire if ever?  I got no help from the article. Kdammers (talk) 20:45, 1 July 2015 (UTC):This is an article on copyright in general, it tries not to go into too much detail of any particular countries' copyright laws.  There's a box "Copyright law by country" at the bottom where you can investigate the status in the country you're interested in.  For example, for the US, check out Copyright law of the United States.
