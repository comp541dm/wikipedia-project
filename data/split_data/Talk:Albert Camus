He witnessed the execution of Gabriel Péri?The idea that Camus ''witnessed'' the death of Péri (in Fort Mont-Valérien?) requires a citation. Mark Orme, in ''The Development of Albert Camus's Concern for Social and Political Justice'' writes that, "one should treat with caution Camus's own recollection that he joined forces with the Resistance movement upon reading, in Lyons, of the death of the influential communist leader Gabriel Peri...". (p. 238) This seems an altogether more likely scenario to me. Péri is not mentioned in the French article about Camus.
