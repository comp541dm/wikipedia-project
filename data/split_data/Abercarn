In 1892 a local board of health and local government district of Abercarn was formed. This became Abercarn urban district in 1894, governed by an urban district council of twelve members. Under the Local Government Act 1972 the urban district was abolished in 1974, becoming part of the borough of Islwyn, Gwent. Further local government organisation in 1996 placed the area in the county borough of Caerphilly. The former urban district corresponds to the three communities of Abercarn, Crumlin and Newbridge.SportAbercarn is home to Abercarn Rugby Club which is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union.*[Abercarn RFC] -Abercarn RFC.See alsoAbercarn*[Welsh Coal Mines] - details of all the local pits.* -gallery of recent images.NotesReferences;Attribution*
