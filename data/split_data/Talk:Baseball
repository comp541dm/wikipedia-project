;;No prominent picture of a ball field?I just had a quick suggestion to make - it seems odd that to find just a picture of a (real) baseball field, you have to scroll down pretty far, and then it's only a very small picture. IMO, to someone who knows nothing of baseball, the 2D diagrams wouldn't give a good idea of what a ball field looks like in real life. Shouldn't something like this be a bit more prominent?

There is a picture of a baseball game at the top now, and the diagram of positions has been relocated lower.→User:Michael J|MichaelJUser talk:Michael J|ⓉSpecial:Contributions/Michael J|ⒸSpecial:Emailuser/Michael_J|Ⓜ;/font; 06:23, 10 May 2015 (UTC)EquipmentIt says you need a bat, ball, glove, bases(field). But what about a helment? I suggest that you add a helment to the equipment.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Jroles7 (talk • Special:Contributions/Jroles7|contribs) 20:28, 12 May 2015 (UTC);;; ;;:A helmet is required by rule at certain levels of the game, but it is not absolutely necessary to play baseball.  It isn't wise to play without a helmet, but it is possible.→User:Michael J|MichaelJUser talk:Michael J|ⓉSpecial:Contributions/Michael J|ⒸSpecial:Emailuser/Michael_J|Ⓜ;/font; 13:35, 14 May 2015 (UTC)Semi-protected edit request on 23 October 2015;;In the 2nd paragraph of this wiki, please change:The OFFENSE attempts to score runs by hitting a ball ...TO:The BATTING TEAM attempts to score runs by hitting a ball ...(The first paragraph stated there are two player states: batting and fielding. The 2nd paragraph introduces a new term, offense, without any indication that this is another descriptor for the batting state.Maybe this variation would be better:The batting team (offense) attempts to score runs by hitting a ball ...However, doing so opens up another can of worms. Maybe the first sentence should be recast from this:Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each who take turns batting and fielding.To this:Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each who take turns batting (OFFENSE) and fielding (DEFENSE).The 3rd paragraph uses the terms "batting team" and "fielding team". These terms should be used consistently throughout, and other words/terms should not be included willy-nilly. Or, based on my proposed change to the 1st paragraph, the terms BATTING TEAM and FIELDING TEAM can be consistently replaced with OFFENSE and DEFENSE, respectively (starting from the 2nd paragraph.)I have not read this wiki in entirety, and I guess the terms BATTING TEAM and FIELDING TEAM are used throughout. I think as long as my initial change request is implemented, it will help enough that the entire wiki can remain as is since the confusion about offense/defense will be adequately relieved in the 2nd paragraph.;;Scottmeltzer (talk) 00:17, 24 October 2015 (UTC):File:Yes check.svg|20px|link= '''Done''';;, see Special:Diff/687630411|here. ;mdash;Skyllfully (talk ;#124; Special:Contribs/Skyllfully|contribs) 19:46, 26 October 2015 (UTC)Semi-protected edit request on 6 November 2015;;I would like to change to picture that shows angel stadium to dodger stadium;;Special:Contributions/198.72.247.206|198.72.247.206 (talk) 23:45, 6 November 2015 (UTC):Rationale?
