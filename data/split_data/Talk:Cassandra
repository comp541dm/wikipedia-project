If we listed every time such a famous character was referenced or alluded to, we'd have several hundred thousand words of such descriptions.

Although it previously mentioned that she predicted Ag's death, it was simply a cursory mention devoid of detail.  It never previously mentioned anything about a purple carpet being involved.  This therfore comes off as a nonsequitur.  I am pointing this out for correction rather than correcting it myself because I don't know if she warned him not to walk on a purple carpet, to avoid purple, to not do what his wife asked, to avoid carpets in Mycenae, or any number of other possibilities.  Someone please fix this. -68.196.0.191 13:52, 23 September 2005 (UTC):Weren't all of Cassandra's warnings ones of doom and destruction?

Furthermore, this "symmetry" can not exist between such distinct, independent traditions as ancient greek and judean mythology, as they are not comparable traditions. It is also a POV, which adds nothing informative to the subject.— Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/213.240.3.226|213.240.3.226 (talk) 06:16, 5 February 2006;;:Israel and Greece are both in the Eastern Mediterranean, which is far from being an impenetrable ocean. The Greek alphabet is derived from the Phoenician alphabet. There is no reason why the traditions could not have cross-fertilized. But even if Greece and Israel were thousands of miles apart or on different planets, it is most interesting that Jonah and Cassandra are in such structurally symmetric positions. Both of them, moreover, ended up very unhappy - Jonah as distressed by the non-fulfillment of his prophecy of doom as Cassandra was by the fulfillment of hers. You make a very good point, Anonymous, by bringing up the matter of gender. Perhaps if Cassandra had been a man she would have been believed. Perhaps if Jonah had been a woman he would not have been believed. Then Troy would have survived, but Niniveh would not. Das Baz 15:47, 23 June 2006 (UTC):Oh yes, and it is an egregious absurdity to say that any contrast of public reactions to male and female pronouncements, implicit or explicit, intentional or not, is "sexist." Suppose someone said that a Black Prophet (like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.) was disbelieved while a White Prophet was believed - would this be "racist"?Das Baz 15:52, 23 June 2006 (UTC)A Tale of Two CitiesTroy and Niniveh are both in the Near Eastern cultural area, and only a few hundred miles apart from each other. Many people travelled between the two cities, as they were both major centers of trade and commerce. Das Baz 16:29, 24 June 2006 (UTC)CurseI really think that the caveat of the gods that she would not believed should be mentioned in the opening. That's perhaps the single most important thing about the Cassandra myth. --DanielCD 02:58, 9 February 2006 (UTC)Reality of Cassandra"Much of Homer's story of Troy was real as proven by Heinrich Schliemann that discovered the city. We know that there was a Troy that was destroyed in war, right in the place that Homer said. There was also a King that likely had daughters. The earliest known version of the story did not say Cassandra had the power to tell the future. Beyond that, little is known for sure."This is a highly dubious claim to make. A city most likely Ilium was discovered along the coast of Turkey by Schliemann, yes. However, to say that "much of Homer's story" was ''proven'' by Schliemann is a very shoddy assertion (even while excluding his notoriously destructive and careless excavation techniques). ''How'' is the real Troy similar to Homer's descriptions? ''How'' do you know there was a king? Was there only one king the entire time?

There are serious grammatical problems which make them unintelligible.  They are also unreferenced, and appear to by original research.  They also appear to be fancruft in the sense that they are about Disney, not about Cassandra.  The material is not in itself notable.

SmashTheState (talk) 07:23, 18 June 2011 (UTC)Modern adaptations taggingI've tagged quite a number of the "Modern Adaptations" with citation needed templates. Unless reliable sources are presented which verify that these are based on the Cassandra myth, they must be removed. We cannot ourselves interpret which "retellings" are related to Cassandra and which are not; doing so would be original research. Qwyrxian (talk) 03:32, 22 February 2012 (UTC):I think the connection of new stories to old stories is of interest.  Tagging of original research is appropriate and desirable, but I don't think removal is the right action if the modern adaptation has very similar themes or character/place names that it must have been inspired by the original. Having said that, I think the statement "The motion picture Contact based upon Carl Sagan's novel borrows the myth with Jodie Foster playing the Cassandra figure and Matthew McConaughey as the Apollo figure" should be removed promptly, unless a reliable source is presented, because the well known movie Contact has zero similarity to the Cassandra myth.
