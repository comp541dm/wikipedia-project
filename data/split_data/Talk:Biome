Pfly 07:48, 10 April 2007 (UTC)TemplateCan we consider revising and reintroducing the biome template that I created some time ago? I think that it would be useful to have some sort of way of navigating through the various biomes. I know that I rather briskly introduced it beforehand, but I feel that with some improvement, it could really work (I know it’s rather massive!) Cheers! Max Naylor 19:39, 2 April 2007 (UTC)IntroductionI'm thinking of editing the introduction, but thought I'd post about it here first.One of the issues is the way the word biome is defined (even in many textbooks) as a large regional grouping based on specific plants and animals (or biota). But biomes are not, strictly speaking, based on biota, as just about any global biome map shows, like , a quick find via google. A biome like "temperate deciduous forest" occurs on most continents, as that map shows, but the biota of any given biome is quite different on different continents. Australian forests have Agathis (kauri) trees, for example, while South America has Fitzroya (alerce), and North America has Douglas-fir. Europe has none of these. Terms like biota and "plant community" are based on specific species and groups of species, if I understand it right.Wouldn't it be useful to point out something about how biomes are not based on specific plants or communities but rather on "ecologically similar" biota that are "not necessarily related taxonomically"? Some definitions do make this point -- like [here] and [here]. Others don't, like [here], which seems to confuse biomes and ecozones ("biogeographic kingdoms" on that page).A glossary in a WWF book I have defines ''biota'' as "the combined flora, fauna, and microorganisms of a given region"; and, in contrast, ''guild'' as "..group of organisms, not necessarily taxomonically related, .. [but] ecologically similar in .. diet, behavior, ... or with regard to their ecological role in general". They use the term "major habitat type" (MHT) instead of biome, saying that MHTs are "roughly equivalent to biomes." The glossary defines MHT as a set of ecoregions that are similar in several ways; 1) similar climate; 2) similar vegetation structure; 3) similar biodiversity patterns; and 4) flora and fauna with similar guild structures and life histories." The use of the term guild in place of biota seems significant.Anyway, I was thinking of trying to rewrite the introduction to make this kind of stuff clearer. As it is now, it is hard to tell why biomes are not more like ecozones -- which are based on biota, distinguishing Australia from North America.This brings up another issue with the introduction. If the stuff I wrote above is true, then biomes are not based on regional or geographic patterns. Once defined and mapped, biomes show geographic patterns, but isn't that a effect rather than a cause of defining biomes? And if so, then it is not quite accurate to say that biomes are "subdivided into ecoregions", as I've often seen. Rather, ecoregions are defined by various factors including geographic ones, resulting in a bounded region. Ecoregions are assigned to a biome (or MHT). As a result, you can make a map of biomes, but the geographic boundaries come from the ecoregion definitions and not the biome -- at least in the WWF system, which seems to be the main one used on wikipedia. There are probably other systems that do define biomes geographically and then subdivide them.My thought is to try to condense this long babble I just wrote into something short and simple to use in the introduction. Perhaps something about the meaning of "biome" in a very general sense, then a mention of example systems, including the WWF's system, which can then be explained in more detail in its own section. Many other pages could use clarification along these lines, it seems to me.Does this all make sense? Sorry for the lengthy text. Pfly 21:17, 10 April 2007 (UTC)WWF definitions seems to be: 867 Ecoregions of the Earth are assigned to one of 14 biomes (or "major habitat type", MHT)and one of 8 Biogeografical Realms. --Chris.urs-o (talk) 13:28, 16 January 2009 (UTC)The first sentence in the intro is incorrect as it is:  "A biome is a climatically and geographically defined area of ecologically similar climatic ''conditions such as communities of plants, animals, and soil organisms,'' [1] and are often referred to as ecosystems."This basically equates conditions to communities and animals.  Animals are not a condition.  I can't think of suitable words at the moment.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Duboshi (talk • Special:Contributions/Duboshi|contribs) 15:34, 16 February 2009 (UTC);;; ;;:Agree that this is a mess. The Campbell quote doesn't help, although I've seen it on multiple sites (what is "that environment"?) What seems to make sense is to distinguish "habitat types" from biomes. HT's are things like "grasslands" and "rain forests". Biomes are the things that live in particular habitats. I.e., not types. I.e., the biome of the Russian steppes is different from the biome of the American prairie. I.e., they are characterized by their inhabitants, not by the environment. The biomes that occupy a particular HT are interestingly comparable, but not the same. It may help to think about the human microbiome. The HT is "human body", but the MB is "things that live on/in Joe's body". This is conceptually crisp, but may not conform to common usage. In any event, an appropriate source is necessary to avoid OR.

For example, water may circulate between ecosystems by the means of a river or ocean current. Water itself, as a liquid medium, even defines ecosystems.  Some species, such as salmon or freshwater eels move between marine systems and fresh-water systems.  These relationships between the ecosystems lead to the concept of a ''biome''.A biome is a homogeneous ecological formation that exists over a large region as tundra or steppes. The biosphere comprises all of the Earth's biomes -- the entirety of places where life is possible -- from the highest mountains to the depths of the oceans.Biomes correspond rather well to subdivisions distributed along the latitudes, from the equator towards the poles, with differences based on to the physical environment (for example, oceans or mountain ranges) and to the climate. Their variation is generally related to the distribution of species according to their ability to tolerate temperature and/or dryness.  For example, one may find photosynthetic algae only in the ''photic'' part of the ocean (where light penetrates), while conifers are mostly found in mountains.Though this is a simplification of more complicated scheme, latitude and altitude approximate a good representation of the distribution of biodiversity within the biosphere.  Very generally, the richness of biodiversity (as well for animal than plant species) is decreasing most rapidly near the equator (as in Brazil) and less rapidly as one approaches the poles.The biosphere may also be divided into ecozone, which are very well defined today and primarily follow the continental borders.  The ecozones are themselves divided into ecoregions, though there is not agreement on their limits.Plantsurfer (talk) 14:31, 29 December 2007 (UTC)Map Keynot all the colours are represented in the key.

Either they're synonymous or they're not. If they're not, then substituting one term for the other would be inaccurate.
