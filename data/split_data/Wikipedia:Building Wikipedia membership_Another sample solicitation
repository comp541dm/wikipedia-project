I am only now starting to publicize Wikipedia, a wiki-based free (opencontent) encyclopedia project.  We started last January and already haveabout 10,000 articles.  Perhaps you have seen us by now--we're located at. I'm the person responsible for organizing andleading Wikipedia, as well as Nupedia (which has been moving *much* moreslowly).First things first: it would be fantastic if you would like to link to anyor all of our articles.  They're free, of course.  I'd like to make thisas easy as possible for you, if you're interested.If you have any free articles we can use, I would like to know about it!More interestingly, perhaps, for you, is the idea that you can actuallyuse our content as part of your website.  It's free.  The cream of thecrop can be found at ,but there's a *lot* more than that.  Also, the quality of Nupedia articlesis guaranteed; see .  (There justisn't much there yet.)One thing we're working on is a program that will make it extremely easyto mirror Wikipedia's content.  We're not done with that yet--but is thatsomething you might be interested in?I certainly would like to hear back from you about how we might be able tosupport each other.  I do not regard your website as a competitor in anysense at all.:''See also :'' Building Wikipedia membership
