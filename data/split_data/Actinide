The atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki had a plutonium charge.[Manhattan Project. An Interactive History]. US Department of EnergyThe '''actinide'''  or '''actinoid'''  (IUPAC nomenclature) series encompasses the 15 metallic chemical elements with atomic numbers from 89 to 103, actinium through lawrencium., Encyclopædia Britannica on-lineAlthough "actinoid" (rather than "actinide") means "actinium-like" and therefore should exclude actinium, that element is usually included in the series.The actinide series derives its name from the first element in the series, actinium. The informal chemical symbol '''An''' is used in general discussions of actinide chemistry to refer to any actinide. All but one of the actinides are f-block elements, corresponding to the filling of the 5f electron shell; lawrencium, a d-block element, is also generally considered an actinide. In comparison with the lanthanides, also mostly f-block elements, the actinides show much more variable valence. They all have very large atomic and ionic radii and exhibit an unusually large range of physical properties. While actinium and the late actinides (from americium onwards) behave similarly to the lanthanides, the elements thorium through neptunium are much more similar to transition metals in their chemistry.All actinides are radioactive and release energy upon radioactive decay; naturally occurring uranium and thorium, and synthetically produced plutonium are the most abundant actinides on Earth. These are used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Uranium and thorium also have diverse current or historical uses, and americium is used in the ionization chambers of most modern smoke detectors.Of the actinides, primordial thorium and uranium occur naturally in substantial quantities and small amounts of persisting natural plutonium have also been identified. The radioactive decay of uranium produces transient amounts of actinium and protactinium, and atoms of neptunium and plutonium are occasionally produced from transmutation reactions in uranium ores. The other actinides are purely synthetic elements."Gray"Nuclear weapons tests have released at least six actinides heavier than plutonium into the environment; analysis of debris from a 1952 hydrogen bomb explosion showed the presence of americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium and fermium.In presentations of the periodic table, the lanthanides and the actinides are customarily shown as two additional rows below the main body of the table,"Gray"with placeholders or else a selected single element of each series (either lanthanum or lutetium, and either actinium or lawrencium, respectively) shown in a single cell of the main table, between barium and hafnium, and radium and rutherfordium, respectively.  This convention is entirely a matter of aesthetics and formatting practicality; a rarely used wide-formatted periodic table inserts the lanthanide and actinide series in their proper places, as parts of the table's sixth and seventh rows (periods).Discovery, isolation and synthesis{| class="wikitable"  style="float:right; margin-left:1em;"|+Synthesis of transuranium elements!

Within the actinides, there are two overlapping groups: transuranium elements, which follow uranium in the periodic table—and transplutonium elements, which follow plutonium. Compared to the lanthanides, which (except for promethium) are found in nature in appreciable quantities, most actinides are rare. The most abundant, or easy to synthesize actinides are uranium and thorium, followed by plutonium, americium, actinium, protactinium and neptunium.The existence of transuranium elements was suggested by Enrico Fermi based on his experiments in 1934. However, even though four actinides were known by that time, it was not yet understood that they formed a family similar to lanthanides. The prevailing view that dominated early research into transuranics was that they were regular elements in the 7th period, with thorium, protactinium and uranium corresponding to 6th-period hafnium, tantalum and tungsten, respectively. Synthesis of transuranics gradually undermined this point of view. By 1944 an observation that curium failed to exhibit oxidation states above 4 (whereas its supposed 6th period homolog, platinum, can reach oxidation state of 6) prompted Glenn Seaborg to formulate a so-called "actinide hypothesis". Studies of known actinides and discoveries of further transuranic elements provided more data in support of this point of view, but the phrase "actinide hypothesis" (the implication being that "hypothesis" is something that has not been decisively proven) remained in active use by scientists through the late 1950s.At present, there are two major methods of producing isotopes of transplutonium elements: irradiation of the lighter elements with either neutrons or accelerated charged particles. The first method is most important for applications, as only neutron irradiation using nuclear reactors allows the production of sizeable amounts of synthetic actinides; however, it is limited to relatively light elements. The advantage of the second method is that elements heavier than plutonium, as well as neutron-deficient isotopes, can be obtained, which are not formed during neutron irradiation.In 1962–1966, there were attempts in the United States to produce transplutonium isotopes using a series of six underground nuclear explosions. Small samples of rock were extracted from the blast area immediately after the test to study the explosion products, but no isotopes with mass number greater than 257 could be detected, despite predictions that such isotopes would have relatively long half-lives of α-decay. This inobservation was attributed to spontaneous fission owing to the large speed of the products and to other decay channels, such as neutron emission and nuclear fission.From actinium to uraniumFile:Enrico Fermi 1943-49.jpg|thumb|left|Enrico Fermi suggested the existence of transuranium elements in 1934.Uranium and thorium were the first actinides discovered. Uranium was identified in 1789 by the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth in pitchblende ore. He named it after the planet Uranus,g1250which had been discovered only eight years earlier. Klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound (likely sodium diuranate) by dissolving pitchblende in nitric acid and neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide. He then reduced the obtained yellow powder with charcoal, and extracted a black substance that he mistook for metal. Only 60 years later, the French scientist Eugène-Melchior Péligot identified it with uranium oxide. He also isolated the first sample of uranium metal by heating uranium tetrachloride with potassium. The atomic mass of uranium was then calculated as 120, but Dmitri Mendeleev in 1872 corrected it to 240 using his periodicity laws. This value was confirmed experimentally in 1882 by K. Zimmerman.K. Zimmerman, Ann., 213, 290 (1882); 216, 1 (1883); Ber. 15 (1882) 849Thorium oxide was discovered by Friedrich Wöhler in the mineral, which was found in Norway (1827). Jöns Jacob Berzelius characterized this material in more detail by in 1828. By reduction of thorium tetrachloride with potassium, he isolated the metal and named it thorium after the Norse god of thunder and lightning Thor. (modern citation: ''Annalen der Physik'', vol. 92, no. 7, pages 385–415) The same isolation method was later used by Péligot for uranium.g1250Actinium was discovered in 1899 by André-Louis Debierne, an assistant of Marie Curie, in the pitchblende waste left after removal of radium and polonium. He described the substance (in 1899) as similar to titanium and (in 1900) as similar to thorium. The discovery of actinium by Debierne was however questioned in 1971 and 2000, arguing that Debierne's publications in 1904 contradicted his earlier work of 1899–1900. The name actinium comes from the Greek ''aktis, aktinos'' (ακτίς, ακτίνος), meaning beam or ray. This metal was discovered not by its own radiation but by the radiation of the daughter products. Owing to the close similarity of actinium and lanthanum and low abundance, pure actinium could only be produced in 1950. The term actinide was probably introduced by Victor Goldschmidt in 1937.;;Protactinium was possibly isolated in 1900 by William Crookes. It was first identified in 1913, when Kasimir Fajans and Oswald Helmuth Göhring encountered the short-lived isotope 234mPa (half-life 1.17 minutes) during their studies of the 238U decay. They named the new element ''brevium'' (from Latin ''brevis'' meaning brief); the name was changed to ''protoactinium'' (from Greek πρῶτος + ἀκτίς meaning "first beam element") in 1918 when two groups of scientists, led by the Austrian Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn of Germany and Frederick Soddy and John Cranston of Great Britain, independently discovered 231Pa. The name was shortened to ''protactinium'' in 1949. This element was little characterized until 1960, when A. G. Maddock and his co-workers in the U.K. produced 130grams of protactinium from 60 tonnes of waste left after extraction of uranium from its ore.Neptunium and aboveNeptunium (named for the planet Neptune, the next planet out from Uranus, after which uranium was named) was discovered by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson in 1940 in Berkeley, California. They produced the 239Np isotope (half-life = 2.4 days) by bombarding uranium with slow neutrons.g1251It was the first transuranium element produced synthetically.File:Glenn Seaborg - 1964.jpg|thumb|Glenn T. Seaborg and his group at the University of California at Berkeley synthesized Pu, Am, Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm, Md, No and element 106, which was later named seaborgium in his honor while he was still living. They also synthesized more than 100 atomic actinide isotopes.Transuranium elements do not occur in sizeable quantities in nature and are commonly synthesized via nuclear reactions conducted with nuclear reactors. For example, under irradiation with reactor neutrons, uranium-238 partially converts to plutonium-239:: \mathrm{ {}^{238}_{92}U + {}^{1}_{0}n\ \xrightarrow\ \ {}^{239}_{92}U\ \xrightarrow[23.5\ min]{\beta^-}\ {}^{239}_{93}Np\ \xrightarrow[2.3\ days]{\beta^-}\ {}^{239}_{94}Pu\ \xrightarrow[2.4\cdot 10^4\ years]{\alpha} }In this way, Enrico Fermi with collaborators, using the first nuclear reactor Chicago Pile-1, obtained significant amounts of plutonium-239, which were then used in nuclear weapons.Actinides with the highest mass numbers are synthesized by bombarding uranium, plutonium, curium and californium with ions of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, neon or boron in a particle accelerator. So, nobelium was produced by bombarding uranium-238 with neon-22 as: ~\mathrm || 5.485 (84.8) 5.442 (13.1)5.388 (1.66) || 0.059 (35.9)0.026 (2.27) || 1.2714 || 546.1|-|243Am || 7.37(4)3 years || 3.7(2) || 5.275 (87.1)5.233 (11.2)5.181 (1.36) || 0.074 (67.2) 0.043 (5.9) || 7.3912 || 273.3|-|242Cm || 162.8(2) days || 6.2(3) || 6.069 (25.92)6.112 (74.08) || 0.044 (0.04)0.102 (4) || 1.2317 || 7.69|-|244Cm || 18.10(2) years || 1.37(3) || 5.762 (23.6)5.804 (76.4) || 0.043 (0.02)0.100 (1.5) || 2.9615 || 4.19|-|245Cm || 8.5(1)3 years || 6.1(9) || 5.529 (0.58)5.488 (0.83)5.361 (93.2) || 0.175 (9.88)0.133 (2.83) || 6.3512 || 3.94|-|246Cm || 4.76(4)3 years || 0.02615(7) || 5.343 (17.8)5.386 (82.2) || 0.045 (19) || 1.1313 || 2.959|-|247Cm || 1.56(5)7 years || — || 5.267 (13.8)5.212 (5.7)5.147 (1.2) || 0.402 (72)0.278 (3.4) || 3.439 ||—|-|248Cm || 3.48(6)5 years || 8.39(16) || 5.034 (16.52)5.078 (75) ||—|| 1.4011 || 1.2910|-|249Bk || 330(4) days || 4.7(2) || 5.406 (1)5.378 (2.6) || 0.32 (5.8) || 5.8816 || 2.767|-|249Cf || 351(2) years || 5.0(4) || 6.193 (2.46)6.139 (1.33)5.946 (3.33) || 0.388 (66)0.333 (14.6) || 1.5114 || 7.575|-|250Cf || 13.08(9) years || 0.077(3) || 5.988 (14.99)6.030 (84.6) || 0.043 || 4.0415 || 3.1112|-|251Cf || 900(40) years || ? || 6.078 (2.6)5.567 (0.9)5.569 (0.9) || 0.177 (17.3)0.227 (6.8) || 5.8613 ||—|-|252Cf || 2.645(8) years || 3.092(8) || 6.075 (15.2)6.118 (81.6) || 0.042 (1.4)0.100 (1.3) || 1.9216 || 6.1414|-|254Cf || 60.5(2) days || ≈100 || 5.834 (0.26)5.792 (5.3) ||—|| 9.7514 || 3.1317|-|253Es || 20.47(3) days || 8.7(3) || 6.540 (0.85)6.552 (0.71)6.590 (6.6) || 0.387 (0.05)0.429 (8) || 9.3317 || 8.1210|-|254Es || 275.7(5) days || ; 3 || 6.347 (0.75)6.358 (2.6)6.415 (1.8) || 0.042 (100)0.034 (30) || 6.916 ||—|-|255Es || 39.8(12) days || 0.0041(2) || 6.267 (0.78)6.401 (7) ||—|| 4.3817(β)3.8116(α) || 1.9513|-|255Fm || 20.07(7) hours || 2.4(10) || 7.022 (93.4)6.963 (5.04)6.892 (0.62) || 0.00057 (19.1)0.081 (1) || 2.2719 || 5.4412|-|256Fm || 157.6(13) min || 91.9(3) || 6.872 (1.2)6.917 (6.9) ||—||1.5820 || 1.419|-|257Fm || 100.5(2) days || 0.210(4) || 6.752 (0.58)6.695 (3.39)6.622 (0.6) || 0.241 (11)0.179 (8.7) || 1.8717 || 3.9314|-|256Md || 77(2) min ||—|| 7.142 (1.84)7.206 (5.9) ||—||3.5320 ||—|-|257Md || 5.52(5) hours ||—|| 7.074 (14) || 0.371 (11.7)0.325 (2.5) ||8.1719||—|-|258Md || 51.5(3) days ||—|| 6.73||—||3.6417 ||—|-|255No || 3.1(2) min ||—|| 8.312 (1.16)8.266 (2.6)8.121 (27.8) || 0.187 (3.4) || 8.7821 ||—|-|259No || 58(5) min ||—|| 7.455 (9.8)7.500 (29.3)7.533 (17.3) ||—||4.6320||—|-|256Lr || 27(3) s ||; 0.03|| 8.319 (5.4)8.390 (16)8.430 (33) ||—|| 5.9622 ||—|-|257Lr || 646(25) ms ||—|| 8.796 (18)8.861 (82) ||—||1.5424||—|}Actinides have 89 to 103 protons and usually have 117 to 159 neutrons.Thirty-one isotopes of actinium and eight excited isomeric states of some of its nuclides were identified by 2010. Three isotopes, Actinium-225|225Ac, Actinium-227|227Ac and Actinium-228|228Ac, were found in nature and the others were produced in the laboratory; only the three natural isotopes are used in applications. Actinium-225 is a member of radioactive neptunium series; it was first discovered in 1947 as a fission product of uranium-233, it is an α-emitter with a half-life of 10 days. Actinium-225 is less available than actinium-228, but is more promising in radiotracer applications."Himiya aktiniya"Actinium-227 (half-life 21.77 years) occurs in all uranium ores, but in small quantities. One gram of uranium (in radioactive equilibrium) contains only 2-10 gram of 227Ac."Himiya aktiniya""Nubase2003"Actinium-228 is a member of radioactive thorium series formed by the decay of Radium-228|228Ra;g1254it is a β− emitter with a half-life of 6.15 hours. In one tonne of thorium there is 5-8 gram of 228Ac. It was discovered by Otto Hahn in 1906."Himiya aktiniya"Twenty nine isotopes of protactinium are known with mass numbers 212–240"Nubase2003"as well as three excited isomeric states. Only protactinium-231|231Pa and protactinium-234|234Pa have been found in nature. All the isotopes have short lifetime, except for protactinium-231 (half-life 32,760 years). The most important isotopes are 231Pa and protactinium-233|233Pa, which is an intermediate product in obtaining uranium-233 and is the most affordable among artificial isotopes of protactinium. 233Pa has convenient half-life and energy of Gamma radiation|γ-radiation, and thus was used in most studies of protactinium chemistry. Protactinium-233 is a Beta radiation|β-emitter with a half-life of 26.97 days."Nubase2003""Himiya protaktiniya"Uranium has the highest number (25) of both natural and synthetic isotopes. They have mass numbers of 217–242,"tablitsa MAGATE"and three of them, Uranium-234|234U, 235U and 238U, are present in appreciable quantities in nature. Among others, the most important is 233U, which is a final product of transformations of Thorium-232|232Th irradiated by slow neutrons. 233U has a very higher fission efficiency by low-energy (thermal) neutrons, compared e.g. with 235U. Most uranium chemistry studies were carried out on uranium-238 owing to its long half-life of 4.49 years.There are 19 isotopes of neptunium with mass numbers from 225 to 244;"tablitsa MAGATE"they are all highly radioactive. The most popular among scientists are long-lived 237Np (t1/2 = 2.206 years) and short-lived 239Np, 238Np (t1/2 ~ 2 days)."Himiya neptuniya"Sixteen isotopes of americium are known with mass numbers from 232 to 248."tablitsa MAGATE"The most important are 241Am and 243Am, which are alpha-emitters and also emit soft, but intense γ-rays; both of them can be obtained in an isotopically pure form. Chemical properties of americium were first studied with 241Am, but later shifted to 243Am, which is almost 20 times less radioactive. The disadvantage of 243Am is production of the short-lived daughter isotope 239Np, which has to be considered in the data analysis.Among 19 isotopes of curium,"tablitsa MAGATE"the most accessible are 242Cm and 244Cm; they are α-emitters, but with much shorter lifetime than the americium isotopes. These isotopes emit almost no γ-radiation, but undergo spontaneous fission with the associated emission of neutrons. More long-lived isotopes of curium (245–248Cm, all α-emitters) are formed as a mixture during neutron irradiation of plutonium or americium. Upon short irradiation, this mixture is dominated by curium-246, and then curium-248 begins to accumulate. Both of these isotopes, especially 248Cm, have a longer half-life (3.485 years) and are much more convenient for carrying out chemical research than 242Cm and 244Cm, but they also have a rather high rate of spontaneous fission. 247Cm has the longest lifetime among isotopes of curium (1.567 years), but is not formed in large quantities because of the strong fission induced by thermal neutrons.Fourteen isotopes of berkelium were identified with mass numbers 238–252."tablitsa MAGATE"Only 249Bk is available in large quantities; it has a relatively short half-life of 330 days and emits mostly soft Beta decay|β-particles, which are inconvenient for detection. Its alpha radiation is rather weak (1.45-3% with respect to β-radiation), but is sometimes used to detect this isotope. 247Bk is an alpha-emitter with a long half-life of 1,380 years, but it is hard to obtain in appreciable quantities; it is not formed upon neutron irradiation of plutonium because of the β-stability of isotopes of curium isotopes with mass number below 248.m18Isotopes of californium with mass numbers 237–256 are formed in nuclear reactors;"tablitsa MAGATE"californium-253 is a β-emitter and the rest are α-emitters. The isotopes with even mass numbers (250Cf, 252Cf and 254Cf) have a high rate of spontaneous fission, especially 254Cf of which 99.7% decays by spontaneous fission. Californium-249 has a relatively long half-life (352 years), weak spontaneous fission and strong γ-emission that facilitates its identification. 249Cf is not formed in large quantities in a nuclear reactor because of the slow β-decay of the parent isotope 249Bk and a large cross section of interaction with neutrons, but it can be accumulated in the isotopically pure form as the β-decay product of (pre-selected) 249Bk. Californium produced by reactor-irradiation of plutonium mostly consists of 250Cf and 252Cf, the latter being predominant for large neutron fluences, and its study is hindered by the strong neutron radiation.{| class="wikitable"  style="float:right; text-align:center;"|+ Properties of some transplutonium isotope pairs!

The content of actinium in most natural objects corresponds to the isotopic equilibrium of parent isotope 235U, and it is not affected by the weak Ac migration."Himiya aktiniya"Protactinium is more abundant (10−12%) in the Earth's crust than actinium. It was discovered in the uranium ore in 1913 by Fajans and Göhring.fajansAs actinium, the distribution of protactinium follows that of 235U."Himiya protaktiniya"The half-life of the longest-lived isotope of neptunium, Neptunium-237|237Np, is negligible compared to the age of the Earth. Thus neptunium is present in nature in negligible amounts produced as intermediate decay products of other isotopes."Himiya neptuniya"Traces of plutonium in uranium minerals were first found in 1942, and the more systematic results on 239Pu are summarized in the table (no other plutonium isotopes could be detected in those samples). The upper limit of abundance of the longest-living isotope of plutonium, 244Pu, is 3-20%. Plutonium could not be detected in samples of lunar soil. Owing to its scarcity in nature, most plutonium is produced synthetically."katz"ExtractionMonazite—a major thorium mineralOwing to the low abundance of actinides, their extraction is a complex, multistep process. Fluorides of actinides are usually used because they are insoluble in water and can be easily separated with redox reactions. Fluorides are reduced with calcium, magnesium or barium:Golub, pp. 215–217: ~\mathrm{2AmF_3+3Ba \ \xrightarrow{1150-1350^\circ C} \ 3BaF_2+2Am}: ~\mathrm{PuF_4+2Ba \ \xrightarrow{1200^\circ C} \ 2BaF_2+Pu}: ~\mathrm{UF_4+2Mg \ \xrightarrow{;500^\circ C} \ U+2MgF_2}Among the actinides, thorium and uranium are the easiest to isolate. Thorium is extracted mostly from monazite: thorium diphosphate (Th(PO4)2) is reacted with nitric acid, and the produced thorium nitrate treated with tributyl phosphate. Rare-earth impurities are separated by increasing the pH in sulfate solution. g215In another extraction method, monazite is decomposed with a 45% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide at 140°C. Mixed metal hydroxides are extracted first, filtered at 80°C, washed with water and dissolved with concentrated hydrochloric acid. Next, the acidic solution is neutralized with hydroxides to pH = 5.8 that results in precipitation of thorium hydroxide (Th(OH)4) contaminated with ~3% of rare-earth hydroxides; the rest of rare-earth hydroxides remains in solution. Thorium hydroxide is dissolved in an inorganic acid and then purified from the rare earth elements. An efficient method is the dissolution of thorium hydroxide in nitric acid, because the resulting solution can be purified by extraction with organic solvents: g215Separation of uranium and plutonium from nuclear fuelTh(OH)4 + 4 HNO3 → Th(NO3)4 + 4 H2OMetallic thorium is separated from the anhydrous oxide, chloride or fluoride by reacting it with calcium in an inert atmosphere:g1255ThO2 + 2 Ca → 2 CaO + ThSometimes thorium is extracted by electrolysis of a fluoride in a mixture of sodium and potassium chloride at 700–800°C in a graphite crucible. Highly pure thorium can be extracted from its iodide with the crystal bar process.Uranium is extracted from its ores in various ways. In one method, the ore is burned and then reacted with nitric acid to convert uranium into a dissolved state. Treating the solution with a solution of tributyl phosphate (TBP) in kerosene transforms uranium into an organic form UO2(NO3)2(TBP)2. The insoluble impurities are filtered and the uranium is extracted by reaction with hydroxides as (NH4)2U2O7 or with hydrogen peroxide as UO4·2H2O.g215When the uranium ore is rich in such minerals as dolomite, magnesite, etc., those minerals consume much acid. In this case, the carbonate method is used for uranium extraction. Its main component is an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate, which converts uranium into a complex [UO2(CO3)3]4−, which is stable in aqueous solutions at low concentrations of hydroxide ions. The advantages of the sodium carbonate method are that the chemicals have low corrosivity (compared to nitrates) and that most non-uranium metals precipitate from the solution. The disadvantage is that tetravalent uranium compounds precipitate as well. Therefore, the uranium ore is treated with sodium carbonate at elevated temperature and under oxygen pressure::2 UO2 + O2 + 6 2- → 2 [UO2(CO3)3]4−This equation suggests that the best solvent for the uranium carbonate processing is a mixture of carbonate with bicarbonate. At high pH, this results in precipitation of diuranate, which is treated with hydrogen in the presence of nickel yielding an insoluble uranium tetracarbonate.g215Another separation method uses polymeric resins as a polyelectrolyte. Ion exchange processes in the resins result in separation of uranium. Uranium from resins is washed with a solution of ammonium nitrate or nitric acid that yields uranyl nitrate, UO2(NO3)2·6H2O. When heated, it turns into UO3, which is converted to UO2 with hydrogen:: UO3 + H2 → UO2 + H2OReacting uranium dioxide with fluoric acid changes it to uranium tetrafluoride, which yields uranium metal upon reaction with magnesium metal:g1255: 4 HF + UO2 → UF4 + 2 H2OTo extract plutonium, neutron-irradiated uranium is dissolved in nitric acid, and a reducing agent (Iron(II) sulfate|FeSO4, or hydrogen peroxide|H2O2) is added to the resulting solution. This addition changes the oxidation state of plutonium from +6 to +4, while uranium remains in the form of uranyl nitrate (UO2(NO3)2). The solution is treated with a reducing agent and neutralized with ammonium carbonate to pH = 8 that results in precipitation of Pu4+ compounds.g215In another method, Pu4+ and  are first extracted with tributyl phosphate, then reacted with hydrazine washing out the recovered plutonium.g215The major difficulty in separation of actinium is the similarity of its properties with those of lanthanum. Thus actinium is either synthesized in nuclear reactions from isotopes of radium or separated using ion-exchange procedures."Himiya aktiniya"PropertiesActinides have similar properties to lanthanides. The 6''d'' and 7''s'' electronic shells are filled in actinium and thorium, and the 5''f'' shell is being filled with further increase in atomic number; the 4''f'' shell is filled in the lanthanides. The first experimental evidence for the filling of the 5''f'' shell in actinides was obtained by McMillan and Abelson in 1940. As in lanthanides (see lanthanide contraction), the ionic radius of actinides monotonically decreases with atomic number (see also Aufbau principle).Golub, pp. 218–219{| Class = "wikitable collapsible" style = "text-align: center"|+ Properties of actinides (the mass of the most long-lived isotope is in square brackets)"Yu.

All of them are soft and have a silvery color (but tarnish in air), relatively high density and plasticity. Some of them can be cut with a knife. Their electrical resistivity varies between 15 and 150 µOhm·cm."g1263"The hardness of thorium is similar to that of soft steel, so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire. Thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium, but is harder than either of them. All actinides are radioactive, paramagnetic, and, with the exception of actinium, have several crystalline phases: plutonium has seven, and uranium, neptunium and californium three. Crystal structures of protactinium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more similar to those of the 3''d''-transition metals."Yu. D. Tretyakov"All actinides are pyrophoric, especially when finely divided, that is, they spontaneously ignite upon reaction with air.g1264The melting point of actinides does not have a clear dependence on the number of ''f''-electrons. The unusually low melting point of neptunium and plutonium (~640°C) is explained by hybridization of 5''f'' and 6''d'' orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in these metals."Yu. D.

Actinides, especially those with a small number of 5''f''-electrons, are prone to hybridization. This is explained by the similarity of the electron energies at the 5''f'', 7''s'' and 6''d'' shells. Most actinides exhibit a larger variety of valence states, and the most stable are +6 for uranium, +5 for protactinium and neptunium, +4 for thorium and plutonium and +3 for actinium and other actinides.Golub, pp. 222–227Chemically, actinium is similar to lanthanum, which is explained by their similar ionic radii and electronic structure. Like lanthanum, actinium has oxidation of +3, but it is less reactive and has more pronounced basic properties. Among other trivalent actinides Ac3+ is least acidic, i.e. has the weakest tendency to hydrolyze in aqueous solutions. "Himiya aktiniya""Yu. D. Tretyakov"Thorium is rather active chemically. Owing to lack of electrons on 6''d'' and 5''f'' orbitals, the tetravalent thorium compounds are colorless. At pH ; 3, the solutions of thorium salts are dominated by the cations [Th(H2O)8]4+. The Th4+ ion is relatively large, and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95 and 1.14 Å. As a result, thorium salts have a weak tendency to hydrolyse. The distinctive ability of thorium salts is their high solubility, not only in water, but also in polar organic solvents."Yu. D. Tretyakov"Protactinium exhibits two valence states; the +5 is stable, and the +4 state easily oxidizes to protactinium(V). Thus tetravalent protactinium in solutions is obtained by the action of strong reducing agents in a hydrogen atmosphere. Tetravalent protactinium is chemically similar to uranium(IV) and thorium(IV). Fluorides, phosphates, hypophosphate, iodate and phenylarsonates of protactinium(IV) are insoluble in water and dilute acids. Protactinium forms soluble carbonates. The hydrolytic properties of pentavalent protactinium are close to those of tantalum(V) and niobium(V). The complex chemical behavior of protactinium is a consequence of the start of the filling of the 5''f'' shell in this element."Himiya protaktiniya"Uranium has a valence from 3 to 6, the last being most stable. In the hexavalent state, uranium is very similar to the group 6 elements. Many compounds of uranium(IV) and uranium(VI) are non-stoichiometric, i.e. have variable composition. For example, the actual chemical formula of uranium dioxide is UO2+x, where ''x'' varies between −0.4 and 0.32. Uranium(VI) compounds are weak oxidants. Most of them contain the linear "uranyl" group, . Between 4 to 6 ligands can be accommodated in an equatorial plane perpendicular to the uranyl group. The uranyl group acts as a hard acid and forms stronger complexes with oxygen-donor ligands than with nitrogen-donor ligands.  and  are also the common form of Np and Pu in the +6 oxidation state. Uranium(IV) compounds exhibit reducing properties, e.g., they are easily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen. Uranium(III) is a very strong reducing agent. Owing to the presence of d-shell, uranium (as well as many other actinides) forms organometallic compounds, such as UIII(C5H5)3 and UIV(C5H5)4."Yu. D. Tretyakov"Neptunium has valence states from 3 to 7, which can be simultaneously observed in solutions. The most stable state in solution is +5, but the valence +4 is preferred in solid neptunium compounds. Neptunium metal is very reactive. Ions of neptunium are prone to hydrolysis and formation of coordination compounds."Himiya neptuniya"Plutonium also exhibits valence states between 3 and 7 inclusive, and thus is chemically similar to neptunium and uranium. It is highly reactive, and quickly forms an oxide film in air. Plutonium reacts with hydrogen even at temperatures as low as 25–50°C; it also easily forms halides and intermetallic compounds. Hydrolysis reactions of plutonium ions of different oxidation states are quite diverse. Plutonium(V) can enter polymerization reactions."Plutoniy"The largest chemical diversity among actinides is observed in americium, which can have valence between 2 and 6. Divalent americium is obtained only in dry compounds and non-aqueous solutions (acetonitrile). Oxidation states +3, +5 and +6 are typical for aqueous solutions, but also in the solid state. Tetravalent americium forms stable solid compounds (dioxide, fluoride and hydroxide) as well as complexes in aqueous solutions. It was reported that in alkaline solution americium can be oxidized to the heptavalent state, but these data proved erroneous. The most stable valence of americium is 3 in the aqueous solutions and 3 or 4 in solid compounds.Myasoedov, pp. 25–29Valence 3 is dominant in all subsequent elements up to lawrencium (with the possible exception of nobelium). Curium can be tetravalent in solids (fluoride, dioxide). Berkelium, along with a valence of +3, also shows the valence of +4, more stable than that of curium; the valence 4 is observed in solid fluoride and dioxide. The stability of Bk4+ in aqueous solution is close to that of Ce4+. Only valence 3 was observed for californium, einsteinium and fermium. The divalent state is proven for mendelevium and nobelium, and in nobelium it is more stable than the trivalent state. Lawrencium shows valence 3 both in solutions and solids.m25The redox potential ~E_\frac{M^{4+}}{AnO^{2+}_{2}} increases from −0.32 V in uranium, through 0.34 V (Np) and 1.04 V (Pu) to 1.34 V in americium revealing the increasing reduction ability of the An4+ ion from americium to uranium. All actinides form AnH3 hydrides of black color with salt-like properties.

For all actinides, oxides AnO3 are amphoteric and An2O3, AnO2 and An2O5 are basic, they easily react with water, forming bases:g222: An2O3 + 3 H2O → 2 An(OH)3.These bases are poorly soluble in water and by their activity are close to the hydroxides of rare-earth metals. The strongest base is of actinium. All compounds of actinium are colorless, except for black actinium sulfide (Ac2S3). "g222"Dioxides of tetravalent actinides crystallize in the cubic system, same as in calcium fluoride.Thorium reacting with oxygen exclusively forms dioxide:: ~\mathrm{Th+O_2 \ \xrightarrow{1000^\circ C} \ ThO_2}Thorium dioxide is a refractory material with the highest melting point among any known oxide (3390°C)."g1268"Adding 0.8–1% ThO2 to tungsten stabilizes its structure, so the doped filaments have better mechanical stability to vibrations. To dissolve ThO2 in acids, it is heated to 500–600°C; heating above 600°C produces a very resistant to acids and other reagents form of ThO2. Small addition of fluoride ions catalyses dissolution of thorium dioxide in acids.Two protactinium oxides were obtained: PaO2 (black) and Pa2O5(white); the former is isomorphic with ThO2 and the latter is easier to obtain. Both oxides are basic, and Pa(OH)5 is a weak, poorly soluble base.g222Decomposition of certain salts of uranium, for example UO2(NO3)·6H2O in air at 400°C, yields orange or yellow UO3."g1268"This oxide is amphoteric and forms several hydroxides, the most stable being UO2(OH)2.Reaction of uranium(VI) oxide with hydrogen results in uranium dioxide, which is similar in its properties with ThO2. This oxide is also basic and corresponds to the uranium hydroxide (U(OH)4).g222Plutonium, neptunium and americium form two basic oxides: An2O3 and AnO2. Neptunium trioxide is unstable; thus, only Np3O8 could be obtained so far. However, the oxides of plutonium and neptunium with the chemical formula AnO2 and An2O3 are well characterized. g222Salts{| Class = "wikitable collapsible collapsed" style = "text-align: center"|+ Trichlorides of some actinides|-|  style="background:lightblue; text-align:left;"|Chemical formula| AcCl3|| UCl3|| NpCl3|| PuCl3|| AmCl3|| CmCl3|| BkCl3|| CfCl3|-|  style="background:lightblue; text-align:left;"|CAS-number| 22986-54-5|| 10025-93-1|| 20737-06-8|| 13569-62-5|| 13464-46-5|| 13537-20-7|| 13536-46-4|| 13536-90-8|-|  style="background:lightblue; text-align:left;"|Molar mass| 333.386 || 344.387 || 343.406 || 350.32 || 349.42 || 344–358**|| 353.428 || 357.438|-|  style="background:lightblue; text-align:left;"|Melting point||| 837°C||800°C||767°C||715°C||695°C||603°C||545°C|-|  style="background:lightblue; text-align:left;"|Boiling point||| 1657°C||||1767°C||850°C|| || |||-|  style="background:lightblue; text-align:left;"|Crystal structure| Colspan = "8"|The crystal structure of uranium trichloride;br'''An'''3+: __/Cl−: __|-|  style="background:lightblue; text-align:left;"|Space group| Colspan = "8"|P63/m|-|  style="background:lightblue; text-align:left;"|Coordination number| Colspan = "8" |'''An'''*[9], Cl [3]|-|  style="background:lightblue; text-align:left;"|Lattice constants| ''a'' = 762 pm;br''c'' = 455 pm|| ''a'' = 745.2 pm;br''c'' = 432.8 pm|| || ''a'' = 739.4 pm;br''c'' = 424.3 pm|| ''a'' = 738.2 pm;br''c'' = 421.4 pm|| ''a'' = 726 pm;br''c'' = 414 pm|| ''a'' = 738.2 pm;br''c'' = 412.7 pm|| ''a'' = 738 pm ;br''c'' = 409 pm|}:  *'''An''' – actinide ;br**Depending on the isotopes;{| Class = "wikitable collapsible collapsed" style = "text-align: center"|+ Actinide fluorides"Himiya neptuniya""Himiya protaktiniya"g1270Myasoedov, pp. 96–99|-!

So the first berkelium compound, BkCl3, was synthesized in 1962 with an amount of 3 nanograms. Like the halogens of rare earth elements, actinide chlorides, bromides, and iodides are water-soluble, and fluorides are insoluble. Uranium easily yields a colorless hexafluoride, which sublimates at a temperature of 56.5°C; because of its volatility, it is used in the separation of uranium isotopes with gas centrifuge or gaseous diffusion. Actinide hexafluorides have properties close to anhydrides. They are very sensitive to moisture and hydrolyze forming AnO2F2. The pentachloride and black hexachloride of uranium were synthesized, but they are both unstable.g222Action of acids on actinides yields salts, and if the acids are non-oxidizing then the actinide in the salt is in low-valence state:: U + 2 H2SO4 → U (SO4)2 + 2 H2: 2 Pu + 6 HCl → 2 PuCl3 + 3 H2However, in these reactions the regenerating hydrogen can react with the metal, forming the corresponding hydride. Uranium reacts with acids and water much more easily than thorium.g222Actinide salts can also be obtained by dissolving the corresponding hydroxides in acids. Nitrates, chlorides, sulfates and perchlorates of actinides are water-soluble. When crystallizing from aqueous solutions, these salts forming a hydrates, such as Th(NO3)4·6H2O, Th(SO4)2·9H2O and Pu2(SO4)3·7H2O. Salts of high-valence actinides easily hydrolyze. So, colorless sulfate, chloride, perchlorate and nitrate of thorium transform into basic salts with formulas Th(OH)2SO4 and Th(OH)3NO3. The solubility and insolubility of trivalent and tetravalent actinides is like that of lanthanide salts. So phosphates, fluorides, oxalates, iodates and carbonates of actinides are weakly soluble in water; they precipitate as hydrates, such as ThF4·3H2O and Th(CrO4)2·3H2O.g222Actinides with oxidation state +6, except for the AnO22+-type cations, form [AnO4]2−, [An2O7]2− and other complex anions. For example, uranium, neptunium and plutonium form salts of the Na2UO4 (uranate) and (NH4)2U2O7 (diuranate) types. In comparison with lanthanides, actinides more easily form coordination compounds, and this ability increases with the actinide valence. Trivalent actinides do not form fluoride coordination compounds, whereas tetravalent thorium forms K2ThF6, KThF5, and even K5ThF9 complexes. Thorium also forms the corresponding sulfates (for example Na2SO4·Th (SO4)2·5H2O), nitrates and thiocyanates. Salts with the general formula An2Th(NO3)6·''n''H2O are of coordination nature, with the coordination number of thorium equal to 12. Even easier is to produce complex salts of pentavalent and hexavalent actinides. The most stable coordination compounds of actinides – tetravalent thorium and uranium – are obtained in reactions with diketones, e.g. acetylacetone.g222ApplicationsInterior of a smoke detector containing americium-241.While actinides have some established daily-life applications, such as in smoke detectors (americium), Nuclear Issues Briefing Paper 35, May 2002 and gas mantles (thorium), they are mostly used in nuclear weapons and use as a fuel in nuclear reactors.g1255The last two areas exploit the property of actinides to release enormous energy in nuclear reactions, which under certain conditions may become self-sustaining chain reaction.File:Cerenkov Effect.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Self-illumination of a nuclear reactor by Cherenkov radiation.The most important isotope for nuclear power applications is uranium-235. It is used in the thermal reactor, and its concentration in natural uranium does not exceed 0.72%. This isotope strongly absorbs thermal neutrons releasing much energy. One fission act of 1gram of 235U converts into about 1 MW·day. Of importance, is that 235U emits more neutrons than it absorbs;Golub, pp. 220–221 upon reaching the critical mass, 235U enters into a self-sustaining chain reaction. Typically, uranium nucleus is divided into two fragments with the release of 2–3 neutrons, for example:: ~\mathrm**External linksActinides
