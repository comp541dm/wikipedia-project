'''Alex D. Baxter's''' HomepageI found the Wikipedia (from [Slashdot] as I recall) in late 2001, and dipped my toes in the wiki-water by copyediting a couple of articles in early 2002.  I haven't yet found a topic I feel confident enough with to start a new article though!My field is database application development, specifically for clinical trials, so I have professional interests spanning various aspects of computing, medicine, and statistics.
