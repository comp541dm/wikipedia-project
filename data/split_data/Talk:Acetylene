UntitledBryan, I note the very close similarity between this acetylene article and the one I put under "Links."  This is almost too close for comfort...actually it ''is'' too close for comfort.Perhaps, if the article were developed further, it wouldn't look so much like copyright infringement. --LMSNot sure what to do with it other than simply rearranging the sentances more and perhaps substituting synonyms; this is pretty close to a simple list of facts, and facts are uncopyrightable. I'll give it a shot, though. -BD:Which article?What's that stuff?What is the black substance that comes off from the flame and floats away into the air when starting up an oxy-acetelyne torch?:Lampblack.

The opinion that the sweet smell of pureC2H2 is pleasant is not in accord with my experience.  The lastparagraph is in dire need of rewriting.  Its only partiallyintelligible and has garbled syntax and grammar.  One of yourlinks states that polymerization can occur at 15 psig.  So whichis it?  The 1st paragraph has a run on sentence that is one forthe books.  Is it transported in acetone?  If so then why notmention it.  Whats the pressure in a tank or a tanker?No mention of toxicity.  400 C is NOT a low temperature for ahydrocarbon (with multiple bonds).Acetylene can be easily stored in pressurized gas cylinders. What do you think how people weld? They have to tanks oxygen and acetylene. The acetylene is definetely not dissolved in acetone. It is correct that acetylene may explade at 100 kPa pressure (which is 1 atmosphere) but only in the presence of oxygen. It won't do anything on its own. Also the acetylene oxygene flame is one of the hottest burning flame of any hydrocarbon we know:From my distant memory Acetylene will decompose at around 15psi spontaneously, releasing lots of energy (in an explosion).  It is stored in Acetone in welding cylinders to prevent this (as it dissolves readily and thus has a lower partial pressure).  There are hotter flames using different oxidisers or reducers, but acetylene + oxygen is the hottest hydrocarbon - oxygen flame AFAIK. --njh 11:41, 25 May 2006 (UTC)Acetylene or ethyneWhy does the article claim that the chemical name of the compound is acetylene when it should be ethyne? In alkyne it states that the acetylene is officially known as ethyne which I assume is refering to IUPAC nomenclature.* I think that we should use IUPAC names everywhere and then have redirects from common names, rather than the alternative. But it'll never happen.Jaredjeya (talk) 20:56, 7 November 2014 (UTC)::I think we should follow the usage of most recent textbooks and scientific articles. IUPAC is not the only authority. Dirac66 (talk) 14:13, 9 November 2014 (UTC)Why "acetylene"?Why is the compound even called acetylene at all? I see no similarities to the acetyl radical.

There are already redirects in place for "ethine" and "ethyne". Just add a sentence in the article that explains the confusion between acetylene and ethyne and be done with it.Bizzako 2:28, 02 August 2006 (MDT):Don't change it to ethyne.  I'm a chemist and I call it acetylene.  Most simple, common chemical compounds are primarily known by their trivial (non-systematic) names.  Check out [this page] - it is an online version of IUPAC's Blue Book (organic nomenclature bible).  It categorically states that the name acetylene is retained.  That's straight from the horse's mouth.:What WP editors seem to be confused about is the difference between rigidly systematic nomenclature and IUPAC recommendations.  Although in schools, we are generally taught to always use the systematic name, this is in fact for the purposes of education and to not overload students by making them learn loads of trivial names off by heart.  In scientific practice and in general commercial and industrial settings, calling acetylene by the name ethyne would usually be considered to be excessively pedantic and would most likely cause confusion.:In response to Blonde2max's comments, yes ethanol is generally called ethanol by chemists, but acetaldehyde is generally '''not''' called ethanal, nor is formaldehyde ever called methanal.  Toluene is always used in preference to methylbenzene, as are many, many other compounds.  Acetone, not propanone.  Acetic acid, not ethanoic acid.  The list goes on.  Keep this page called acetylene.:Ben 21:05, 2 August 2006 (UTC):: I would disagree that formaldehyde is never called methanal, as well as other examples you give. It really depends on the generation of the person involved, especially when the IUPAC name is less cumbersome than the trivial one eg ethanal v acetaldehyde. In addition of course the IUPAC names reveal the relationships between different chemicals and avoid the silly situation of talking about say methanol being metabolised into formaldehyde when methanol to methanal would be much simpler.

And mind you, ethanoic acid, ethanal, methanal and propanone are the more commonly used forms of names in MODERN chemical literature. Trivial names are more often still used for complex yet common substances, such as toluene, glucose, etc. Special:Contributions/129.67.54.6|129.67.54.6 (talk) 18:46, 20 January 2009 (UTC):The modern chemical literature almost always calls HC≡CH acetylene, and the same goes for H3C-CO2H (always acetic acid), H3C-CHO always acetaldehyde), (H3C)2C=O (always acetone) and so on. I just checked SciFinder and Web of Science for HC≡CH in papers published since 2000. 8227 papers contain "acetylene", while only 439 refer to "ethyne" (ratio of 19:1). I checked a few of the papers that do contain the word "ethyne", and all of them had it as part of a longer name, such as phenyltrimethylsilylethyne in [''Chem. Eur. J.'' '''2008''', ''14'', 11557–11564].:Ben (talk) 16:29, 2 February 2009 (UTC)::I wouldn't argue that ethanal is more common than acetaldehyde, but to say it is ''always'' acetaldehyde is plainly incorrect.

Booshank (talk) 19:29, 2 February 2009 (UTC):There are a few chemistry papers that use "ethanal" (although one of those papers was a physics one), but acetaldehyde is ''far'' more common (ethanal 77, acetaldehyde 4983, ratio 65:1, WoS, 2000-2009). Similarly, ethanoic acid 114 papers, acetic acid 22809, ratio 200:1 and methanal 69, formaldehyde 12381, ratio 179:1.:I think you see the point. You're right that there's nothing incorrect about ethyne etc, but the article name should clearly remain acetylene.:Ben (talk) 19:46, 2 February 2009 (UTC):: I am ''not'' arguing for the page to be renamed Ethyne as it is obviously not the most commonly used term, which is the Wikipedia criteria. I prefer ethyne as it is more logical and more concise in my opinion, but that is beside the point. What I am arguing for is against an unnecessary snootiness in regards to the systematic names and that the name ethyne should be prominent in the article as a) it is considered acceptable by IUPAC and is to be found in scientific literature and b) it is the name most encounter when learning chemistry. Acetylene is not a substance in everyday use by most people and therefore ethyne will be the only name encountered by many. Booshank (talk) 22:50, 2 February 2009 (UTC):Be bold and make the changes you think appropriate. Then we can discuss them here. Make sure it's clear that acetylene outnumbers ethyne in the literature by around 20:1.:You say that most people don't encounter acetylene (depends how you mean encounter!) but I've known there is a substance called acetylene since I was about six years old (probably because of oxy-acetylene lamps), yet I only came across the term ethyne when I was 14 and studying GCSE science. I don't think alkynes were actually on the syllabus so I might not have seen the word ethyne until I did A-level chemistry, aged 17. Considering that most people do not take chemistry beyond GCSE (and probably a similar situation worldwide), I imagine the majority of the public have heard the term acetylene and not ethyne.:Ben (talk) 08:09, 9 March 2009 (UTC)bad wording?

However, on the torch tips I know of, the acetylene and oxygen streams combine externally after exiting individual holes -- the water could entrain the gases and prevent them from mixing and igniting or maintaining ignition.

My argon tank lays on its side in a cradle under my welding bench.I think it's safer to have gas tanks lay on their sides and not standing up as they could not tip over if they are already laying on their sides.I don't want to change the article because I only heard this as a rumor.

If acetone gets up to the valve and it can easily when the container is lying down you will have difficulties lighting up the torch.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/212.91.126.148|212.91.126.148 (talk) 05:59, 20 September 2011 (UTC);; ;;I grew up with a story, from my father in some sort of chemistry, that the cylinders were acetylene in acetone in bentonite, and that laying down the cylinder would release the acetone from the bentonite and cause uncomfortable amounts of acetylene to come out of solution.

Beginning of old comment (added 2005 Oct.1 by numbered editor)Please correct the following:a liquid does not sublime, by definition.A material can not sublime at its boiling point, again by definition (although there may be exceptions...)The boiling point can not be BELOW the melting point (under thesame pressure and temperature). Etc.2. Added today by Marenero::I changed the melting point to the latest (1931) value reported in the webbook 171.65 K (link: Marenero (talk) 20:49, 16 July 2012 (UTC)3. My comment: First, the phase behavior of acetylene is now explained in the article sectionPhysical properties: changes of state. The triple point is at pressure higher than 1 atm, so the liquid can not exist at 1 atm (as for the better known case of CO2). The value given for the melting point is actually the triple point, and the value given for the boiling point is actually the sublimation point at 1 atm, and yes, this is lower than the triple point (again as for CO2).Since melting point here actually means triple point, the latest value reported in the webbook is actually the 1950 value reported as a triple point, which is 192.4 K. This is close to the webbook values from before 1931, suggesting that the 1931 value is an error. The value in the article before today was actually this 1950 value fron the webbook.Other more recent sources agree. The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics (60th edn 1979-80, page C-302) lists the melting point of ethyne as -80.8 oC, which is 192.35 K. And the Merck Index (13th edn 2001, p.17) says -81 oC with ''subl'' in parentheses. Therefore I suggest we return to the 1950 value. The infobox does note that it is the triple point at 1.27 atm, with more detailed explanation in the Physical properties section.
