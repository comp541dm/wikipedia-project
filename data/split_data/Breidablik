In Norse mythology, '''Breiðablik''' (''Broad-gleaming'') is the home of Baldr. It is briefly described in Snorri Sturluson's ''Gylfaginning'' as one of the halls of Asgard::"Then there is also in that place the abode called Breidablik, and there is not in heaven a fairer dwelling."Later in the work, when Snorri describes Baldr, he gives a longer description, citing ''Grímnismál'', though he does not name the poem::"He dwells in the place called Breidablik, which is in heaven; in that place may nothing unclean be, even as is said here:::Breidablik 't is called, | where Baldr has:::A hall made for himself:::In that land | where I know lie:::Fewest baneful runes."''Gylfaginning'' XXII, Brodeur's translation. The strophe is ''Grímnismál'' 12.Breiðablik is not otherwise mentioned in the Eddic sources.See also*Breiðablik UBK, an Icelandic sports club.*Breidablik Peak, a mountain named after Breidablik.Notes;referencesReferences* Bellows, Henry Adams (transl.)
