The '''String Quartet No. 16''' in F major, op. 135, by Ludwig van Beethoven  was written in October 1826 and was the last substantial work he finished. Only the last movement of the Quartet op. 130, written as a replacement for the Große Fuge, was written later. The op. 135 quartet was premiered by the Schuppanzigh Quartet in March 1828.The work is on a smaller scale than his other late quartets. For the third movement, Beethoven used variation techniques; he also did this in the second movement of his Quartet op. 127.Bernard Jacobson. "Beethoven: The Complete String Quartets." EMI 5736062.
