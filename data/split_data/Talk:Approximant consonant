Edit needed in first sentenceI would just ''make'' the edit myself, but I am sick unto death of having edits immediately reverted for unconvincing reasons by people who seem to "own" ''everything'' around here, and to "know" better than everyone else. I see a person who is ''prominently'' this way on this very Talk page, so I'm not '''''about''''' to invite that Supreme Being Edit Warrior to start stomping all over any contribution I would otherwise make. At least here on the Talk page, what I write is not subject to the smiting hand of such a deity. (Sorry to all the rest of you for the tone; but by now, thanks to a couple such ''Wikipenes'' I've had the great misfortune to run into, I have lost all interest in making my own edits — I take no pleasure in the prospect of having an attempted contribution instantly vaporized.)So perhaps the God of Linguistics (and apparently various other subjects) would like to take this following observation under consideration, and if it please the Majesty, perhaps to make a corresponding change, if the Majesty deem it worthy. To wit:It seems to me that in this first sentence::'''Approximants''' are speech sounds (phonemes) that could be regarded as intermediate between vowels and typical consonants....there is no place for the word "phoneme", since a phoneme is an abstract cognitive unit within the phonology of a specific language, which merely ''corresponds'' to an identifiable set of one or more physical sounds possessing realized physical properties. Clearly, some would say a phoneme ''is'' that set of physical sounds, itself; and this may well be the definition of a more empiricist or positivist school of linguistics — see e.g. the brief definition "Phoneme, a set of phones that are cognitively equivalent" given under "See Also" in the Phone article (and then contrast it with the definition given in the Phoneme article itself... — but where I come from, linguistics is a branch of cognitive psychology, where a phoneme is a single unit that is "real" ''only'' on a cognitive, i.e. abstract, psychological, level, and hence will ''correspond'' to a physical set of allophones, but cannot ''be'' that set.So '''"long story long"''' as it were, finally I suggest simply that the first sentence be modified to read "phones" instead of "phonemes"::'''Approximants''' are speech sounds (phones) that could be regarded as intermediate between vowels and typical consonants.I would pick at other details, such as the notion of a "typical" consonant, but I would not wish to make the God(s?) angry. So I leave all such to You in Your infinite wisdom to decide.Wikipedia is a nice ''idea'', and obviously I still wish to see it improved; but human nature being what it is, I shall have to settle for the occasional verbose *suggestion* here on these talk pages which I hope others will take into their own hands. Myself, I have little stomach for actual editing, as it seems almost inevitably to lead to bowing the knee to one or more of the Ba‘als. DevilInTheDetails (talk) 04:49, 19 October 2008 (UTC)Difference from schwa?How is this different from a schwa?:A schwa is a vowel of indeterminate quality -- usually a "reduced" one. Approximants are consonants, albeit pronounced with a greater opening of the vocal tract than other kinds of consonant. They are distinguished more by their unique resonance than by any kind of "sound effect" produced in the mouth (like the sound of friction or the final burst accompanying a stop articulation). Piotr GasiorowskiMapudungun's high central vowel and its corresponding approximantMapudungun has three high vowel sounds: ,  and a high central unrounded vowel, , transcribed usually as "ü".It also has  and , and a voiced unrounded velar consonant that's described in most textbooks as a fricative sound  and transcribed usually as "q".This sound is described by Felix José de Augusta as "the ü, written this way because of it similarity with a mispronounced «g», in words like naq, leq."; other texts also note a correspondence between this sound and , in the same way that  corresponds to  and  corresponds to . It may very well be an approximant: .I found the following recordings (GFDL) which seem to illustrate my point:liq  ("white"):trukür  ("fog"):Locoluis 06:21, 15 February 2006 (UTC):Thanks - unfortunately, those are a single link.:If this really is the consonantal version of a central vowel, then perhaps it is [j;/s;] rather than ? That would be interesting. kwami 06:28, 15 February 2006 (UTC)::Fixed. LocoluiUser_talk:Locoluis|s;#778;.:::Listening to the first one, it sounds more like a diphthong than a vowel plus consonant. But that's perhaps a naive impression. The second does sound more like an approximant, almost like a Usonian English /r/. Too bad the beginning is clipped - I've always been curious about that ;lt;tr;. kwami 06:59, 15 February 2006 (UTC):::I'll put it in the article as a possibility.

See Locoluis (talk) 14:20, 3 September 2008 (UTC)On the main page,  appears (at least on my computer, United States, Windows 7, IE 9) as an unadorned [j]. It should be changed to something readable like [j;/s;], even if it's not official IPA. Or if there's a code for overstrike, you could overstrike a dotless j with an umlaut.

This sound does not correspond with any of the r sounds mentioned in this page or in This is mentioned in Costa_Rican_Spanish however but even there it is not specified in detail. Basically I have been unable to find which is the name and IPA symbol for this sound.It is more similar to Voiced_retroflex_fricative however with a clear vibration. Like a f sound in English vibrated turns to v. Voiced retroflex fricative vibrated turns to this Costa Rican r.If there is any expert in this I would like to give you a call or send a recording. Acuna007 (talk) 04:28, 30 May 2012 (UTC):If there is vibration, it cannot be an approximant. Your description suggests a retroflex trill to me. --Florian Blaschke (talk) 12:53, 23 October 2012 (UTC)Spanish examplesI think some of the examples are wrong (or inappropriate). For example, I'm quite sure pronouncing "abyecto" as [aβˈjek.to] is wrong. I pronounce it as [ab'dʒek.to] and I'm sure many (if not all) Spanish-speakers would pronounce it the same way. Some of the examples are right but inappropriate. Most people don't say [am'plja.mos] or [ac'twa.mos], but [am.pli'a.mos] and [ac.tu'a.mos]. I propose that we use clearer examples. Special:Contributions/81.172.74.15|81.172.74.15 (talk) 04:36, 17 December 2013 (UTC):Were are you from? Pronouncing y as [(d)ʒ] is a dialectal phenomenon in parts of South America. And would you really be able to distinguish between [am'plja.mos] and [am.pli.'a.mos]? Most people aren't. That said, often speakers of Spanish pronounce /j/ not as an approximant, but as a fricative [ʝ]. --JorisvS (talk) 09:47, 17 December 2013 (UTC)
