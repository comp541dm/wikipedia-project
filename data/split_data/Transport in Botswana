Map of BotswanaA sparsely populated, arid country, '''Botswana''' has nonetheless managed to incorporate much of its interior into the national economy.  An "inner circle" highway connecting all major towns and district capitals is completely paved, and the all-weather Trans-Kalahari Highway connects the country (and, through it, South Africa's commercially dominant Gauteng Province) to Walvis Bay in Namibia.RailwaysBotswana RailwaysBotswana possesses 888km of 1067mm gauge railway, by 2019 figures, serving a number of towns and connecting the country to its neighbours.Towns served by railRailway stations in BotswanaAll passenger services have been suspended in Botswana, with the only remaining service being an international link to Zimbabwe from Francistown, the only railway station that is still in service. Freight trains still operate. Passenger service was expected to resume in late 2015.HighwaysBotswana "caution curves" sign.Botswana possesses 10,217km of highway, of which 5,620km are paved.  Since 1996 estimates, there has been a significant reduction in the total length of unpaved highway in Botswana - between 1996 and 1999 total length of unpaved highway fell from 14,139km to 4,597km.Traditionally, road signs in Botswana used blue backgrounds rather than the yellow, white, or orange which the rest of the world uses on traffic warning signs. In the early 2010s, officials announced plans to begin phasing out the distinctive blue signs in favor of more typical signs in order to be more in line with the neighboring Southern African Development Community member states.AirportsList of airports in BotswanaIn 2004 there were an estimated 85 airports, 10 of which (as of 2005), were paved.
