They patented the cinematograph, which in contrast to Edison's "peepshow" kinetoscope allowed simultaneous viewing by multiple parties.Their first film ''Sortie de l'usine Lumière de Lyon' (1895) is considered the "first true motion picture."HistoryThe Lumière brothers were born in Besançon, France to Charles-Antoine Lumière (1840-1911)[ and Jeanne Joséphine Costille Lumière, who were married in 1861 and moved to Besancon, setting up a small photographic portrait studio where Auguste and Louise were born. They moved to Lyon in 1870, where son Edouard and three daughters were born.  Auguste and Louis both attended La Martiniere, the largest technical school in Lyon.  Their father Charles-Antoine set up a small factory producing photographic plates, but even with Louis and a young sister working from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. it teetered on the verge of bankruptcy, and by 1882 it looked as if they would fail, but when Auguste returned from military service the boys designed the machines necessary to automate  their father's plate production and devised a very successful new photo plate, 'etiquettes bleue', and by 1884 the factory employed a dozen workers."vc"File:Institut Lumière - CINEMATOGRAPHE Camera.jpg|thumb|Cinématographe Lumière at the Institut Lumière, FranceIt was not until their father retired in 1892 that the brothers began to create moving pictures. They patented a number of significant processes leading up to their film camera, most notably film perforations (originally implemented by Emile Reynaud) as a means of advancing the film through the camera and projector. The original cinématographe had been patented by Léon Guillaume Bouly on 12 February 1892.  The brothers patented their own version on 13 February 1895.  The first footage ever to be recorded using it was recorded on March 19, 1895. This first film shows workers leaving the Lumière factory.The Lumières brothers saw film as a novelty and had withdrawn from the film business in 1905. They went on to develop the first practical photographic color process, the Lumière Autochrome.First film screeningsThe Lumières held their first private screening of projected motion pictures in 1895.Chardère (1985), p.71. This first screening on March 22, 1895 took place in Paris, at the "Society for the Development of the National Industry", in front of an audience of 200 people – among which Léon Gaumont, then director of the Comptoir de la photographie. The main focus of this conference by Louis Lumière were the recent developments in the photograph industry, mainly the research on polychromy (color photography). It was much to Lumière's surprise that the moving black-and-white images retained more attention than the colored stills photographs. The American Woodville Latham had screened works of film seven months earlier, but the first public screening of films at which admission was charged was held on December 28, 1895, at Salon Indien du Grand Café in Paris. This history-making presentation featured ten short films, including their first film, ''Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory|Sortie des Usines Lumière à Lyon'' (''Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory''). Each film is 17 meters long, which, when hand cranked through a projector, runs approximately 50 seconds.Image:Cinématographe Lumière.jpg|thumb|right|190px|The world's first film poster, for 1895's ''L'Arroseur arrosé'' It is believed their first film was actually recorded that same year (1895)Chardère (1987), p.70: The date of the recording of their first film is in dispute. In an interview with Georges Sadoul given in 1948, Louis Lumière tells that he shot the film in August 1894. This is questioned by historians (Sadoul, Pinel, Chardère) who consider that a functional Lumière camera didn't exist before the end of 1894, and that their first film was recorded March 19th 1895, and then publicly projected March 22nd at the Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale in Paris. with Léon Bouly's cinematographe|cinématographe device, which was patented the previous year. The cinématographe — a three-in-one device that could record, develop, and project motion pictures — was further developed by the Lumières.The public debut at the Grand Café came a few months later and consisted of the following ten short films (in order of presentation):.

Their actuality films, or ''actualités'', are often cited as the first, primitive documentaries. They also made the first steps towards comedy film with the slapstick of ''L'Arroseur Arrosé''.Early color photographyImage:LumiereAlgerijnen.jpg|thumb|Autochrome color picture by Jean-Baptiste Tournassoud of North-African soldiers, Oise, France, 1917.The brothers stated that "the cinema is an invention without any future" and declined to sell their camera to other filmmakers such as Georges Méliès. This made many film makers upset. Consequently, their role in the history of film was exceedingly brief. In parallel with their cinema work they experimented with colour photography.  They worked on a number of colour photographic processes in the 1890s including the Lippmann process (interference heliochromy) and their own 'bichromated glue' process, a subtractive colour process, examples of which were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900.  This last process was commercialised by the Lumieres but commercial success had to wait for their next colour process.  In 1903 they patented a colour photographic process, the "Autochrome Lumière", which was launched on the market in 1907. Throughout much of the 20th century, the Lumière company was a major producer of photographic products in Europe, but the brand name, Lumière, disappeared from the marketplace following  merger with Ilford. They also invented the color plate which really got photography on the road.Other early cinematographersThe Lumière Brothers were not the only ones to claim the title of the first cinematographers. The scientific chronophotography devices developed by Eadweard Muybridge, Étienne-Jules Marey and Ottomar Anschütz in the 1880s were able to produce moving photographs, as was William Friese-Greene's 'chronophotographic' system, demonstrated in 1890, and Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope (developed by W K-L Dickson), premiered in 1891. Since 1892, the projected drawings of Émile Reynaud's Théâtre Optique were attracting Paris crowds to the Museé Grevin. Louis Le Prince and Claude Mechant had been shooting moving picture sequences on paper film as soon as 1888, but had never performed a public demonstration. Polish inventor, Kazimierz Prószyński had built his camera and projecting device, called Pleograph, in 1894. Max and Emil Skladanowsky, inventors of the Bioscop, had offered projected moving images to a paying public one month earlier (November 1, 1895, in Berlin). Nevertheless, film historians consider the Grand Café screening to be the true birth of the cinema as a commercial medium, because the Skladanowsky brothers' screening used an extremely impractical dual system motion picture projector that was immediately supplanted by the Lumiere cinematographe.Although the Lumière brothers were not the first inventors to develop techniques to create motion pictures, they are often credited as among the first inventors of the technology for Cinema as a mass medium, and are among the first who understood how to use it.See alsoFile:Lumière House Lyon.jpg|right|thumb|Their house in Lyon, France, is now the Institut Lumière museum.*1895 in film*1896 in film*19th century in film*History of film*L'Idéal Cinéma Jacques Tati in Aniche the oldest still-active cinéma in the world, though not continuously, since November 23, 1905.*List of works by Louis BotinellyReferencesFurther reading* Chardère, B.; Borgé, G. and M.
