Hermaphrodite and Androgynous (botany)The edit comment discussions are so much more fun, but tragically I don't have an edit to go with my comment this time.  To answer User:Marshman's query: when I say that "hermaphroditic" and "androgynous" are still used as synonyms for "bisexual" in botanical terminology I'm basing this on fairly technical, recently published books I have perused that use these terms, as well as widespread use on the WWW.  Botanical use of hermaphrodite is also supported be MerWeb.  MerWeb also basically indicates that bisexual, hermaphrodite, and androgynous are generally synonymous (including allowing "hemaphrodite" as an adjective :p).  I said "popular" use because you suggested they are no longer preferred by professional botanists; I wouldn't know; MerWeb is not a very technical source.  --Chinasaur 01:05, 8 Sep 2004 (UTC)Article titleSurely this should be at Bisexual (disambiguation), as bisexuality is a much more frequent use of the term. Also, the third bullet point (including the point about bonobo monkeys), isn't a separate term, merely a paragraph that should be added to the article bisexuality, surely? ;mdash; OwenBlacker 23:48, July 24, 2005 (UTC): I was thinking the same thing. I am going to go ahead and move it, it has no sense being here. --Waterspyder 20:30, 3 December 2005 (UTC):: I agree. Moving it now. -- OliverL 10:43, 6 January 2006 (UTC)
