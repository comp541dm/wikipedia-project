UntitledI assume something should be said on Cultural movement about the Enlightenment. However, I personally have no idea what.  :-)Any takers?  (27 September 2001)----* See also periodization.* Consider moving or copying the style lists into respective genres, once the genre pages exist.* Article's generalizations seem to be compatible with high school world history texts.* Renaissance shouldn't be called the "golden age of theater and architecture".* It is "tricky" to pick date ranges for the various "renaissances" in different areas.----Actually, I think the most "tricky" part about this article is that there is very little info offered about cultural movements in non-Western cultures?  Granted, I'm no expert on the subject (and will reluctantly admit to having not adequately studied in this area of sociology/anthropology) but I feel pretty certain similar movements of cultural change could be ID'd in other areas of the world at other time periods.  The spread of Buddhism throughout India ; SE Asia perhaps?  The cultural effects of industrialization in Japan (or would that qualify as cultural imperialism?).  Or how about the addition of horses to the lifestyles ; societies of theindigenous peoples of the American Great Plains?  (21 Ocotober 2001)From the article::Incidentalism Commensing 1995 and ongoing Idiosyntactix incident. Zen-like theorectical and practical applications of the unpreconceived. Incidentalism holds all art as both original and derivative. Artifact (or commodity) is the result of artistic practice. Art objects may be owned; however, all intellectual property is fraud.So, you're saying that "Incidentalism" is a major cultural movement, comparable with the others listed here, rather than a small group of web pranksters?  Please justify this with evidence from independent sources.
