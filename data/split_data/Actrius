The film had first screened at the same location in 1998. It was also shown at the 1997 Stockholm International Film Festival.SFFReceptionIn ''Movie - Film - Review'', ''Daily Mail'' staffer Christopher Tookey wrote that though the actresses were "competent in roles that may have some reference to their own careers", the film "is visually unimaginative, never escapes its stage origins, and is almost totally lacking in revelation or surprising incident".TookeyNoting that there were "occasional, refreshing moments of intergenerational bitchiness", they did not "justify comparisons to ''All About Eve''", and were "insufficiently different to deserve critical parallels with ''Rashomon''".TookeyHe also wrote that ''The Guardian'' called the film a "slow, stuffy chamber-piece", and that ''The Evening Standard'' stated the film's "best moments exhibit the bitchy tantrums seething beneath the threesome's composed veneers".  MRQE wrote "This cinematic adaptation of a theatrical work is true to the original, but does not stray far from a theatrical rendering of the story."Awards and nominations* 1997, won 'Best Catalan Film' at Butaca Awards for Ventura Pons* 1997, won 'Best Catalan Film Actress' at Butaca Awards, shared by Núria Espert, Rosa Maria Sardà, Anna Lizaran, and Mercè Pons* 1998, nominated for 'Best Screenplay' at Goya Awards, shared by Josep Maria Benet i Jornet and Ventura PonsReferencesExternal links* Actresses*  as archived February 17, 2009 (Spanish)
