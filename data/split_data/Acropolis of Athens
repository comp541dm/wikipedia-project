Acropolis (neighbourhood)The '''Acropolis of Athens''' (;Thucydides 2.15.3: "ἡ Ἀκρόπολις ἡ νῦν οὖσα πόλις ῆν".  ''Akrópoli Athinón'') is an ancient citadel located on a high rocky outcrop above the city of Athens and contains the remains of several ancient buildings of great architectural and historic significance, the most famous being the Parthenon.  The word  acropolis comes from the Greek  words  (''akron'', "highest point, extremity") and  (''polis'', "city").acro-. (n.d.). In Greek, Acropolis means "Highest City".  ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition. Retrieved September 29, 2008,  Quote: "[From Greek ''akros'', extreme; see  ''ak-'' in Indo-European roots.]" Although there are many other acropoleis in Greece, the significance of the Acropolis of Athens is such that it is commonly known as "The Acropolis" without qualification.While there is evidence that the hill was inhabited as far back as the fourth millennium BC, it was Pericles (c. 495 – 429 BC) in the fifth century BC who coordinated the construction of the site's most important buildings including the Parthenon, the Propylaia, the Erechtheion and the Temple of Athena Nike.["History"], Odysseus.

It was also known as '''Cecropia''', after the legendary serpent-man, Cecrops, the first Athenian king.While the earliest artifacts date to the Middle Neolithic era, there have been documented habitations in Attica from the Early Neolithic (6th millennium BC). There is little doubt that a Mycenaean megaron stood upon the hill during the late Bronze Age. Nothing of this megaron survives except, probably, a single limestone column-base and pieces of several sandstone steps. Soon after the palace was constructed, a Cyclopean massive circuit wall was built, 760 meters long, up to 10 meters high, and ranging from 3.5 to 6 meters thick. This wall would serve as the main defense for the acropolis until the 5th century. The wall consisted of two parapets built with large stone blocks and cemented with an earth mortar called ''emplekton'' (Greek: ἔμπλεκτον).,Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library The wall follows typical Mycenaean convention in that  it followed the natural contour of the terrain and its gate was arranged obliquely, with a parapet and tower overhanging the incomers' right-hand side, thus facilitating defense. There were two lesser approaches up the hill on its north side, consisting of steep, narrow flights of steps cut in the rock.  Homer is assumed to refer to this fortification when he mentions the "strong-built House of Erechtheus" (''Odyssey'' 7.81). At some point before the 13th century BC, an earthquake caused a fissure near the northeastern edge of the Acropolis. This fissure extended some 35 meters to a bed of soft marl in which a well was dug. An elaborate set of stairs was built and the well served as an invaluable, protected source of drinking water during times of siege for some portion of the Mycenaean period.["The springs and fountains of the Acropolis hill"], Hydria Project. Retrieved 2 December 2012.The Dark AgesThere is no conclusive evidence for the existence of a Mycenean palace on top of the Athenian Acropolis. However, if there was such a palace, it seems to have been supplanted by later building activity. Not much is known as to the architectural appearance of the Acropolis until the Archaic era. In the 7th and the 6th centuries BC, the site was taken over by Kylon during the failed Kylonian revolt, and twice by Peisistratos: all attempts directed at seizing political power by ''coup|coups d'état''. Peisistratos built an entry gate or Propylaea and perhaps embarked on the construction of an earlier temple on the site of the Parthenon where fragments of sculptured limestone have been found as well as the foundations of a large unfinished temple.["Peisistratos"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved 2 December 2012. Nevertheless, it seems that a nine-gate wall, the ''Enneapylon'',["Acropolis fortification wall"], Odysseus. Retrieved 2 December 2012. had been built around the biggest water spring, the "Clepsydra", at the northwestern foot.Archaic AcropolisA temple to ''Athena Polias'' (protectress of the city) was erected around 570–550 BC. This Doric limestone building, from which many relics survive, is referred to as the ''Hekatompedon'' (Greek for "hundred–footed"), ''Ur-Parthenon'' (German for "original Parthenon" or "primitive Parthenon"), ''H–Architecture'' or ''Bluebeard'' temple, after the pedimental three-bodied man-serpent sculpture, whose beards were painted dark blue. Whether this temple replaced an older one, or just a sacred precinct or altar, is not known. Probably, the ''Hekatompedon'' was built where the Parthenon now stands.Between 529–520 BC yet another temple was built by the Peisistratids, the Old Temple of Athena, usually referred to as the ''Arkhaios Neōs'' (ἀρχαῖος νεώς, "ancient temple"). This temple of Athena Polias was built upon the ''Doerpfeld'' foundations, between the Erechtheion and the still-standing Parthenon. ''Arkhaios Neōs'' was destroyed by the Persian invasion in 480 BC. However, the temple was probably reconstructed since in 454 BC the treasury of the Delian League was transferred in its opisthodomos. The temple may have been burnt down in 406/405 BC as Xenophon mentions that the old temple of Athena was set on fire. Pausanias does not mention it in his 2nd century AD ''Description of Greece''. , Retrieved 5 June 2012Around 500 BC the ''Ur-Parthenon'' was dismantled to make place for a newer and grander building, the "Older Parthenon" (often called ''Pre-Parthenon'', "early Parthenon"). Athenians decided to stop the construction of the Olympieion which was related with the tyrant Peisistratos and his sons and instead used the Piraeus limestone destined for the Olympieion to build the Older Parthenon. To accommodate it, the south part of the summit was cleared, made level by adding some 8,000 two-ton blocks of limestone, a foundation  deep at some points, and the rest filled with earth kept in place by the retaining wall. However, after the victorious Battle of Marathon in 490 BC, the plan was revised and marble was used instead. The limestone phase of the building is referred to as ''Pre-Parthenon I'', the marble phase as ''Pre-Parthenon II''. In 485 BC, construction stalled to save resources as Xerxes took the throne.Manolis Korres, [''Topographic Issues of the Acropolis''], Archaeology of the City of Athens; Retrieved 7 June 2012The Older Parthenon was still under construction when the Persians sacked the city in 480 BC.

After the Persian crisis had subsided, the Athenians incorporated many of the unfinished temple's architectural members (unfluted column drums, triglyphs, metopes, etc.) into the newly built northern curtain wall of the Acropolis, where they serve as a prominent "war memorial" and can still be seen today. The devastated site was cleared of debris. Statuary, cult objects, religious offerings and unsalvageable architectural members were buried ceremoniously in several deeply dug pits on the hill, serving conveniently as a fill for the artificial plateau created around the classic Parthenon. This "Persian debris" is the richest archaeological deposit excavated on the Acropolis and is well known throughout Greece.Kavvadias, Panagiotis, Kawerau, Georg: ''Die Ausgrabung der Akropolis vom Jahre 1885 bis zum Jahre 1890'', Athens, 1906The Periclean building programFile:The Parthenon in Athens.jpg|thumb|left|The ParthenonAfter winning at Eurymedon in 468 BC, Cimon and Themistocles ordered the reconstruction of the  southern and northern walls of the Acropolis. Most of the major temples, including the Parthenon, were rebuilt under the leadership of Pericles during the Golden Age of Athens (460–430 BC). Phidias, a great Athenian sculptor, and Ictinus and Callicrates, two famous architects, were responsible for the reconstruction.["Ictinus and Callicrates with Phidias"], ''Architecture Week''.

These colonnades were almost finished in 432 BC and had two wings, the northern one decorated with paintings by Polygnotus. Around the same time, south of the Propylaea, building started on the small Ionic Temple of Athena Nike in Pentelic marble with tetrastyle porches, preserving the essentials of Greek temple design. After an interruption caused by the Peloponnesian War, the temple was finished in the time of Nicias' peace, between 421 BC and 409 BC.The PropylaeaConstruction of the elegant temple of Erechtheion in Pentelic marble (421–406 BC) was in accordance with a complex plan which took account of the extremely uneven ground and the need to circumvent several shrines in the area. The entrance, facing east, is lined with six Ionic columns. Unusually, the temple has two porches, one on the northwest corner borne by Ionic columns, the other, to the southwest, supported by huge female figures or Caryatids. The eastern part of the temple was dedicated to Athena Polias, while the western part, serving the cult of the archaic king Poseidon-Erechtheus, housed the altars of Hephaestus and Voutos, brother of Erechtheus.

During the festival, a procession (believed to be depicted on the Parthenon frieze) traveled through the city via the Panathenaic Way and culminated on the Acropolis.  There, a new robe of woven wool (''peplos'') was placed on either the statue of Athena Polias in the Erechtheum (during a regular Panathenaea) or on the statue of Athena Parthenos in the Parthenon (during the Great Panathenaea, held every four years).Within the later tradition of Western Civilization and classical revival the Acropolis, from at least the mid-18th century on, has often been invoked as a key symbol of the Greek legacy and of the glories of Classical Greece.ReferencesBibliography*************File:Acropolis in Athen, Greece.jpg|thumb|[Pillars of the Acropolis in Athens, Greece.]External linksAcropolis of Athens*[The Acropolis of Athens] (Greek Government website)*[The Acropolis Restoration Project] (Greek Government website)***[The Glafka Project]*[UNESCO World Heritage Centre — Acropolis, Athens]*[Ancient Athens 3D]**[The Acropolis of Athens-Athensguide]*[Tour of Acropolis of Athens, Site of the Parthenon-About.com]*[Athenian Acropolis];Videos*
