Athens (disambiguation)'''Athens''' (; , ''Athína'' , ), is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning around 3,400 years, and the earliest human presence started somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennium BC.;; Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy,[BBC History on Greek Democracy] – Accessed on 26 January 2007 largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent and in particular the Romans.[Ancient Greece] from the Internet Archive– Retrieved on 28 February 2012. [Archived] 31 October 2009. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.Athens is recognised as a global city because of its geo-strategic location and its importance in shipping, finance, commerce, media, entertainment, arts, international trade, culture, education and tourism. It is one of the biggest economic centres in southeastern Europe, with a large financial sector, and its port Piraeus is the largest passenger port in Europe, and the second largest in the world. The municipality (City) of Athens had a population of 664,046 (in 2011,census11796,442 in 2004) within its administrative limits, and a land area of . The urban area of Athens (Greater Athens and Greater Piraeus) extends beyond its administrative municipal city limits, with a population of 3,090,508 (in 2011) over an area of .areaAccording to Eurostat in 2004, the Athens Larger Urban Zone (LUZ) was the 7th most populous LUZ in the European Union (the 5th most populous capital city of the EU), with a population of 4,013,368. Athens is also the southernmost capital on the European mainland.The heritage of the classical era is still evident in the city, represented by ancient monuments and works of art, the most famous of all being the Parthenon, considered a key landmark of early Western civilization. The city also retains Roman and Byzantine monuments, as well as a smaller number of Ottoman monuments.Athens is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Acropolis of Athens and the medieval Daphni Monastery. Landmarks of the modern era, dating back to the establishment of Athens as the capital of the independent Greek state in 1834, include the Hellenic Parliament (19th century) and the Athens Trilogy, consisting of the National Library of Greece, the Athens University and the Academy of Athens. Athens was the host city of the first modern-day Olympic Games in 1896, and 108 years later it welcomed home the 2004 Summer Olympics. Athens is home to the National Archeological Museum, featuring the world's largest collection of ancient Greek antiquities, as well as the new Acropolis Museum.EtymologyNames of European cities in different languages: AFile:Athena Varvakeion - MANA - Fidias.jpg|thumb|upright|Athena, patron goddess of Athens; National Archaeological MuseumIn Ancient Greek, Athens' name was  (''Athēnai'',  in Classical Attic) a plural. In earlier Greek, such as Homeric Greek, the name was in the singular form, as  (''Athēnē'')As for example in  and was then rendered in the plural, like those of  (''Thebes, Greece|Thēbai'') and  (''Mycenae|Μukēnai''). The root of the word is probably not of Greek or Indo-European origin, and is a possible remnant of the Pre-Greek substrate of Attica,R. S. P. Beekes, ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 29 (''s.v.'' "Ἀθήνη"). as with the name of the goddess Athena (Attic  ''Athēnā'', Ionic  ''Athēnē'' and Doric  ''Athānā''), who was always related to the city of Athens. During the medieval period the name of the city was rendered once again in the singular as . However, because of the conservatism of the written language,   remained the official name of the city until the abandonment of Katharevousa in the 1970s, when Ἀθήνα became the official name.Previously, there had been other etymologies by scholars of the 19th century. Lobeck proposed as the root of the name the word  (''athos'') or  (''anthos'') meaning flower, to denote Athens as the ''flowering'' city. On the other hand, Johann Christoph Wilhelm Ludwig Döderlein|Döderlein proposed the stem of the verb , stem θη- (''thaō'', stem ''thē-'', "to suck") to denote Athens as having fertile soil.''Great Greek Encyclopedia'', vol. II, page 30, Athens, 1927An etiological myth explaining how Athens has acquired this name was well known among ancient Athenians and even became the theme of the sculpture on the West pediment of the Parthenon. The goddess of wisdom, Athena and the god of the seas, Poseidon had many disagreements and battles between them, and one of these was a race to be the Patron God of the city. In an attempt to compel the people, Poseidon created a salt water spring by striking the ground with his trident, symbolizing naval power. However, when Athena created the olive tree, symbolizing peace and prosperity, the Athenians, under their ruler Cecrops, accepted the olive tree and named the city after Athena.The city is sometimes referred in Greek as "", which means in English ''the glorious city'', or simply as "" (''protevousa''), 'the capital'.HistoryHistory of AthensTimeline of AthensFile:View of the Acropolis Athens (pixinn.net).jpg|right|thumb|Acropolis of Athens, with Odeon of Herodes Atticus seen on bottom leftThe oldest known human presence in Athens is the Cave of Schist, which has been dated to between the 11th and 7th centuries BC. Athens has been continuously inhabited for at least 7000 years.tungBy 1400BC the settlement had become an important centre of the Mycenaean civilization and the Acropolis was the site of a major Mycenaean fortress, whose remains can be recognised from sections of the characteristic Cyclopean walls.Iakovides, S. 1962. 'E mykenaïke akropolis ton Athenon'. Athens. Unlike other Mycenaean centers, such as Mycenae and Pylos, it is not known whether Athens suffered destruction in about 1200BC, an event often attributed to a Dorian invasion, and the Athenians always maintained that they were "pure" Ionians with no Dorian element. However, Athens, like many other Bronze Age settlements, went into economic decline for around 150 years afterwards.|left|upright|Statue of Theseus. Theseus was responsible, according to the myth, for the ''synoikismos'' ("dwelling together")—the political unification of Attica under Athens.Iron Age burials, in the Kerameikos and other locations, are often richly provided for and demonstrate that from 900BC onwards Athens was one of the leading centres of trade and prosperity in the region.Osborne, R. 1996, 2009. ''Greece in the Making 1200 – 479BC''. The leading position of Athens may well have resulted from its central location in the Greek world, its secure stronghold on the Acropolis and its access to the sea, which gave it a natural advantage over inland rivals such as Thebes and Sparta.File:Map athenian empire 431 BC-en.svg|thumb|Delian League, under the leadership of Athens before the Peloponnesian War in 431BCFile:Monument de Philopappos crop.jpg|thumb|The Roman-era Philopappos MonumentBy the 6th century BC, widespread social unrest led to the reforms of Solon. These would pave the way for the eventual introduction of democracy by Cleisthenes in 508BC. Athens had by this time become a significant naval power with a large fleet, and helped the rebellion of the Ionian cities against Persian rule. In the ensuing Greco-Persian Wars Athens, together with Sparta, led the coalition of Greek states that would eventually repel the Persians, defeating them decisively at Marathon in 490BC, and crucially at Salamis in 480BC. However, this did not prevent Athens from being captured and sacked twice by the Persians within one year, after a heroic resistance at Thermopylae by Spartans and other Greeks led by King Leonidas, after both Boeotia and Attica fell to the Persians.The decades that followed became known as the Golden Age of Athenian democracy, during which time Athens became the leading city of Ancient Greece, with its cultural achievements laying the foundations of Western civilization. The playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides flourished in Athens during this time, as did the historians Herodotus and Thucydides, the physician Hippocrates, and the philosopher Socrates. Guided by Pericles, who promoted the arts and fostered democracy, Athens embarked on an ambitious building program that saw the construction of the Acropolis of Athens (including the Parthenon), as well as empire-building via the Delian League. Originally intended as an association of Greek city-states to continue the fight against the Persians, the league soon turned into a vehicle for Athens's own imperial ambitions. The resulting tensions brought about the Peloponnesian War (431–404BC), in which Athens was defeated by its rival Sparta.By the mid-4th century BC, the northern Greek kingdom of Macedon was becoming dominant in Athenian affairs. In 338BC the armies of Philip II defeated an alliance of some of the Greek city-states including Athens and Thebes at the Battle of Chaeronea, effectively ending Athenian independence. Later, under Rome, Athens was given the status of a free city because of its widely admired schools. The Roman emperor Hadrian, in the 2nd century AD, constructed a library, a gymnasium, an aqueduct which is still in use, several temples and sanctuaries, a bridge and financed the completion of the Temple of Olympian Zeus.By the end of Late Antiquity, the city experienced decline followed by recovery in the second half of the Middle Byzantine Period, in the 9th to 10th centuries AD, and was relatively prosperous during the Crusades, benefiting from Italian trade. After the Fourth Crusade the Duchy of Athens was established. In 1458 it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire and entered a long period of decline.File:Otto's entry in Athens.jpg|thumb|''The Entry of King Otto in Athens'', Peter von Hess, 1839.Following the Greek War of Independence and the establishment of the Greek Kingdom, Athens was chosen as the capital of the newly independent Greek state in 1834, largely because of historical and sentimental reasons. At the time it was a town of modest size built around the foot of the Acropolis. The first King of Greece, Otto of Bavaria, commissioned the architects Stamatios Kleanthis and Eduard Schaubert to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state.The first modern city plan consisted of a triangle defined by the Acropolis, the ancient cemetery of Kerameikos and the new palace of the Bavarian king (now housing the Greek Parliament), so as to highlight the continuity between modern and ancient Athens. Neoclassicism, the international style of this epoch, was the architectural style through which Bavarian, French and Greek architects such as Hansen, Klenze, Boulanger or Kaftantzoglou designed the first important public buildings of the new capital. In 1896 Athens hosted the first modern Olympic Games. During the 1920s a number of Greek refugees, expelled from Asia Minor after the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), swelled Athens's population; nevertheless it was most particularly following World War II, and from the 1950s and 1960s, that the population of the city exploded, and Athens experienced a gradual expansion.In the 1980s it became evident that smog from factories and an ever increasing fleet of automobiles, as well as a lack of adequate free space due to congestion, had evolved into the city's most important challenge. A series of anti-pollution measures taken by the city's authorities in the 1990s, combined with a substantial improvement of the city's infrastructure (including the Attiki Odos motorway, the expansion of the Athens Metro, and the new Athens International Airport), considerably alleviated pollution and transformed Athens into a much more functional city. In 2004 Athens hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics. It also hosted the Miss Universe 1973 pageant.GeographyGeologyFile:Πανοραμική Νέας Πεντέλης.jpg|thumb|View of Mount Penteli, the second tallest mountain surrounding Athens.File:Athens - Mount Lycabettus - 20080729a.jpg|thumb|Mount Lycabettus.Athens sprawls across the central plain of Attica that is often referred to as the ''Athens or Attica Basin'' (Greek: Λεκανοπέδιο Αττικής). The basin is bounded by four large mountains: Mount Aegaleo to the west, Mount Parnitha to the north, Mount Penteli to the northeast and Mount Hymettus to the east. Beyond Mount Aegaleo lies the Thriasian plain, which forms an extension of the central plain to the west. The Saronic Gulf lies to the southwest. Mount Parnitha is the tallest of the four mountains (), and has been declared a national park.Athens is built around a number of hills. Lycabettus is one of the tallest hills of the city proper and provides a view of the entire Attica Basin. The geomorphology of Athens is deemed to be one of the most complex in the world because its mountains cause a temperature inversion phenomenon which, along with the Greek Government's difficulties controlling industrial pollution, was responsible for the air pollution problems the city has faced.tungThis issue is not unique to Athens; for instance, Los Angeles and Mexico City also suffer from similar geomorphology inversion problems.The Cephissus river,the Ilisos and the Eridanos stream are the historical rivers of Athens.ClimateAthens has a subtropical Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification|Köppen ''Csa'') and receives just enough annual precipitation to avoid Köppen's ''BSh'' (semi-arid climate) classification. The dominant feature of Athens's climate is alternation between prolonged hot and dry summers and mild winters with moderate rainfall.Founda D. (2011). "Evolution of the air temperature in Athens and evidence of climatic change: A review". Advances in Building Energy Research, 5,1, 7–41, With an average of in of yearly precipitation, rainfall occurs largely between the months of October and April. July and August are the driest months, where thunderstorms occur sparsely once or twice a month. Winters are mild and rainy, with a January average of 1; in Nea Filadelfeia and 1 in Hellinikon; Snowstorms are infrequent but can cause disruption when they occur. Snowfalls are more frequent in the northern suburbs of the city.The annual precipitation of Athens is typically lower than in other parts of Greece, mainly in western Greece. As an example, Ioannina receives around  per year, and Agrinio around  per year. Daily average highs for July (1955–2004) have been measured at 1 at Nea Filadelfeia weather station, but other parts of the city may be even warmer, in particular its western areas partly because of industrialization and partly because of a number of natural factors, knowledge of which has been available from the mid-19th century.Κωνσταντίνος Μαυρογιάννης, Αθήναι (1981).''Παρατηρήσεις επί του κλίματος των Αθηνών και της ενεργείας αυτού επί της ζωϊκής οικονομίας'' σελ 29.Giannopoulou K., Livada I., Santamouris M., Saliari M., Assimakopoulos M., Caouris Y.G.

They are often to be found in the same areas, as Athens is not marked by a uniformity of architectural style.For the greatest part of the 19th century Neoclassicism dominated Athens, as well as some deviations from it such as Eclecticism, especially in the early 20th century. Thus, the Hellenic Parliament was the first important public building to be built, between 1836 and 1843. Later in the mid and late 19th century, Theophil Freiherr von Hansen and Ernst Ziller took part in the construction of many neoclassical buildings such as the Athens Academy and the Zappeion Hall. Ziller also designed many private mansions in the centre of Athens which gradually became public, usually through donations, such as Schliemann's Iliou Melathron.Beginning in the 1920s, Modern architecture including Bauhaus and Art Deco began to exert an influence on almost all Greek architects, and buildings both public and private were constructed in accordance with these styles. Localities with a great number of such buildings include Kolonaki, and some areas of the centre of the city; neighbourhoods developed in this period include Kypseli.Fessas-Emmanouil, Helen.

XXI, ISBN 960-6691-38-1In the 1950s and 1960s during the extension and development of Athens, other modern movements such as the International style played an important role. The centre of Athens was largely rebuilt, leading to the demolition of a number of neoclassical buildings. The architects of this era employed materials such as glass, marble and aluminium, and many blended modern and classical elements.Fessas-Emmanouil, Helen.

It is surrounded by hotels and fast food outlets, and contains a train station used by the Athens Metro and the Ilektrikos, named Omonoia Station. The square is the focus for celebration of sporting victories, as seen after the country's winning of the Euro 2004 and the Eurobasket 2005 tournaments.* '''Metaxourgeio''' () is a neighborhood of Athens. The neighborhood is located north of the historical centre of Athens, between Kolonos to the east and Kerameikos to the west, and north of Gazi. Metaxourgeio is frequently described as a transition neighborhood. After a long period of abandonment in the late 20th century, the area is acquiring a reputation as an artistic and fashionable neighborhood following the opening of art galleries, museums, restaurants and cafes. [1] Local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighborhood have reinforced a sense of community and artistic expression. Anonymous art pieces containing quotes and statements in both English and Ancient Greek have sprung up throughout the neighborhood, bearing statements such as "Art for art's sake" (Τέχνη τέχνης χάριν). Guerilla gardening has also helped to beautify the area.* '''Psiri and Gazi''' – The reviving Psiri () neighbourhood – also known as Athens's "meat packing district" – is dotted with renovated former mansions, artists' spaces, and small gallery areas. A number of its renovated buildings also host fashionable bars, making it a hotspot for the city in the last decade, while live music restaurants known as "rebetadika", after rebetiko, a unique form of music that blossomed in Syros and Athens from the 1920s until the 1960s, are to be found. Rebetiko is admired by many, and as a result rebetadika are often crammed with people of all ages who will sing, dance and drink till dawn.The Gazi () area, one of the latest in full redevelopment, is located around a historic gas factory, now converted into the ''Technopolis'' cultural multiplex, and also includes artists' areas, small clubs, bars and restaurants, as well as Athens's "Gay Village". The metro's expansion to the western suburbs of the city has brought easier access to the area since spring 2007, as the blue line now stops at Gazi (Kerameikos station).* '''Syntagma''', Syntagma Square, (/Constitution Square), is the capital's central and largest square, lying adjacent to the Greek Parliament (the former Royal Palace) and the city's most notable hotels. Ermou Street, an approximately one kilometer () long pedestrian road connecting Syntagma Square to Monastiraki, is a consumer paradise for both Athenians and tourists. Complete with fashion shops and shopping centres promoting most international brands, it now finds itself in the top five most expensive shopping streets in Europe, and the tenth most expensive retail street in the world. Nearby, the renovated Army Fund building in Panepistimiou Street includes the "Attica" department store and several upmarket designer stores.* '''Plaka, Monastiraki, and Thission''' – Plaka (), lying just beneath the Acropolis, is famous for its plentiful neoclassical architecture, making up one of the most scenic districts of the city. It remains a prime tourist destination with tavernas, live performances and street salesmen. Nearby Monastiraki (), for its part, is known for its string of small shops and markets, as well as its crowded flea market and tavernas specialising in souvlaki. Another district known for its student-crammed, stylish cafés is Theseum or Thission (), lying just west of Monastiraki. Thission is home to the ancient Temple of Hephaestus, standing atop a small hill. This area also has a picturesque 11th-century Byzantine church, as well as a 15th-century Ottoman mosque.* '''Exarcheia''' (), located north of Kolonaki, is the location of the city's anarchist scene and as a student quarter with cafés, bars and bookshops. Exarcheia is home to the Athens Polytechnic and the National Archaeological Museum; it also contains important buildings of several 20th-century styles: Neoclassicism, Art Deco and Early Modernism (including Bauhaus influences).* '''Kolonaki''' () is the area at the base of Lycabettus hill, full of boutiques catering to well-heeled customers by day, and bars and more fashionable restaurants by night, with galleries and museums. This is often regarded as one of the more prestigious areas of the capital.Urban and suburban municipalitiesFile:Συγκροτήματα Μεζονετών Βριλησσίων.jpg|thumb|right|Ano Vrilissia Maisonette BlockThe Athens Metropolitan Area consists of 58"statistics1"densely populated municipalities, sprawling around the municipality of Athens (the city centre) in virtually all directions.

According to their geographic location in relation to the City of Athens, the suburbs are divided into four zones; the northern suburbs (including Agios Stefanos, Dionysos, Ekali, Nea Erythraia, Kifissia, Maroussi, Pefki, Lykovrysi, Metamorfosi, Nea Ionia, Nea Filadelfeia, Irakleio, Vrilissia, Melissia, Penteli, Chalandri, Agia Paraskevi, Galatsi, Psychiko and Filothei); the southern suburbs (including Alimos, Nea Smyrni, Moschato, Kallithea, Agios Dimitrios, Palaio Faliro, Elliniko, Glyfada, Argyroupoli, Ilioupoli, Voula and Vouliagmeni); the eastern suburbs (including Zografou, Dafni, Vyronas, Kaisariani, Cholargos and Papagou); and the western suburbs (including Peristeri, Ilion, Egaleo, Agia Varvara, Chaidari, Petroupoli, Agioi Anargyroi and Kamatero).The Athens city coastline, extending from the major commercial port of Piraeus to the southernmost suburb of Varkiza for some , is also connected to the city centre by a tram.Beach in Vouliagmeni, one of dozens of beaches in the South coast of AthensIn the northern suburb of Maroussi, the upgraded main Olympic Complex (known by its Greek acronym OAKA) dominates the skyline. The area has been redeveloped according to a design by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, with steel arches, landscaped gardens, fountains, futuristic glass, and a landmark new blue glass roof which was added to the main stadium. A second Olympic complex, next to the sea at the beach of Palaio Faliro, also features modern stadia, shops and an elevated esplanade. Work is underway to transform the grounds of the old Athens Airport – named Elliniko – in the southern suburbs, into one of the largest landscaped parks in Europe, to be named the Hellenikon Metropolitan Park.Many of the southern suburbs (such as Alimos, Palaio Faliro, Elliniko, Voula, Vouliagmeni and Varkiza) host a number of sandy beaches, most of which are operated by the Greek National Tourism Organisation and require an entrance fee. Casinos operate on both Mount Parnitha, some  from downtown Athens (accessible by car or cable car), and the nearby town of Loutraki (accessible by car via the Athens – Corinth National Highway, or the suburban rail service Proastiakos).Parks and zoosThe entrance of the National Gardens, commissioned by Queen Amalia in 1838 and completed by 1840Parnitha National Park is punctuated by well-marked paths, gorges, springs, torrents and caves dotting the protected area. Hiking and mountain-biking in all four mountains are popular outdoor activities for residents of the city. The National Garden of Athens was completed in 1840 and is a green refuge of 15.5 hectares in the centre of the Greek capital. It is to be found between the Parliament and Zappeion buildings, the latter of which maintains its own garden of seven hectares.Parts of the city centre have been redeveloped under a masterplan called the ''Unification of Archeological Sites of Athens'', which has also gathered funding from the EU to help enhance the project.EUfundThe landmark Dionysiou Areopagitou Street has been pedestrianised, forming a scenic route. The route starts from the Temple of Olympian Zeus at Vasilissis Olgas Avenue, continues under the southern slopes of the Acropolis near Plaka, and finishes just beyond the Temple of Hephaestus in Thiseio. The route in its entirety provides visitors with views of the Parthenon and the Agora (the meeting point of ancient Athenians), away from the busy city centre.The hills of Athens also provide green space. Lycabettus, Philopappos hill and the area around it, including Pnyx and Ardettos hill, are planted with pines and other trees, with the character of a small forest rather than typical metropolitan parkland. Also to be found is the Pedion tou Areos (''Field of Mars'') of 27.7 hectares, near the National Archaeological Museum.Athens' largest zoo is the Attica Zoological Park, a 20-hectare (49-acre) private zoo located in the suburb of Spata. The zoo is home to around 2000 animals representing 400 species, and is open 365 days a year. Smaller zoos exist within public gardens or parks, such as the zoo within the National Garden of Athens.EconomyErmou street near Syntagma Square.

During the Greek Dark Ages the population of Athens was around 4,000 people. In 700BC the population grew to 10,000. In 500BC the area probably contained 200,000 people. During the classical period the city's population is estimated from 150,000 – 350,000 and up to 610,000 according to Thucydides. When Demetrius of Phalerum conducted a population census in 317BC the population was 21,000 free citizens, plus 10,000 resident aliens and 400,000 slaves. This suggests a total population of 431,000.The municipality of Athens has an official population of 664,046 people.census11The four regional units that make up what is referred to as Greater Athens have a combined population of 2,640,701. They together with the regional unit of Piraeus (Greater Piraeus) make up the dense Athens Urban Area which reaches a total population of 3,090,508 inhabitants (in 2011)."statistics1"The ancient site of Athens is centred on the rocky hill of the acropolis. In ancient times the port of Piraeus was a separate city, but it has now been absorbed into the Athens Urban Area. The rapid expansion of the city, which continues to this day, was initiated in the 1950s and 1960s, because of Greece's transition from an agricultural to an industrial nation.[Greek Tourist Organizer] – Retrieved on 6 January 2007 The expansion is now particularly toward the East and North East (a tendency greatly related to the new Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport and the Attiki Odos, the freeway that cuts across Attica). By this process Athens has engulfed many former suburbs and villages in Attica, and continues to do so.

Piraeus also forms a significant city centre on its own, within the Athens Urban Area and being the second largest in population size within it, with Peristeri and Kallithea following.The '''Athens Urban Area''' today consists of 40 municipalities, 35 of which make up what is referred to as the Greater Athens municipalities, located within 4 regional units (North Athens, West Athens, Central Athens, South Athens); and a further 5, which make up the Greater Piraeus municipalities, located within the regional unit of Piraeus as mentioned above. The densely built up urban area of the Greek capital sprawls acrossareathroughout the ''Attica Basin'' and has a total population of 3,074,160 (in 2011).The '''Athens Metropolitan Area''' spans  within the Attica region and includes a total of 58 municipalities, which are organized in 7 regional units (those outlined above, along with East Attica and West Attica), having reached a population of 3,737,550 based on the preliminary results of the 2011 census. Athens and Piraeus municipalities serve as the two metropolitan centres of the Athens Metropolitan Area. There are also some inter-municipal centres serving specific areas. For example, Kifissia and Glyfada serve as inter-municipal centres for northern and southern suburbs respectively.Culture and contemporary lifeCulture of GreeceFile:Athènes Acropole Caryatides.JPG|thumb|The porch of the Caryatids at the ErechtheumFile:Attica 06-13 Athens 22 View from Acropolis Hill - Museum of Ancient Agora.jpg|thumb|The Byzantine Church of the Holy Apostles next to the Stoa of AttalosFile:Hephaistos Temple.JPG|thumb|The Temple of Hephaestus is the best-preserved of all ancient Greek temples.File:Odeon of Herodes Atticus 2012.jpg|thumb|View of the Odeon of Herodes Atticus in 2012.

The biggest stadium in the country, it hosted two finals of the UEFA Champions League, in 1994 and 2007. Athens' other major stadium, located in the Piraeus area, is the Karaiskakis Stadium, a sports and entertainment complex, host of the 1971 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final.

Despite the fact that the Athenian songs were not autonomous artistic creations (in contrast with the serenades) and despite their original connection with mainly dramatic forms of Art, they eventually became hits as independent songs. Notable actors of Greek operettas, who made also a series of melodies and songs popular at that time, include Orestis Makris, Kalouta sisters, Vasilis Avlonitis, Afroditi Laoutari, Eleni Papadaki, Marika Nezer, Marika Krevata and others. After 1930, wavering among American and European musical influences as well as the Greek musical tradition. Greek composers begin to write music using the tunes of the tango, waltz, swing, foxtrot, some times combined with melodies in the style of Athenian serenades' repertory. Nikos Gounaris was probably the most renowned composer and singer of the time.In 1923, after the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, many ethnic Greeks from Asia Minor fled to Athens as a result of the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War. They settled in poor neighborhoods and brought with them Rebetiko music, making it popular also in Greece, which became later the base for the Laïko music. Other forms of song popular today in Greece are elafrolaika, entechno, dimotika, and skyladika. Greece's most notable, and internationally famous, composers of Greek song, mainly of the entechno form, are Manos Hadjidakis and Mikis Theodorakis. Both composers have achieved fame in the west for their composition of film scores."Tales of Orpheus"EducationFile:Attica 06-13 Athens 28 Academy of Athens.jpg|thumb|upright|Building of the Academy of Athens (modern)The ''Propylaea'', part of the "Trilogy" of Theofil Hansen, serves as the ceremony hall and rectory of the National and Kapodistrian University of AthensLocated on Panepistimiou Street, the old campus of the University of Athens, the National Library, and the Athens Academy form the "Athens Trilogy" built in the mid-19th century.

The second higher education institution in the city is the Athens Polytechnic School, found in Patission Street. This was the location where on 17 November 1973, more than 13 students were killed and hundreds injured inside the university during the Athens Polytechnic uprising, against the Greek military junta of 1967–1974|military junta that ruled the nation from 21 April 1967 until 23 July 1974.Other universities that lie within Athens are the Athens University of Economics and Business, the Panteion University, the Agricultural University of Athens and the University of Piraeus.

A series of measures taken by the authorities of the city throughout the 1990s resulted in the improvement of air quality; the appearance of smog (or ''nefos'' as the Athenians used to call it) has become less common.Measures taken by the Greek authorities throughout the 1990s have improved the quality of air over the Attica Basin. Nevertheless, air pollution still remains an issue for Athens, particularly during the hottest summer days. In late June 2007, the Attica region experienced a number of brush fires,outragedincluding a blaze that burned a significant portion of a large forested national park in Mount Parnitha, considered critical to maintaining a better air quality in Athens all year round.outragedDamage to the park has led to worries over a stalling in the improvement of air quality in the city.outragedThe major waste management efforts undertaken in the last decade (particularly the plant built on the small island of Psytalia) have improved water quality in the Saronic Gulf, and the coastal waters of Athens are now accessible again to swimmers. In January 2007, Athens faced a waste management problem when its landfill near Ano Liosia, an Athenian suburb, reached capacity. The crisis eased by mid-January when authorities began taking the garbage to a temporary landfill.overflowTransportPublic transport in AthensFile:Athens Metro Map (December 2013, English).svg|thumb|left|Athens metropolitan railway network (metró and proastiakós), as of January 2014File:Athens Metro Agios Dimitrios station.jpg|thumb|Agios Dimitrios station with an island platformAthens is serviced by a variety of transportation means, forming the largest mass transit system of Greece.

Because of financial difficulties, all international rail services were suspended indefinitely in 2011. The Port of Piraeus connects Athens to the numerous Greek islands of the Aegean Sea, with ferries departing, while also serving the cruise ships that arrive.MotorwaysHighways in Greeceright|Interchange at the Attiki Odos airport entranceView of Hymettus tangent (Periferiaki Imittou) from Kalogeros HillTwo main motorways of Greece begin in Athens, namely the A1/E75, which crosses through Athens's Urban Area from Piraeus, heading north towards Greece's second largest city, Thessaloniki; and the A8/E94 heading west, towards Patras, which incorporated the GR-8A. Before their completion much of the road traffic used the GR-1 and the GR-8.Athens' Metropolitan Area is served by the motorway network of the Attiki Odos toll-motorway (code: A6). Its main section extends from the western industrial suburb of Elefsina to Athens International Airport; while two beltways, namely the Aigaleo Beltway (A65) and the Hymettus Beltway (A64) serve parts of western and eastern Athens respectively. The span of the Attiki Odos in all its length is ,  making it the largest metropolitan motorway network in all of Greece.* Motorways:** '''A1/E75 N''' ''(Lamia, Larissa, Thessaloniki)''** '''A8 (GR-8A)/E94 W''' ''(Elefsina, Corinth, Patras)''** '''A6 W''' ''(Elefsina)'' '''E''' ''(Airport)''* National roads:** '''GR-1 Ν''' ''(Lamia, Larissa, Thessaloniki)''** '''GR-8 W''' ''(Corinth, Patras)''** '''GR-3 N''' ''(Elefsina, Lamia, Larissa)''Olympic Games1896 Summer Olympics1896 Summer OlympicsFile:Louis entering Kallimarmaron at the 1896 Athens Olympics.jpg|thumb|Spyridon Louis entering the Kallimarmaron Stadium at the end of the marathonCentral Athens, c. 1900, showing Zappeion, Kallimarmaron and their environs1896 brought forth the revival of the modern Olympic Games, by Frenchman Pierre de Coubertin. Thanks to his efforts, Athens was awarded the first modern Olympic Games. In 1896, the city had a population of 123,000tung2and the event helped boost the city's international profile. Of the venues used for these Olympics, the Kallimarmaro Stadium, and Zappeion were most crucial. The Kallimarmaro is a replica of the ancient Athenian stadiums, and the only major stadium (in its capacity of 60,000) to be made entirely of white marble from Mount Penteli, the same material used for construction of the Parthenon.1906 Summer Olympics1906 Intercalated GamesThe 1906 Summer Olympics, or the 1906 Intercalated games, were held in Athens. The intercalated competitions were intermediate games to the internationally organized Olympics, and were meant to be organized in Greece every four years, between the main Olympics. This idea later lost support from the IOC and these games were discontinued.2004 Summer Olympics2004 Summer Olympics10,000-meter final during the 2004 Olympic GamesAthens was awarded the 2004 Summer Olympics on 5 September 1997 in Lausanne, Switzerland, after having lost a previous bid to host the 1996 Summer Olympics, to Atlanta, United States.olyIt was to be the second time Athens would host the games, following the inaugural event of 1896. After an unsuccessful bid in 1990, the 1997 bid was radically improved, including an appeal to Greece's Olympic history. In the last round of voting, Athens defeated Rome with 66 votes to 41.olyPrior to this round, the cities of Buenos Aires, Stockholm and Cape Town had been eliminated from competition, having received fewer votes.olyDuring the first three years of preparations, the International Olympic Committee had expressed concern over the speed of construction progress for some of the new Olympic venues. In 2000 the Organising Committee's president was replaced by Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, who was the president of the original Bidding Committee in 1997. From that point forward, preparations continued at a highly accelerated, almost frenzied pace.Although the heavy cost was criticized, estimated at $1.5billion, Athens was transformed into a more functional city that enjoys modern technology both in transportation and in modern urban development. Some of the finest sporting venues in the world were created in the city, all of which were fully ready for the games. The games welcomed over 10,000 athletes from all 202 countries.olyyThe 2004 Games were judged a success, as both security and organization worked well, and only a few visitors reported minor problems mainly concerning accommodation issues. The 2004 Olympic Games were described as ''Unforgettable, dream Games'', by IOC President Jacques Rogge for their return to the birthplace of the Olympics, and for meeting the challenges of holding the Olympic Games.olyyThe only observable problem was a somewhat sparse attendance of some early events. Eventually, however, a total of more than 3.5million tickets were sold, which was higher than any other Olympics with the exception of Sydney (more than 5million tickets were sold there in 2000).In 2008 it was reported that most of the Olympic venues had fallen into disrepair: according to those reports, 21 of the 22 facilities built for the games had either been left abandoned or are in a state of dereliction, with several squatter camps having sprung up around certain facilities, and a number of venues afflicted by vandalism, graffiti or strewn with rubbish. These claims, however, are disputed and likely to be inaccurate, as most of the facilities used for the Athens Olympics are either in use or in the process of being converted for post-Olympics use. The Greek Government has created a corporation, Olympic Properties SA, which is overseeing the post-Olympics management, development and conversion of these facilities, some of which will be sold off (or have already been sold off) to the private sector, while other facilities are still in use just as during the Olympics, or have been converted for commercial use or modified for other sports. Concerts and theatrical shows like those of the troupe Cirque du Soleil have recently been held in the complex."Tales of Orpheus"Special OlympicsThe 2011 Special Olympics World Summer Games was held from June, 25th 2011 – July, 4th 2011 in Athens, Greece. The opening ceremony of the games took place on 25 June 2011 at the Panathinaiko Stadium and the closing ceremony was held on 4 July 2011.Over 7,500 athletes, from 185 countries, competed in a total of 22 sports.International relationsList of twin towns and sister cities in GreeceTwin towns – sister citiesAthens is twinned with:3*ESP Barcelona, Spain (1999)*PRC Beijing, China (2005)"Greek twinnings"*PLE Bethlehem, Palestinian Territories (1986)"Greek twinnings"*USA Los Angeles, United States (1984)"Greek twinnings"*CYP Nicosia, Cyprus (1988)"Greek twinnings"*CYP Ammochostos, Cyprus (2005)"Greek twinnings"Other partnerships*SRB Belgrade, Serbia (1966)*FRA Paris, France (2000)*COL Santiago de Cali, Colombia*SVN Ljubljana, Slovenia*ITA Naples, ItalyOther locations named after Athens; USA United States:{| ;;|-| valign=top |* Athens, Alabama (pop. 24,234)* Athens, Arkansas* Athens, California* West Athens, California (pop. 9,101)* Athens, Georgia (pop. 114,983)* Athens, Illinois (pop. 1,726)* New Athens, Illinois (pop. 2,620)* New Athens Township, St. Clair County, Illinois (pop. 2,620)* Athens, Indiana* Athens, Kentucky* Athens, Louisiana (pop. 262)* Athens Township, Jewell County, Kansas (pop. 74)* Athens, Maine (pop. 847)* Athens, Michigan (pop. 1,111)* Athens Township, Michigan (pop. 2,571)* Athens, Minnesota* Athens Township, Minnesota (pop. 2,322)| valign=top |* Athens, Mississippi* Athens (town), New York (pop. 3,991)* Athens (village), New York (pop. 1,695)* Athens, Ohio (pop. 21,909)* Athens County, Ohio (pop. 62,223)* Athens Township, Athens County, Ohio (pop. 27,714)* Athens Township, Harrison County, Ohio (pop. 520)* New Athens, Ohio (pop. 342)* Athena, Oregon (pop. 1,270)* Athens, Pennsylvania (pop. 3,415)* Athens Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania (pop. 5,058)* Athens Township, Crawford County, Pennsylvania (pop. 775)* Athens, Tennessee (pop. 13,220)* Athens, Texas (pop. 11,297)* Athens, Vermont (pop. 340)* Athens, West Virginia (pop. 1,102)* Athens, Wisconsin (pop. 1,095)|}{| ;;|-| valign=top |; CAN Canada:* Athens Township, Ontario (pop. 3,086); CRC Costa Rica:* Atenas (pop. 7,716)* Atenas (canton) (pop. 23,743); GER Germany:* Athenstedt, Saxony-Anhalt (pop.431)| valign=top |; HON Honduras:* Atenas De San Cristóbal, Atlántida Department|Atlántida; ITA Italy:* Atena Lucana, Province of Salerno, Campania (pop. 2,344)* Atina, Province of Frosinone, Lazio (pop. 4,480); POL Poland:* Ateny, Podlaskie Voivodeship (pop. 40); UKR Ukraine:* Afini (Zoria – Зоря), Donetsk (pop. 200)|}See also{||-| valign=top |* Classical Greece* Democracy* Hellenic civilization* Politics of Greece| valign=top |* 2004 Summer Olympics* 1896 Summer Olympics* Eurovision Song Contest 2006* List of museums in Greece** Hellenic Parliament* Peloponnesian War* Age of Pericles| valign=top |* National Library of Greece* Large Cities Climate Leadership Group* National Archaeological Museum, Athens* National Technical University of Athens* Agricultural University of Athens* Athens University of Economics and Business*|}References30emExternal links;Official;Historical;Travel;Visual;;
