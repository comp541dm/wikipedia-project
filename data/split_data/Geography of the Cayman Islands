The trough is the deepest point in the Caribbean Sea and forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. The Cayman Rise extends from southeastern Cuba along the northern margin of the Cayman Trough toward Costa Rica and resulted from Paleocene to Eocene island arc formation with associated volcanism along an extinct subduction zone.  The islands are formed of marine limestone and dolostone that was uplifted during the late Miocene epoch.J.E. Davies and M.A. Brunt (1994), "Scientific Studies in the Cayman Islands", in: , edited by M. A. Brunt. Springer. p. 1. ISBN 9780792324621. Due to the Islands' location, the Cayman Islands do get Earthquakes.ClimateThe Cayman Islands have a tropical marine climate, with a wet season of warm, rainy summers (May to October) and a dry season during the winter (November to April). Terrain is mostly a low-lying limestone base surrounded by coral reefs.Beside Earthquakes another major natural hazard is the tropical cyclones that form during the Atlantic hurricane season from July to November.Environmental issuesAn important environmental issue is the lack of fresh water resources. Drinking water supplies must be met by rainwater catchment and desalination. Destruction of natural resources by the tourism industry and construction of new homes for investors is becoming a great concern to local citizens.Natural resources400pxSunset from North Side beach, Grand CaymanNatural resources include fish and a climate and beaches that foster tourism, which is the islands' major industry. A 2012 estimate of land use determined that the Cayman Islands' had 0.83 percent arable land and 2.08 percent permanent crops.DistrictsThe territory is subdivided into six districts that are governed by district managers and that have a role as electoral districts and as regional units for statistics. Five of the districts are located on the main island, Grand Cayman. The sixth, Sister Islands, comprises the islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac.{| class="wikitable sortable"|-style="background: #EEE;"|-style="background: #CCC;"!
