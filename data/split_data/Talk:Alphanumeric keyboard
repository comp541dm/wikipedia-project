ImageThat keyboard is extremely dirty, and seems to have globs of some mystery substance stuck all over it. Can someone get a better picture? --Edlin2;/tt; 05:50, 29 October 2006 (UTC)Computer architectures have their own keyboards, like the ibm pc XT keyboard, the Amiga keyboard, etc. We need to find a place for this keyboard classification. Tuxisuau: It's already in the article - the bullet list. See IBM_PC_keyboard; you  may add Amiga keyboard.The bulleted list is rather... odd.  I can't exactly understand what it's trying to say... I think there needs to be some explanation of what the list is regarding.

Claritas User talk:Claritas|ยง  18:25, 20 June 2010 (UTC): This article was redundant anyway; once you have a keyboard, the symbols that you can put on it are arbitrary.  It's not like a telephone dial where there's a physical one-to-one correlation with the digit represented and the number of pulses made. How would an article on "alphanumeric keyboard" differ from an article on "alphabetic keyboard" or "numeric keyboard" ? --Wtshymanski (talk) 03:17, 21 June 2010 (UTC)
