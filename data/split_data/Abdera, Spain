'''Abdera''' (, Strabo; , Ptol.; , Ephor. ap. Steph. B.) was an ancient seaport town on the south coast of Spain, between Malaca (now MÃ¡laga) and Carthago Nova (now Cartagena), in the district inhabited by the Bastuli.1911It was founded by the Carthaginians as a trading station, and after a period of decline became under the Romans one of the more important towns in the province of Hispania Baetica. It was situated on a hill above the modern Adra.1911Of its coins, the most ancient bear the Phoenician inscription ''abdrt'' with the head of Melkart and a tunny-fish; those of Tiberius (who seems to have made the place a colonia) show the chief temple of the town with two erect tunny fish in the form of columns.1911References;Attribution*Further reading*
