'''Ambrose of Alexandria''' (before 212 – c. 250) was a friend of the Christian theologian Origen. Ambrose was attracted by Origen's fame as a teacher, and visited the Catechetical School of Alexandria in 212.  At first a gnostic Valentinian and Marcionist, Ambrose, through Origen's teaching, eventually rejected this theology and became Origen's constant companion,Origen, ''Epistle to Sextus Julius Africanus'' vol. i. p. 29 and was ordained deacon.Jerome's De Viris Illustribus # 61.Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' vii. 18 He plied Origen with questions, and urged him to write his Commentaries () on the books of the Bible, and, as a wealthy nobleman and courtier,"DGRBM"he provided his teacher with books for his studies and secretaries to lighten the labor of composition.S.
