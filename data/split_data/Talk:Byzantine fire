A google search turned up 4,590 for Greek fire and 46 for Byzantine fire.  I think that the Byzantine fire version is mainly from the game Age of Empires.  Not, shall we say, a reliable source. ; )  --MichaelTinkler:was it like Greek Fire (although I think we know how that was made...)? edit conflict here -- I think Greek fire was made with pitch and other nasty sticky stuff...JHK
