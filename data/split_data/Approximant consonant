'''Approximants''' are speech sounds that involve the articulators approaching each other but not narrowly enough nor with enough articulatory precision, citing 1996 to create turbulent airflow. Therefore, approximants fall between fricatives, which do produce a turbulent airstream, and vowels, which produce no turbulence."Martínez-Celdrán 2004 201"; This class of sounds includes lateral approximants like  (as in ''less''), non-lateral approximants like  (as in ''rest''), and semivowels like  and  (as in ''yes'' and ''west'', respectively)."Martínez-Celdrán 2004 201"Before Peter Ladefoged coined the term "approximant" in the 1960s,, pointing to  the term "frictionless continuant" referred to non-lateral approximants.SemivowelsSemivowelSome approximants resemble vowels in acoustic and articulatory properties and the terms ''semivowel'' and ''glide'' are often used for these non-syllabic vowel-like segments. The correlation between semivowels and vowels is strong enough that cross-language differences between semivowels correspond with the differences between their related vowels., citing 1985Vowels and their corresponding semivowels alternate in many languages depending on the phonological environment, or for grammatical reasons, as is the case with Indo-European ablaut. Similarly, languages often avoid configurations where a semivowel precedes its corresponding vowel., citing 1982 A number of phoneticians distinguish between semivowels and approximants by their location in a syllable. Although he uses the terms interchangeably,  remarks that, for example, the final glides of English ''par'' and ''buy'' differ from French ''par'' ('through') and ''baille'' ('tub') in that, in the latter pair, the approximants appear in the syllable coda, whereas, in the former, they appear in the syllable nucleus. This means that opaque (if not minimal) contrasts can occur in languages like Italian (with the i-like sound of ''piede'' 'foot', appearing in the nucleus: , and that of ''piano'' 'slow', appearing in the syllable onset: ) and Spanish (with a near minimal pair being ''abyecto''  'abject' and ''abierto''  'opened').:{|class="wikitable" border="1"|-|+Approximant-vowel correspondences!

A transcription with the IPA character for an alveolar approximant () is common, though the sound is more postalveolar. Actual retroflexion may occur as well and both occur as variations of the same sound. citing 1968, 1980, and 1997 However,  makes a distinction between the vowels of American English (which he calls "rhotacized") and vowels with "retroflexion" such as those that appear in Badaga; , on the other hand, labels both as r-colored and notes that both have a lowered third formant.Both cited in: Because the vowels  are articulated with spread lips, spreading is implied for their approximant analogues, .  However, these sounds generally have little or no lip-spreading. The fricative letters with a lowering diacritic, }}, may therefore be justified for a neutral articulation between spread  and rounded . John Esling (2010) "Phonetic Notation", in Hardcastle, Laver ; Gibbon (eds) ''The Handbook of Phonetic Sciences'', 2nd ed., p 699.In articulation and often diachronically, palatal approximants correspond to front vowels, velar approximants to back vowels, and labialized approximants to rounded vowels. In American English, the rhotic approximant corresponds to the rhotic vowel. This can create alternations (as shown in the above table).In addition to alternations, glides can be inserted to the left or the right of their corresponding vowels when they occur next to a hiatus. For example, in Ukrainian, medial  triggers the formation of an inserted  that acts as a syllable onset so that when the affix  is added to футбол ('football') to make футболіст 'football player', it is pronounced , but маоїст ('Maoist'), with the same affix, is pronounced  with a glide. Dutch for many speakers has a similar process that extends to mid vowels:* ''bioscoop'' →  ('cinema')* ''zee'' + ''en'' →  ('seas')* ''fluor'' →  ('fluor')* ''reu'' + ''en'' →  ('male dogs')* ''Rwanda'' →  ('Rwanda')There is dialectal and allophonic variation in the realization of . For speakers who realize it as ,  postulates an additional rule that changes any occurrence of  from glide insertion into .* ''Boaz'' →  ('Boaz')"Dutch"Similarly, vowels can be inserted next to their corresponding glide in certain phonetic environments. Sievers' law describes this behaviour for Germanic.Non-high semivowels also occur. In colloquial Nepali speech, a process of glide-formation occurs, where one of two adjacent vowels becomes non-syllabic; the process includes mid vowels so that  ('cause to wish') features a non-syllabic mid vowel. Spanish features a similar process and even nonsyllabic  can occur so that ''ahorita'' ('right away') is pronounced . It is not often clear, however, whether such sequences involve a semivowel (a consonant) or a diphthong (a vowel), and in many cases, it may not be a meaningful distinction.Although many languages have central vowels , which lie between back/velar  and front/palatal , there are few cases of a corresponding approximant . One is in the Korean diphthong  or [Ahn ; Iverson (2006)] though it is more frequently analyzed as velar (as in the table above), and Mapudungun may be another, with three high vowel sounds, , ,  and three corresponding consonants, , and , and a third one is often described as a voiced unrounded velar fricative; some texts note a correspondence between this approximant and  that is parallel to – and –. An example is ''liq''  (?) ('white').Listen to a [recording]Approximants versus fricativesIn addition to less turbulence, approximants also differ from fricatives in the precision required to produce them.When emphasized, approximants may be slightly fricated (that is, the airstream may become slightly turbulent), which is reminiscent of fricatives. For example, the Spanish word ''ayuda'' ('help') features a palatal approximant that is pronounced as a fricative in emphatic speech. Spanish can be analyzed as having a meaningful distinction between fricative, approximant, and intermediate .Martínez-Celdrán, E. (2004) Problems in the classification of approximants. Journal of the International Phonetic Association, 34, 201–10. However, such frication is generally slight and intermittent, unlike the strong turbulence of fricative consonants.Because voicelessness has comparatively reduced resistance to air flow from the lungs, the increased air flow creates more turbulence, making acoustic distinctions between voiceless approximants (which are extremely rare cross-linguistically) and voiceless fricatives difficult. This is why, for example, the voiceless labialized velar approximant  (also transcribed with the special letter }}) has traditionally been labeled a fricative, and no language is known to contrast it with a voiceless labialized velar fricative . Similarly, Standard Tibetan has a voiceless lateral approximant, , and Welsh has a voiceless lateral fricative , but the distinction is not always clear from descriptions of these languages.  Again, no language is known to contrast the two."Ladefoged 1996 326"Iaai is reported to have an unusually large number of voiceless approximants, with .For places of articulation further back in the mouth, languages do not contrast voiced fricatives and approximants. Therefore the IPA allows the symbols for the voiced fricatives to double for the approximants, with or without a lowering diacritic.Occasionally, the glottal "fricatives" are called approximants, since  typically has no more frication than voiceless approximants, but they are often phonations of the glottis without any accompanying manner or place of articulation.Central approximants*bilabial approximant  (usually transcribed }})*labiodental approximant*dental approximant  (usually transcribed }})*alveolar approximant*retroflex approximant  (a consonantal )*palatal approximant  (a consonantal )*velar approximant  (a consonantal )*uvular approximant  (usually transcribed }})*pharyngeal approximant  (a consonantal ; usually transcribed }})*breathy-voiced glottal approximant*creaky-voiced glottal approximantLateral approximantsIn lateral approximants, the center of tongue makes solid contact with the roof of the mouth.
