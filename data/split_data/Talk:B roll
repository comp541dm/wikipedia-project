I'd like to point out also that separating audio from video also allows great liberty in making potentially unethical edits without those edits being very noticeable.  But I'm not sure if that should go into the main article: first off I don't know if people will realize that immediately, and second I'm not sure if putting that there stains a legitimate practice.  After all, ''most'' documentarians do use B roll footage to hide coughs, sniffs, sneezes, etc. and all the other verbal tics that, uh, a person, um, might have, you know.  Dude.  --KQIs "Roll" supposed to be capitalized or not?  The article is not consistent.  If not, then this article should be moved to the correct (non-capitalized) title.
