It is also commonly used as shorthand for Seventh-day Adventist'''Adventism''' is a branch of Protestantism with origins in the 19th century American Protestant revival known as the Second Great Awakening.The name refers to belief in the imminent Second Coming (or "Second Advent") of Jesus Christ. William Miller started the Adventist movement in the 1830s. His followers became known as Millerites.Although the Adventist churches hold much in common, their theologies differ on whether the intermediate state is unconscious sleep or consciousness, whether the ultimate punishment of the wicked is annihilation or eternal torment, the nature of immortality, whether or not the wicked are resurrected after the millennium, and whether the sanctuary of NKJV refers to the one in heaven or one on earth."Handbook"The movement has encouraged the examination of the whole Bible, leading Seventh-day Adventists and some smaller Adventist groups to observe the Sabbath. The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists has compiled that church's core beliefs in the 28 Fundamental Beliefs (1980 and 2005), which use Biblical references as justification.In 2010, Adventism claimed some 22 million believers scattered in various independent churches. The largest church within the movement — the Seventh-day Adventist Church — is one of the largest Christian churches in the world, with more than 18 million baptized members.Zylstra, Sarah Eekhoff. "" ''Christianity Today''. 2015-01-22. Retrieved 2015-10-13.HistoryGreat DisappointmentAdventism began as an inter-denominational movement. Its most vocal leader was William Miller. Between 50,000 and 100,000 people in the United States supported Miller's predictions of Christ's return. After the "Great Disappointment" of October 22, 1844 many people in the movement gave up on Adventism.  Of those remaining Adventist, the majority gave up believing in any prophetic (biblical) significance for the October 22 date, yet they remained expectant of the near Advent (second coming of Jesus)."Handbook"George Knight, ''A Brief History of Seventh-day AdventistsOf those who retained the October 22 date, many maintained that Jesus had come not literally but "spiritually", and consequently were known as "spiritualizers". A small minority held that something concrete had indeed happened on October 22, but this event had been misinterpreted. This viewpoint later emerged and crystallized with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the largest remaining body today."Handbook""ReferenceA";;;;The development of branches of Adventism in the 19th century.Albany Conference (1845)The Albany Conference in 1845, attended by 61 delegates, was called to attempt to determine the future course and meaning of the Millerite movement. Following this meeting, the "Millerites" then became known as "Adventists" or "Second Adventists". However, the delegates disagreed on several theological points.  Four groups emerged from the conference: The Evangelical Adventists, The Life and Advent Union, the Advent Christian Church, and the Seventh-day Adventist Church.The largest group was organized as the American Millennial Association, a portion of which was later known as the Evangelical Adventist Church."Handbook"Unique among the Adventists, they believed in an eternal hell and consciousness in death. They declined in numbers, and by 1916 their name did not appear in the United States Census of Religious Bodies. It has diminished to almost non-existence today. Their main publication was the ''Advent Herald'', of which Sylvester Bliss was the editor until his death in 1863. It was later called the ''Messiah’s Herald''.The Life and Advent Union was founded by George Storrs in 1863. He had established ''The Bible Examiner'' in 1842. It merged with the Adventist Christian Church in 1964.The Advent Christian Church officially formed in 1861 grew rapidly at first. It declined a little during the 20th century.  The Advent Christians publish the four magazines ''The Advent Christian Witness'', ''Advent Christian News'', ''Advent Christian Missions'' and ''Maranatha''. They also operate a liberal arts college at Aurora, Illinois; and a one-year Bible College in Lenox, Massachusetts called Berkshire Institute for Christian Studies.  The Primitive Advent Christian Church later separated from a few congregations in West Virginia.The Seventh-day Adventist Church officially formed in 1863.  It believes in the sanctity of the seventh-day Sabbath as a holy day for worship.  It published the ''Adventist Review, Kids Review, and Sabbath Herald''.  It has grown to a large worldwide denomination and has a significant network of medical and educational institutions.Miller did not join any of the movements, and he spent the last few years of his life working for unity, before dying in 1849.DenominationsThe ''Handbook of Denominations in the United States'', 12th edn., describes the following churches as "Adventist and Sabbatarian (Hebraic) Churches":ChristadelphiansChristadelphiansThe Christadelphians were founded in 1844 by John Thomas and had an estimated 25,000 members in 170 ecclesias, or churches, in 2000 in America.Advent Christian ChurchAdvent Christian ChurchThe '''Advent Christian Church''' was founded in 1860 and had 25,277 members in 302 churches in 2002 in America.

Hudson and George Storrs who formed the "Advent Christian Association" in Salem, Massachusetts in 1860.Primitive Advent Christian ChurchPrimitive Advent Christian ChurchThe '''Primitive Advent Christian Church''' is a small group which separated from the Advent Christian Church. It differs from the parent body mainly on two points. Its members observe foot washing as a rite of the church, and they teach that reclaimed backsliders should be baptized (even though they had formerly been baptized). This is sometimes referred to as rebaptism.Seventh-day AdventistSeventh-day Adventist ChurchThe '''Seventh-day Adventist Church''', founded in 1863, had over 17,210,000 baptized members (not counting children of members) worldwide as of 2011. It is best known for its teaching that Saturday, the seventh day of the week, is the Sabbath and is the appropriate day for worship. However, it is the second coming of Jesus Christ along with the Judgement day, based on the three angels message in Revelation 14: 6-13, that is the main doctrine of SDA.Seventh Day Adventist Reform MovementSeventh Day Adventist Reform MovementThe '''Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement''' is a small offshoot with an unknown number of members from the Seventh-day Adventist Church caused by disagreement over military service on the Sabbath day during World War I.Davidian Seventh-day Adventist AssociationShepherd's RodThe '''Davidians''' (originally named '''Shepherd's Rod''') is a small offshoot with an unknown number of members made up primarily of voluntarily disfellowshipped members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. They were originally known as the Shepherd's Rod and are still sometimes referred to as such.  The group derives its name from two books on Bible doctrine written by its founder, Victor Houteff, in 1929.;Branch DavidiansThe Branch Davidians were a split ("branch") from the Davidians. Many of them were killed during the infamous Waco Siege of April 1993.Church of God (Seventh Day)General Conference of the Church of God (Seventh-Day)The '''Church of God (Seventh-Day)''' was founded in 1863 and it had an estimated 11,000 members in 185 churches in 1999 in America.

The various groupings of Bible Students currently have a cumulative membership of less than 20,000 worldwide.  Although  Jehovah's Witnesses and Bible Students do not categorize themselves as part of the Millerite Adventist movement (or other denominations, in general), some theologians do categorize the group and schisms as Millerite Adventist because of its teachings regarding an imminent Second Coming and use of specific dates.  As of January 2014 there are approximately 8 million Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide.File:Jyväskylän adventtikirkko.JPG|thumb|250px|An adventist church in Jyväskylä, Finland.See also*Advent Christian Church*Adventist and related churches*List of Christian denominations#Millerites and comparable groups*Seventh-day Adventist Church*Other movements in Adventism**Great Disappointment**William Miller (preacher)**Millennialism**Millerites**Second Great Awakening'''General:'''*Christian revival*Christianity in the 19th centuryReferencesBibliography* Butler, Jonathan.
