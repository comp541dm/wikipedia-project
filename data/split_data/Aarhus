Aarhus (meteorite)'''Aarhus''' (officially spelled '''Århus''' from 1948 until 31 December 2010) () is the second-largest city in Denmark and the seat of Aarhus Municipality. It is located on the east coast of the Jutland peninsula, in the geographical centre of Denmark, km northwest of Copenhagen and km north of Hamburg, Germany. Aarhus' inner urban area contains 261,570 inhabitants (2014) and the municipal population is 330,639 (end of year, 2015). The Larger urban zone population is 845,971 (2013).The history of Aarhus began as a fortified Viking settlement founded in the 8thcentury and with the first written records stemming from the bishopric seated here from at least 948. The city was founded on the northern shores of a Förden and East Jutland Fjorde|fjord at a natural coastal harbour and the primary driver of growth was for centuries seaborne trade in agricultural products. Market town privileges were granted in 1441, but growth stagnated in the 17thcentury as the city suffered blockades and bombardments during the Dano-Swedish War (1658–60)|Swedish Wars. In the 19thcentury it was occupied twice by German troops during the Schleswig Wars but avoided destruction. As the industrial revolution took hold, the city grew to become the second-largest in the country by the 20thcentury.Today Aarhus is at the cultural and economic core of the region and the largest centre for trade, services and industry in Jutland. The city ranks as the 92nd largest city in the European Union, and as number 234 among world cities.List of largest cities of the European Union by population within city limits It is also a top 100 conference city in the world. Aarhus is the principal industrial port of the country in terms of container handling and an important trade hub in Kattegat. Major Danish companies have based their headquarters here and people commute for work and leisure from a wide area in Region Midtjylland. It is a centre for research and education in the Nordic countries and home to Aarhus University, Scandinavia's largest university, including Aarhus University Hospital and INCUBA Science Park. Being the youngest city in Denmark, with students (55,000) making up 13% of the population, Aarhus is also one of the fastest growing, with an average growth of 4,000 people per annum since 2010. The city is a central part of the East Jutland metropolitan area, the second largest area of population (1.26 million people) and economic growth in Denmark.Aarhus is notable for its musical history. In the 1950s many jazz clubs sprang up around the city, fuelled by the young population. By the 1960s, the music scene diversified into rock and other genres. In the 1970s and 1980s, Aarhus became the centre for Denmark's rock music fostering many iconic bands such as TV-2 and Gnags. Aarhus is home to the annual eight-day Aarhus International Jazz Festival, the SPoT Festival and the Northside Festival.EtymologyIn Valdemar's Census Book (1231) the city was called ''Arus'', and in Icelandic it was known as ''Aros'', later written as Aars. It is a compound of the two words ''ār'', genitive of ''ā'' ("river", Modern Danish ''å''), and ''ōss'' ("mouth", in Modern Icelandic this word is still used for "river delta"). The name originates from the city's location around the mouth of Aarhus Å (Aarhus River). The spelling "Aarhus" is first found in 1406 and gradually became the norm in the 17thcentury.Salmonsen;Aarhus/Århus spellingWith the Å#Origin|Danish spelling reform of 1948, "Aa" was changed to "Å". Some Danish cities resisted the new spelling of their names, notably Aalborg and Aabenraa. Århus city council explicitly embraced the new spelling, as it was thought to enhance an image of progressiveness. In 2010, the city council voted to change the name from "Århus" to "Aarhus" in order to strengthen the international profile of the city. The renaming came into effect on 1 January 2011.Certain geographically affiliated names have been updated to reflect the name of the city, such as the Aarhus River, changed from "Århus Å" to "Aarhus Å"."The Aarhus River"It is still grammatically correct to write geographical names with the letter Å and local councils are allowed to use the Aa spelling as an alternative. Whichever spelling local authorities choose most newspapers and public institutions will accept it. Some official authorities such as the Dansk Sprognævn|Danish Language Committee, publisher of the Danish Orthographic Dictionary, still retain "Århus" as the main name, providing "Aarhus" as a new, second option, in brackets.HistoryTimeline of AarhusEarly historyFounded in the early Viking Age, Aarhus is one of the oldest cities in Denmark, along with Ribe and Hedeby.. On the history and foundation of the city. Kommuneatlas is a public on-line source on the municipality of Aarhus.Achaeological evidence under the Aros settlement's defences indicate the site was a town as early as the last quarter of the 8thcentury, considerably earlier than had been generally supposed.[The earliest Århus] [The Viking Museum]  Discoveries after a 2003 archaeological dig unearthed half buried longhouses, firepits, glass pearls and a road dated to the late 700s. Archaeologists have conducted several excavations in the inner city since the 1960s revealing wells, streets, homes and workshops. In the buildings and adjoining archaeological layers, everyday utensils like combs, jewellery and basic multi-purpose tools from approximately the year 900 have been found.The centre of Aarhus was once a pagan burial site until Aarhus' first church, Holy Trinity Church, a timber structure, was built upon it during the reign of Frode, King of Jutland, around 900. In the 900s an earth rampart for the defence of the early city was constructed, encircling the settlement, much like the defence structures found at ring fortresses elsewhere. The rampart was later reinforced by Harald Bluetooth, and together with the town's geographical placement, this suggests that Aros was an important trade and military centre. There are strong indications of a former royal residence from the Viking Age in Viby, a few kilometres south of the Aarhus city centre.[Vikingernes Aros] VikingemuseetThe bishopric of Aarhus dates back to at least 948 when Adam of Bremen reported the bishop Reginbrand attended the synod of Ingelheim in Germany. The bishopric and the town's geographical location propelled prosperous growth and development of the early medieval town. The finding of six runestones in and around Aarhus indicates the city had some significance around the year 1000, as only wealthy nobles traditionally used them. The era was turbulent and violent with several naval attacks on the city, such as Harald Hardrada's assault around 1050, when the Holy Trinity Church was burned to the ground."Kristeligt"Middle AgesFile:Aarhus domkirke.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Aarhus Cathedral (1300)The growing influence of the Church during the Middle Ages gradually turned Aarhus, with its bishopric, into a prosperous religious centre. Many public and religious buildings were built in and around the city; notably Aarhus Cathedral was initiated in the late 12thcentury by the influential bishop Peder Vognsen.In 1441 Christopher III issued the oldest known charter granting market town status although similar privileges may have existed as far back as the 12thcentury. The charter is the first official recognition of the town as a regional power and is by some considered Aarhus' birth certificate.File:Århus set fra nord. Stik fra Erich Pontoppidan Den danske Atlas (bd. 4)..JPG|thumb|left|upright=1|Aarhus seen from north, 1768, by Erik PontoppidanThe official and religious status spurred growth so in 1477 the defensive earthern ramparts, ringing the town since the Viking age, were removed to accommodate expansion. Aarhus grew to become one of the largest cities in the country by the early 16thcentury. In 1657 octroi was imposed in larger Danish cities which changed the layout and face of Aarhus over the following decades. Wooden city walls were erected to prevent smuggling, with gates and toll booths on the major thoroughfares, Mejlgade and Studsgade. The city gates funnelled most traffic through a few streets where merchant quarters were built.In the 17thcentury, Aarhus entered a period of recession as it suffered blockades and bombardments during the Dano-Swedish War (1658–60)|Swedish wars and trade was dampened by the preferential treatment of the capital by the state."Olsen2000"It was not until the middle of the 18thcentury growth returned in large part due to trade with the large agricultural catchment areas around the city; particularly grain proved to be a remunerative export."Danmarkshistorien"The first factories were established at this time as the industrial revolution reached the country and in 1810 the harbour was expanded to accommodate growing trade.IndustrialisationView of Aarhus, 1850Following the Napoleonic wars, Denmark lost Norway and was excluded from international trade for some years which caused a recession for Aarhus' trade based economy that lasted until the 1830s. The economy turned around as the industrial revolution reached the city and  factories with steam-driven machinery became more productive.In 1838, the electoral laws were reformed leading to elections for the 15 seats on the city council. The rules were initially very strict allowing only the wealthiest citizens to run. In the 1844 elections only 174 citizens qualified out of a total population of more than 7,000. The first city council, mainly composed of wealthy merchants and industrialists, quickly looked to improve the harbour, situated along the Aarhus River. Larger ships and growing freight volumes made a river harbour increasingly impractical. In 1840, the harbour was moved to the coast, north of the river where it became the largest industrial harbour outside Copenhagen over the following 15 years. From the outset, the new harbour was controlled by the city council, as it is to this day.File:Preussiske soldater inddriver kvæg ved Domkirken. Set fra Mejlgade (Kunstner Hans Frederik Meyer Visby) 1864.jpg|left|thumb|Prussian soldiers herding cattle by Aarhus cathedral, 1864During the First Schleswig War Aarhus was occupied by German troops from 21 June to 24 July 1849. The city was spared any fighting, but in Vejlby north of the city a cavalry skirmish known as Skirmish of Århus|Rytterfægtningen took place which stopped the German advance through Jutland. The war and occupation left a notable impact on the city as many streets, particularly in Frederiksbjerg, are named after Danish officers of the time. Fifteen years later, in 1864, the city was occupied again, this time for seven months, during the Second Schleswig War.In spite of wars and occupation the city continued to develop. In 1851 octroi was abolished and the city walls were removed to provide easier access for trade. Regular steamship links with Copenhagen had begun in 1830 and in 1862 Jutland's first railway was established between Aarhus and Randers."Byhistorie.dk"''Toldkammeret'' (Custom House, 1898)In the second half of the 19thcentury industrialisation came into full effect and a number of new industries emerged around production and refinement of agricultural products, especially oil and butter. Many companies from this time would come to leave permanent iconic marks on Aarhus. The Ceres Brewery was established in 1856 and served as Aarhus' local brewery for more than 150 years, gradually expanding into an industrial district known as Ceres-grunden (lit.: ''the Ceres-grounds''). In 1896 local farmers and businessmen created KFK (Korn- og Foderstof Kompagniet), focused on grain and feedstuffs. KFK established departments all over the country, while its headquarters remained in Aarhus where its large grain silos still stand today.Ib Gejl, Flemming Just, Carsten Porskrog Rasmussen (1996): ''Fra købmandsgård til koncern.

Jansen: ''Korn, købmænd ; kornkompagni. Korn- og foderstofhandelen 1880’erne – 1960’erne'', Århus 1971.  Otto Mønsted created the Danish Preserved Butter Company in 1874, focusing on butter export to England, China and Africa and later founded the Aarhus Butterine Company in 1883, the first Danish margarine factory. The industry became an important employer, with factory employees increasing from 100 in 1896 to 1,000 in 1931, effectively transforming the city from a regional trade hub into an industrial centre. Other new factories of note include the dockyard of Flydedokken and the oil mill of Aarhus Oliefabrik A/S|Århus Oliefabrik.Aarhus became the largest provincial city in the country by the turn of the century and the city marketed itself as the "Capital of Jutland". The population increased from 15,000 in 1870 to 52,000 in 1901 and in response the city annexed large land areas to develop new residential quarters such as Trøjborg, Frederiksbjerg and Marselisborg. Many of its cultural institutions were also established at this time such as the Aarhus Theatre (1900), the national library (1902), Aarhus University (1928) and several hospitals.Aarhus Amtssygehus was established in 1882 (moved and expanded in 1935), Århus Kommunehospital was established in 1893 and Marselisborg Hospital was built in 1913.

The resistance rounds up collaborators, Cheering crowds celebrate..jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.95|Liberation celebrations, 1945On 9April1940, German troops invaded Denmark and occupied the city, establishing their headquarters in the university and from 1943 the Gestapo based their headquarters for Jutland there as well. In the later years of the war Aarhus became an important transport hub for seaborne supplies to Norway. On 4July1944, a freight barge loaded with ammunition exploded in the harbour, killing 33 people and causing significant destruction to the harbour area.Resistance fighters under fire, Bispetorv, 1945In 1944 the resistance movement in Jutland encouraged the Allies to conduct an air raid against the German headquarters in Aarhus to destroy files and obstruct operations. On 31 October the Aarhus Air Raid saw a "daring, low-level precision bombing attack" on the Gestapo headquarters in Aarhus by 25 Mosquitoes from the Number 140 Wing of the RAF Second Tactical Air Force. Resistance leader Pastor Harald Sandbaek was being held captive there at the time. The bombs dropped in the centre of the former University of Aarhus building, killing an estimated 150–200 Gestapo members and some 30 Danes while destroying German files on the Danish resistance.Several Schalburgtage operations took place between August1944 and May1945, when the occupation ended. The largest occurred on the night of 22February1945 when a series of explosions in central Aarhus destroyed or damaged a number of buildings, including Aarhus Teater. Other such operations included two attempts at destroying Aarhus City Hall, recently completed in 1941.The surrender of German forces officially came into effect on 5May1945 but in Aarhus fighting broke out shortly before midday between resistance fighters and a small German force that refused surrender. The fighting claimed the lives of both resistance fighters and civilians but by the end of the day order was restored and on 8 May British forces entered the city, officially liberating it.Post-war yearsFile:Aarhus docklands by night.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Urban development in Aarhus city centre, 2013In the 1980s the city entered a period of rapid growth and the service sector overtook trade, industry and crafts as the leading sector of employment for the first time. Workers gradually began commuting to the city from most of east and central Jutland as the region became more interconnected. The student population tripled between 1965 and 1977 turning the city into a Danish centre of research and education. The growing and comparably young population initiated a period of creativity and optimism; Gaffa and the KaosPilot school were founded in 1983 and 1991 respectively, and Aarhus was at the centre of a renaissance in Danish rock and pop music launching bands and musicians such as TV2, Gnags, Thomas Helmig, Bamses Venner, Anne Dorte Michelsen, Mek Pek and Shit ; Chanel.Since the turn of the millennium both skyline and land use has changed as former industrial sites are being redeveloped into new city districts. Starting in 2007, the former docklands are being converted to a new mixed use district dubbed "Aarhus Ø" (Aarhus Docklands). The site of the former Royal Unibrew Ceres breweries began redevelopment in 2012 into "CeresByen", a residential district with educational institutions. The former DSB repair facilities at Frederiks Plads have been demolished and are being developed into a new business district with high-rise buildings scheduled for completion in 2017. The main bus terminal is planned to be moved to the central railway station by 2018 and the current site will be made into a new residential district. Construction of the first light rail system in the city commenced in 2013, with the first increment to be finished in 2017. The light rail system is planned to eventually tie many of the suburbs closer to central Aarhus. The next phase will connect a large planned suburb west of Lisbjerg.Accelerating growth since the early 2000s brought the inner urban area to roughly 260,000 inhabitants by 2014. The rapid growth is expected to continue until at least 2030 when Aarhus municipality has set an ambitious target for 375,000 inhabitants.GeographyAarhus is located at the Bay of Aarhus facing the Kattegat sea in the east with the peninsulas of Mols and Helgenæs across the bay to the northeast. Mols and Helgenæs are both part of the larger regional peninsula of Djursland. A number of larger cities and towns is within easy reach from Aarhus by road and rail, including Randers (km by road north), Grenå (northeast), Horsens (km south) and Silkeborg (km east).TopographyFile:Egådalen (juli).jpg|thumb|right|Egådalen. A broad and flat valley, marking the northern limits of AarhusAt Aarhus' location, the Bay of Aarhus provides a natural harbour with a depth of  quite close to the shore. Aarhus was founded at the mouth of a brackish water Förden and East Jutland Fjorde|fjord, but the original fjord no longer exists, as it has gradually narrowed into what is now the Aarhus River and the Brabrand Lake, due to natural sedimentation. The land around Aarhus was once covered by forests, remains of which exist in parts of Marselisborg Forest to the south and Riis Skov to the north. Several larger lakes extend west from the Skanderborg railway junction and the landscape rises to heights exceeding ft at Himmelbjerget, forming part of the larger region called Søhøjlandet.The hilly area around Aarhus consists of a moranial plateau from the last ice age, broken by a complex system of tunnel valleys. The most prominent valleys of this network are the Aarhus Valley in the south, stretching inland east-west with the Aarhus River, Brabrand Lake and Tåstrup Sø (Tåstrup Lake) and the Egå|Egå Valley to the north, with the stream of Egåen, Kasted Mose (Kasted Bog) and Geding Sø (Geding Lake). Most parts of the two valleys have been drained and subsequently farmed, but recently some of the drainage was removed for environmental reasons. The valley system also includes the Lyngbygård Å (Lyngbygård River) in the west and valleys to the south of the city, following erosion channels from the pre-quaternary. By contrast, the Aarhus River Valley and the Giber River Valley are late glacial meltwater valleys. The coastal cliffs along the Bay of Aarhus consist of shallow tertiary clay from the Eocene and Oligocene (57 to 24 million years ago). Århus Amt. See also Jeksendalen and Pilbrodalen.  NTSnet. Educational material with relevant links. Bygninger og miljøer i Århus Kommune: [Kommuneatlas - Landskab og bebyggelse], GISPortalenClimate}}Aarhus is in the humid continental climate zone (Köppen climate classification|Köppen: ''Dfb'')  and the weather is influenced by low-pressure systems from the Atlantic which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Temperature varies a great deal across the seasons with a mild spring in April and May, warmer summer months from June to August, frequently rainy and windy autumn months in October and September and cooler winter months, often with snow and frost, from December to March. The city centre experiences the same climatic effects as other larger cities with higher wind speeds, more fog, less precipitation and higher temperatures than the surrounding, open land.Western winds from the Atlantic and North Sea are dominant resulting in more precipitation in western Denmark. In addition, Jutland rises sufficiently in the centre to lift air to higher, colder altitudes contributing to increased precipitation in eastern Jutland. Combined these factors make east and south Jutland comparatively wetter than other parts of the country. Average temperature over the year is  with February being the coldest month (0.1°C) and August the warmest (15.9°C). Temperatures in the sea can reach 17 to 22 degrees Celsius in June to August, but it is not uncommon for beaches to register 25 degrees Celsius locally."WeatherOnline"The geography in the area affects the local climate of the city with the Aarhus Bay imposing a temperate effect on the low-lying valley floor where central Aarhus is located. Brabrand Lake to the west further contributes to this effect and as a result the valley has a very mild, temperate climate. The sandy ground on the valley floor dries up quickly after winter and warms faster in the summer than the surrounding hills of moist-retaining boulder clay. These conditions affect crops and plants that often bloom 1–2 weeks earlier in the valley than on the northern and southern hillsides.Because of the northern latitude, the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 2 minutes of daylight. The difference in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices is 10 hours and 30 minutes.Politics and administrationFile:Aarhus Rådhus tårn.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Aarhus City Hall tower from 1942, designed by Arne Jacobsen and Erik MøllerList of mayors of AarhusAarhus is the seat of Aarhus Municipality and Aarhus City Council (''Aarhus Byråd'') is also the municipal government. The Mayor of Aarhus until 2017 is Jacob Bundsgaard of the Social Democrats. Municipal elections are held every fourth year on the third Tuesday of November. The city council consists of 31 members elected for four-year terms. When an election has determined the composition of the council, it elects a mayor, two deputy mayors and five aldermen from their ranks. Anyone who is eligible to vote and who resides within Aarhus municipality can run for a seat on the city council provided they can secure endorsements and signatures from 50 inhabitants of the municipality.Administratively the city is divided into six minor agencies which together constitute the magistrate led by the mayor and five aldermen as administrative directors. It is the only Danish city with a magistrate structure. The six departments of the city are the ''Mayor's Department'', ''Social Affairs and Employment'', ''Technical Services and Environment'', ''Health and Care'', ''Culture and Citizens Services'' and ''Children and Young People'' which handle all the day-to-day operations of the city.Politically Aarhus leans left and the largest political party has historically been the Social Democratic Party which has also held the mayor's office for all terms with the notable exception of the 2001–2005 term when Louise Gade of Venstre became both the first female and non-Social Democratic mayor. The gender composition of the city council has risen steadily in favour of women through the 20thcentury and currently 9 of 31 members are women.The first publicly elected mayor of Aarhus was appointed in 1919. In the 1970 Danish Municipal Reform the current Aarhus municipality was created by merging 20 municipalities. Aarhus was the seat of Aarhus County until the 2007 Danish municipal reform, which substituted the Danish counties with five regions and replaced Aarhus County with Central Denmark Region (''Region Midtjylland''), seated in Viborg.{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto; width:90%;"|+'''Political party composition of Aarhus Municipal Council'''| style="background:#E6E6E6; text-align: center;" | Year| style="background:#ab2521; text-align: center;" | Social Democrats (Denmark)|A| style="background:#833a93; text-align: center;" | Danish Social Liberal Party|B| style="background:#8CA323; text-align: center;" | Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|C| style="background:#CB096D; text-align: center;" | Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|F| style="background:#1EAFB7; text-align: center;" | Liberal Alliance (Denmark)|I| style="background:#F2D451; text-align: center;" | Danish People's Party|O| style="background:#294D75; text-align: center;" | Venstre (Denmark)|V| style="background:#FF0000; text-align: center;" | Left Socialists|Y| style="background:#FFC90E; text-align: center;" | Progress Party (Denmark)|Z| style="background:#ED7F1A; text-align: center;" | Red–Green Alliance (Denmark)|Ø| style="background:#E6E6E6; text-align: center;" | Other| style="background:#E6E6E6; text-align: center;" | %| style="background:#E6E6E6; text-align: center;" | Female|'';#9792;''| style="background:#E6E6E6; text-align: center;" | Male|'';#9794;''| style="background:#E6E6E6; text-align: center;" | Mandate distribution|-style="text-align: center"| style="background:#E6E6E6;"|1970|''17''||''2''||''8''||''1''||||||''3''||||||||||70.3||4||27|- style="text-align: center"| style="background:#E6E6E6;"|1974|''13''||''2''||''4''||''2''||||||''4''||''1''||''2''||||''3''||58.1||6||25|-style="text-align: center"| style="background:#E6E6E6;"|1978|''13''||''2''||''5''||''3''||||||''3''||''1''||''2''||||''2''||68.7||8||23|-style="text-align: center"| style="background:#E6E6E6;"|1981|''11''||''1''||''6''||''5''||||||''3''||''2''||''1''||||''2''||68.6||11||20|-style="text-align: center"| style="background:#E6E6E6;"|1985|''12''||''1''||''7''||''7''||||||''2''||''1''||||||''1''||65.6||12||19|-style="text-align: center"| style="background:#E6E6E6;"|1989|''12''||''1''||''5''||''6''||||||''3''||||''1''||''2''||''1''||63.1||11||20|-style="text-align: center"| style="background:#E6E6E6;"|1993|''15''||''1''||''3''||''4''||||||''6''||||''1''||''1''||||68.4||12||19|-style="text-align: center"| style="background:#E6E6E6;"|1997|''13''||''1''||''3''||''4''||||''2''||''7''||||||''1''||||70.5||13||18|-style="text-align: center"| style="background:#E6E6E6;"|2001|''11''||''2''||''2''||''3''||||''1''||''11''||||||''1''||||85.13||6||25|-style="text-align: center"| style="background:#E6E6E6;"|2005|''13''||''2''||''1''||''2''||||''1''||''11''||||||''1''||||71.80||8||23|-style="text-align: center"| style="background:#E6E6E6;"|2009|''14''||''1''||''3''||''5''||||''2''||''5''||||||''1''||||63.70||13||18|-style="text-align: center"| style="background:#E6E6E6;"|2013|''13''||''2''||''2''||''2''||''1''||''2''||''6''||||||''3''||||70.49||9||22|-| colspan="16" style="font-size: 75%; background:#E6E6E6;" | ''Data from Statistics Denmark, KMD, ODAA.dk, Aarhus Municipality.''|}Districts and subdivisionsFile:Aarhus municipality with districts.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Locator map of districts in Aarhus municipality and neighbourhoods in ''Midtbyen''Administrative divisions of Aarhus MunicipalityAarhus municipality has 45 electoral wards and polling stations in four electoral districts for the folketing. The diocese of Aarhus has four deaneries composed of 60 parishes within Aarhus municipality. Aarhus municipality contains 21 postal districts and some parts of another 9. The urban area of Aarhus and the immediate suburbs are divided into the districts Aarhus C, Aarhus N, Aarhus V, Viby J, Højbjerg and Brabrand.Aarhus is segmented into districts on different levels often containing several distinct neighbourhoods within them. The historical centre, known as ''Indre By'' (lit. English, "Inner City"), includes the neighbourhoods ''Centralværkstedet'', the Latin Quarter and the areas around the Central Station and Aarhus Concert Hall. The inner city beltway Ring 1 contains the larger district Midtbyen (lit. Town Centre), roughly equivalent to postal district Aarhus C, and is composed of the neighbourhoods Indre By, Vesterbro, Frederiksbjerg, Aarhus Docklands|Aarhus Ø, Marselisborg and Nørre Stenbro.North of the inner beltway lies the district Aarhus N, containing the neighbourhoods Trøjborg, Risskov, Vejlby, Skejby, Christiansbjerg and Vorrevangen and to the west lies Langenæs, Åbyhøj and Aarhus V, comprising the neighbourhoods Hasle, Frydenlund, Herredsvang and Møllevangen, while the district of Højbjerg lies to the south. Districts and suburbs further out are Brabrand, Egå, Gellerup, Hasselager, Holme, Kolt, Rosenhøj, Skæring, Skåde, Slet, Stavtrup, Tilst and Tranbjerg.Environmental planningEnergy in DenmarkAarhus has increasingly been investing in environmental planning. The city council has identified a number of environmental targets for the coming years within energy efficiency and aquatic environment. The targets are designed to provide the guidelines for green growth in the city.[Targets] Aarhus Municipality State of Green In accordance with national policy, Aarhus aims to be CO2 neutral and independent of fossil fuels for heating by 2030. These goals have materialised in a plan to increase multiple-source heat production and the waste and district heating service ''AffaldVarme Aarhus'' is building a combined heat and power plant running on biofuels.Aarhus has been heavily involved with several large-scale water treatment projects on many levels in the last two decades and more will follow in the future. The initiatives are part of a larger and broader action plan for Aarhus municipality, that aims for a coherent and holistic administration of the water cycle. This should protect against or clean up previous pollution and encourage green growth and self-sufficiency. One of the main tasks is to deal with the large quantities of excessive nutrients in and around Aarhus, primarily nitrogen and phosphorus. A second task is to tackle the increasing levels of precipitation brought about by current and future climate change, and a third important task is to secure fresh, clean and safe drinking water for the future.File:True Skov 9.jpg|thumb|Recent afforestation in True SkovAarhus Municipality and the city council have attacked the challenges from different angles in a constructive collaboration with private partners. Many new underground rainwater basins have been built across the city in recent years. The two lakes of Brabrand Lake|Årslev Engsø and Egå Engsø were created in 2003 and 2006 respectively. Large expanses of forest have been planted in vulnerable land areas in order to secure drinking water and avoid groundwater pollution from pesticides and other sources. Since 1988, the New Forests of Aarhus have been developed to assist in binding CO2, securing drinking water, protecting groundwater from pollution, dealing with excessive nutrients, increasing biodiversity, creating an attractive countryside, providing easy access to nature and offering outdoor activities to the public. The afforestation plans were realised as a local project in collaboration with private landowners, under a larger national agenda, and there are new afforestation objectives to double the forest cover in Aarhus municipality, before the year 2030.DemographicsReligion in DenmarkFile:Aarhus population-1672-2014.svg|thumb|right|upright=1|Population 1672–2014{| class="infobox" style="float:left;"|colspan="2"|'''Main immigrant groups, 2014'''|-\!

With some 500,000 people in the neighbouring municipalities comprising the region of East Jutland, the larger urban zone of Aarhus has 845,971 inhabitants. Less than a fifth of the municipal population resides beyond city limits and almost all live in an urban area.The population of Aarhus is both younger and better-educated than the national average which can be attributed to the high concentration of educational institutions. More than 40% of the population have an academic degree while only some 14% have no secondary education or trade. The largest age group is 20- to 29-year-olds and the average age is 37.5, making it the youngest city in the country and one of its youngest municipalities."Danmarks Statistik: FOLK1"Women have slightly outnumbered men for many years."Danmarks Statistik: FOLK1"{| border="1" cellpadding="1" width="190px" bgcolor="#F8F8F8" style="padding-left: 2cm; float: right; font-size: 70%; border-collapse: collapse;"|+ '''Religious affiliation'''!Affiliation!!Members!!%|-|style="padding-left: 3px;" | Church of Denmark ||style="padding-left: 3px;" | 233,603 ||style="padding-left: 3px;" | 72.12%|-|style="padding-left: 3px;" | No affiliation || style="padding-left: 3px;" | 74,190 || style="padding-left: 3px;" | 22.91%|-|style="padding-left: 3px;" | Other Christian || style="padding-left: 3px;" | 7,400 || style="padding-left: 3px;" | 2.28%|-|style="padding-left: 3px;" | Islamic denominations || style="padding-left: 3px;" | 6,000 || style="padding-left: 3px;" | 1.85%|-|style="padding-left: 3px;" | Hinduism || style="padding-left: 3px;" | 1,400 || style="padding-left: 3px;" | 0.43%|-|style="padding-left: 3px;" | Other religion || style="padding-left: 3px;" | 700 || style="padding-left: 3px;" | 0.22%|-|style="padding-left: 3px;" | Buddhism || style="padding-left: 3px;" | 600 || style="padding-left: 3px;" | 0.19%|}The city is home to 75 different religious groups and denominations most of which are Christian or Muslim with a smaller number of Buddhist and Hindu communities. Since the 1990s there has been a marked growth in diverse new spiritual groups although the total number of followers remains small."Aarhus 2013 religion i forandring"The majority of the population are members of the Protestant state church, Church of Denmark, which is by far the largest religious institution both in the city and the country as a whole. Some 20% of the population are not officially affiliated with any religion, a percentage that has been slowly rising for many years.Aarhus has the highest ratio of immigrants in Denmark, 14.8% of the population, outside the Copenhagen area. During the 1990s there was significant immigration from Turkey and in recent years, there has been high growth in the overall immigrant community, from 27,783 people in 1999 to 40,431 in 2008. The majority of immigrants have roots outside Europe and the developed world, comprising some 25,000 people from 130 different nationalities, with the largest groups coming from the Middle East and north Africa. Some 15,000 have come from within Europe, with Poland, Germany, Romania and Norway being the largest contributors."Danmarks Statistik: FOLK1"Many immigrants have established themselves in Brabrand, Hasle and Viby, where the percentage of inhabitants with foreign origins has risen by 66% since the year 2000. This has resulted in several 'especially vulnerable residential areas' (a.k.a. ghettos), with Gellerup as the most notable neighbourhood. In Brabrand and Gellerup, two thirds of the population now have a non-Danish ethnic background.  The international cultures present in the community are an obvious and visible part of the city's daily life and contribute many cultural flavours hitherto uncommon for the Nordic countries, including Bazar Vest, a market with shopkeepers predominantly of foreign descent.EconomyThe economy of Aarhus is predominantly knowledge and service based, strongly influenced by the University of Aarhus and the large healthcare industry. The service sector dominates the economy and is growing as the city is transitioning away from manufacturing. Trade and transportation remain important sectors benefiting from the large port and central position on the rail network. Manufacturing has been in slow but steady decline since the 1960s while agriculture long has been a marginal employer within the municipality. The municipality is home to 175,000 jobs with some 100,000 in the private sector and the rest split between state, region and municipality."Aarhus Kommune"The region is a major agricultural producer, with many large farms in the outlying districts.File:De fem søstre i århus perspetiv korrekt.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Silos from 1927 known as the "Five Sisters"The job market is knowledge and service based and the largest employment sectors are healthcare and social services, trade, education, consulting, research, industry and telecommunications. The municipality has more high and middle income jobs, and fewer low income jobs, than the national average."Aarhus Kommune"Today the majority of the largest companies in the municipality are in the sectors of trade, transport and media. The wind power industry has strong roots in Aarhus, and the larger region of Midtjylland, and nationally most of the revenue in the industry is generated by companies in the greater Aarhus area. The wind industry employs about a thousand people within the municipality making it a central component in the local economy. The biotech industry is well established in the city with many small and medium-sized companies mainly focused on research and development.The city has become a leading centre for retail in the Nordic and Baltic countries with expansive shopping centres, the busiest commercial street in the country and a dense urban core with many specialty shops. People commute to Aarhus from as far away as Randers, Silkeborg and Skanderborg and almost a third of those employed within Aarhus municipality commute from neighbouring communities.Several major companies have their headquarters in Aarhus such as Arla Foods, one of the largest dairy groups in Europe, Dansk Supermarked A/S|Dansk Supermarked, Denmark's largest retailer, Jysk, a world-wide retailer specializing in household goods, bedding, furniture and interior design, Vestas, one of the major wind turbine producers worldwide, and several leading retail companies.dsdIn total four of the 10 largest companies in the country are based in the municipality. Since the early 2000s the city has experienced an influx of larger companies moving from other parts of the Jutland peninsula.  Other large employers of note include Krifa (a trades union organisation) and 5R, a telemarketing company, while metallurgy and electronics remain important sectors.dsdPort of AarhusPort of AarhusFile:Eleonora in Aarhus (8789315200).jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|right|Eleonora Maersk in the Port of AarhusThe Port of Aarhus is one of the largest industrial ports in northern Europe with the largest container terminal in Denmark, processing more than 50% of Denmark's container traffic and accommodating the largest container vessels in the world. It is a municipal self-governing port with independent finances. The facilities handle some 9.5 million tonnes of cargo a year (2012). Grain is the principal export, while feedstuffs, stone, cement and coal are among the chief imports. Since 2012 the port has faced increasing competition from the Port of Hamburg and freight volumes have decreased somewhat from the peak in 2008."Signe Ferslev Pedersen"The ferry terminal presents the only alternative to the Great Belt Link for passenger transport between Jutland and Zealand. It has served different ferry companies since the first steamship route to Copenhagen opened in 1830. Currently Mols-Linien operates the route and annually transports some 2 million passengers and a million vehicles. Additional roll-on/roll-off cargo ferries serve Finland and Kalundborg on a weekly basis and smaller outlying Danish ports at irregular intervals. Since the early 2000s the port has increasingly become a destination for cruise lines operating in the Baltic Sea.TourismThe ARoS Art Museum, the Old Town Museum and Tivoli Friheden are among Denmark's top tourist attractions. With a combined total of almost 1.4 million visitors they represent the driving force behind tourism but other venues such as Moesgård Museum and Kvindemuseet are also popular. The city's extensive shopping facilities are also said to be a major attraction for tourists, as are festivals, especially NorthSide and SPOT. Many visitors arrive on cruise ships: in 2012, 18 vessels visited the port with over 38,000 passengers.Costa Pacifica in the harbourIn the 2010s there has been a significant expansion of tourist facilities, culminating in the opening of the 240-room Comwell Hotel in July 2014, which increased the number of hotel rooms in the city by 25%. Some estimates put the number of visitors spending at least one night as high as 750,000 a year, most of them Danes from other regions, the remainder coming mainly from Norway, Sweden, northern Germany and the United Kingdom. Overall, they spend about DKK 3 billion ($540 million) in the city each year. The primary motivation for tourists choosing Aarhus as a destination is experiencing the city and culture, family and couples vacation or as a part of a round trip in Denmark. The average stay is little more than three days on average."kulturturisme.dk"There are more than 30 tourist information spots across the city, some of them staffed, while others are on-line, publicly accessible touch screens. The official tourist information service in Aarhus is organised under VisitAaarhus, a corporate foundation initiated in 1994 by Aarhus Municipality and local commercial interest organisations.Research parksIT City Katrinebjerg.Over the past ten years, Aarhus has been one of Denmark's most rapidly developing centres of research in information technology, energy, media, life sciences, food, architecture and design. Enterprises in the Information and communications technology (ICT) sphere work in collaboration with the city's research institutes. In 2007 the three largest research parks of Forskerpark Aarhus (Science Park Aarhus), Forskerpark Skejby (Science Park - Skejby) and IT-Huset Katrinebjerg, merged to form INCUBA Science Park. Forskerpark Skejby, which works in the field of biomedical research, and the Katrinebjerg department - focusing on ICT - has since been expanded and in 2014 the new department of INCUBA Navitas opened on the Aarhus Docklands.One of the major research companies is Systematic A/S, working in the public sector, healthcare and defence.

Many architectural styles are represented in different parts of the city such as Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, National Romantic, Nordic classicism, Neoclassical, Empire and Functionalism. The city has grown up around the main transport hubs, the harbour and later the railway station and as a result, the oldest parts of the city are also the most central and busiest today.The streets Volden (lit ''Rampart'') and Graven (lit. ''Moat'') testify to the defences of the initial Viking settlement and ''Allégaderingen'' in Midtbyen roughly follows the boundaries of that settlement. The street network in the inner city formed during the Middle Ages with narrow, curved streets and low, dense housing by the river and coast. ''Vesterport'' (lit. ''Western Gate'') still bears the name of a medieval city gate and the narrow alleyways ''Posthussmøgen'' and ''Telefonsmøgen'' are remnants of toll stations from that time. The inner city has the oldest preserved houses, especially the Latin Quarter, with buildings dating back to the early 17thcentury in Mejlgade and Skolegade.Olsen2000Medieval merchants' mansions with courtyards can be seen in Klostergade, Studsgade and Skolegade.LandmarksFile:Bispetorv i århus.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.7|Bispetorv in the historic centre, November 2008Aarhus Cathedral (''Århus Domkirke'') in the centre of Aarhus, is the longest and tallest church in Denmark at  and  in length and height respectively. Originally built as a Romanesque basilica in the 13thcentury, it was rebuilt and enlarged as a Gothic cathedral in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Even though the cathedral stood finished around 1300, it took more than a century to build; the associated cathedral school of ''Aarhus Katedralskole'' was already founded in 1195 and ranks as the 44th oldest school in the world. Another important and historic church in the inner city, is the Church of our Lady (''Vor Frue Kirke'') also from the 13thcentury in Romanesque and Gothic style. It is smaller and less impressive, but it was the first cathedral of Aarhus and founded on an even older church constructed in 1060; the oldest stone church in Scandinavia. Parts of this former church were excavated in the 1950s and can now be experienced as a crypt beneath the nave of ''Vor Frue Kirke''.

Aarhusian, as most local dialects in Denmark, has diminished in use through the 20th century and most people today speak some version of Standard Danish with regional features although it still has a strong presence in older segments of the population and in areas with high numbers of immigrants.Common or traditional Aarhusian words are: træls (tiresome), noller (silly or dumb) and dælme (Excl. damn me). The dialect is notable for single syllable words ending in "d" being pronounced with stød while the same letter in multiple syllable words is pronounced as "j", i.e.. Odder is pronounced "Ojjer". Like other dialects in East Jutland it has two grammatical genders, similar to Standard Danish, but different from West Jutlandic dialects which have only one.In 2009 the University of Aarhus compiled a list of contemporary public figures, who best exemplify the dialect, including Jacob Haugaard, Thomas Helmig, Steffen Brandt, Stig Tøfting, Flemming Jørgensen, Tina Dickow and Camilla Martin. In popular culture the dialect features prominently in Niels Malmros' movie ''Aarhus By Night'' and 90s comedy sketches by Jacob Haugaard and Finn Nørbygaard.Sports{| class="wikitable"|-!Club!Sport!League!Venue (capacity)!Founded!Titles!Attendance|-| style="white-space:nowrap;" | Aarhus Gymnastik Forening| style="white-space:nowrap;" | Soccer| style="white-space:nowrap;" align=center | Superliga| style="white-space:nowrap;" | Ceres Park (20,032)| align=center | 1880| align=center | 5| align=center | 23,990|-| Aarhus GF Håndbold| Handball| style="white-space:nowrap;" align=center | Danish Handball League| NRGi Arena (4,700)| align=center | 2001| align=center | 9In 2001 A.G.F., Aarhus KFUM, VRI and Brabrand IF merged to form Aarhus GF Håndbold.
