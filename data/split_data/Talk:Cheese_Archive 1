American consumptionSomeone please change the most consumed American cheese to read "fior di latte" and not mozzarella. Mozzarella is made with buffalo's milk, the one consumed by Americans is made by cow's milk, and is thus fior di latte. this is a common mistake and technically erroneous, so please change.  â€”The preceding unsigned comment was added by Special:Contributions/129.133.143.171|129.133.143.171 (talk) 10:12, 6 December 2006 (UTC).;;;Yes, that is the proper name of what Americans eat, but not what they call it -- they do call it "mozzarella". 69.87.199.176 00:42, 24 December 2006 (UTC)"mozzarella di bufala campana made only from Campania's buffalo milk; mozzarella fior di latte made from cow's milk" See? IT's still called mozarella -- 13:31, 25 December 2006 193.108.134.112I think Italians generally refer to the cow milk version as just plain Fior di latte (written also as fiordilatte) -- but only a native speaker could say for sure. 69.87.194.147 15:00, 25 December 2006 (UTC)DisambiguationEr, please, this is a prime area where some disambiguation is going to be required. If you are creating a link to Cheddar this is going to point to the town of Cheddar which is quite historically significant, home to the Cheddar caves, the interesting pre-Roman Cheddar Man, the bike-race which is the Cheddar Challenge, etc, etc, if you follow my drift... Cheddar cheese should really be referenced as Cheddar cheese. Then all that is required is a simple link in Cheddar itself. This applies to all cheese names where the cheese has a place name. This will become even more of an issue with the new improved PHP version of Wiki where disambiguation can be qualified by e.g. bracketing. sjcAccording to the naming conventions, we should use the most common form of a word, for linking purposes etc.  So adding the word cheese to every kind of cheese violates this convention.  When I want to write about brie, I will call it brie and not brie cheese, for example.  So the page about brie should be at Brie.  Disambiguating can be done later, only as the need arises. I'll wait to change the links in case anyone wants to argue the point. - TimThere may be situations when you will need to include the word cheese, for example when referring to Swiss Cheese.  Though more specific names for it may exist, they are not as well known and would not be as obvious to many readers.  For the most part, however, it should be beside the point, as individual cheeses ought to eventually have their own articles. -- phreyanSpellingsI've changed some spellings here which appeared to be phonetic guesses. I'm not sure I've picked them all up. I'm guessing 'Savoy aire' is really 'Savoyard' but I don't know that one so haven't changed it. - Gritchka Also, under British (now that they're grouped by nationality), I can name more cheeses but I have no idea whether they're cheddar-family (a concept new to me).NationalitySpent some time reorganizing the list by nationality of origin.  Note that this is ambiguous for some cheeses.  I also added the word "cheese" to the end of each subject, though I know some people object.  As most European cheeses are named after a town of origin, even "Brie" needs to be disambiguated.  There are a couple of exceptions, though, and I suppose people will change them as they see fit (some might see 'Queso Blanco cheese' as a bit redundant, I suppose...)  Also, I couldn't find any references on Google to a couple of the cheeses, so they're not categorized.  I hope someone can determine where these cheeses came from. -DMonty PythonRemoved the following, because it didn't seem appropriate for the article:"There is also a Monty_Python cheese store skit (which includes imaginary cheeses such as Cheese/Venezuelan Beaver Cheese|Venezuelan Beaver Cheese).

Such as in various east Asian cultures, where cheese is considered gross because it is seen only as rotted milk, and repulsive because it is considered bad-smelling (compare durian).  I got the impression that such cultures have few native milk culturing traditions, and have not developed a collective acquired taste for cheese of any kind. - Gilgamesh 13:18, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC):Err... Any statistical evidence for this? My experience has been contrary, as my Korean aunt and many other East Asian people I know ''love'' cheese. Of course, this just proves that anecdotal evidence is useless, which is why I asked for statistics. =P I should also point out that people of African and East Asian descent tend to lack the necessary number of lactase enzymes for processing cheese and other dairy products, so it might not be a matter of dislike as much as simple avoidance.--John 01:21, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)What about southern asian counties, specifically India.  I don't know specifics, but since the cow is considered sacred in all forms, wouldn't cheese be an abomination[...your kidding me]?-ORBIT Dec 5, 2004The Indian culture sees cows as sacred more because of the population density and the necessity to keep cows alive such that they provide milk.  A popular form of cheese in India is paneer, but beyond that they do not have many varieties.  Paneer is usually made with spinach to make the dish Saag Paneer that is popular at indian restaurants.Milk and dairy have been central features of the diet in West, Southwest, South and Central Asia but NOT in East and Southeast Asia. The dividing line between milk/dairy and non-milk/dairy cultures is roughly that between Bangladesh and Myanmar (Burma). Although in the 20th century, many Southeast and East Asian cultures have adopted milk and cheese, there's all kinds of readily observeable evidence that this is something relatively new. In Korea, many people born before 1960 still consider milk, ice cream and cheese to be indigestible...for the simple reason that for them it IS indigestible. The same holds true more generally for the region from Korea, through the SE Asian archipelago, on to the border with the South Asian cultural region.Looking at any cookbook, or better yet a culinary history of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Filipino, Thai, Khmer, Malay and Myanmar cuisine will show that milk/dairy played little or no role in their food systems. Asking people from these cultures about what older family and friends say about dairy will also give evidence that milk and, especially, fermented cheese are NOT considered foods, properly speaking. Some East Asians will consider milk a medicine and will use it for the laxitive or purgative properties it has **for them**.As mentioned elsewhere here, the ability to digest lactose is not universal. In many places, people have insufficient enzymes to digest milk, except in the smallest servings. Many people, if they do not drink cow's milk continuously from weaning, lose the ability to digest lactose-rich products. Since many Southeast and East Asian people now drink cow's milk from infancy, the percentage of those who are able to digest milk/dairy and, therefore, consider it a food, is increasing.In South Asia, broadly, the principal form of milk/dairy has been that from bovines: cows and buffaloes. Pakistan and Afghanistan mark, more or less, the frontier where bovine products yield to ovine (sheep) and caprine (goat) milk/dairy products. Central Asia also has groups which have favored equine (horse) milk/dairy products. Tibetans have used yak (probably a bovine?) products.More broadly, fermented products seem, in my experience, to be one of the food groups that most resists translation. No doubt this is because fermenting is, in fact, a kind of rotting. For a product with which we're familiar, we can recognize the difference between spoilage (bad rotting, which changes food into garbage) and fermenting (good rotting, which changes raw food into prepared delicacies). Japanese nato (soy beans), Filipino patis (fish sauce), European cheese (milk), Korean kimchi (cabbage), Greek olives, Central Asian koumis (mare's milk) are just some of the fermented products that often produce a yuck-reaction for those from other cultures.:Well, speaking for Japan, agricultural, economical, and religious problems made cheese "extinct" from its cuisine. Records from Nara and Heian period, roughly over 1300 years ago, show that various cow and horse milk products including cheese were available and consumed. But these products were consumed as a type of medication. These products were available only in a very limited amount because there simply wasn't enough land available in Japan to raising cattles to eat. If the same amount of land was used to raise rice instead of cattle, it would support far more people. Of course lands unsuitable for growing rice would be used for other crops or cattles but such place, namely Hokkaido, didn't become a part of Japan until 17th century. Japanese basically couldn't raise enough cattle so milk and related products didn't become popular. Also, Buddhism which spread around the same time was against killing of animals and the consumption of meat in general. So Japanese simply kept enough cows and horses for farming and decided to eat rice, vegetables, and fish. After all, it's not like that you have to eat cheese.:Situations changed in 19th century but it's kind of hard for food that wasn't available for a millenium to become popular. The fact that milk and cheese were expensive didn't help. Anyway, to make the story short, from late 1940s, milk became the only type of drink available in school lunch during the compulsory education and that's what made milk and cheese accepted. Hokkaido started churning out milk in enough volume aided by improvement in roads and Seikan Tunnel. Japanese also became rich enough to be able to buy cheese from anywhere they want.:In fact Japanese know cheese enough that it can be used as a political ploy. In a latest news , this says that a Japanese politician, Mori, "insulted" rock-hard cheese. The news doesn't say this because it makes him look smart, but this exchange was actually a "cheesy" show. He knew that this cheese was a tasty one and used this to say "Look, pass this law or Koizumi is going to call a snap-election. I know it's hard to swallow but it will be good for everyone." Media took his words of "unhospitability" and run the story that way prompting a campaign by Koizumi's opponents to crush the law because they took it as a sign that Koizumi's position was weak. While media and opposing politicians were fooled, many on 2ch were saying that Mori was using cheese to make a point and that this whole "pursuading" rant was a joke. Oh, and he did came out on TV last week that he was acting on that day infront of camera with beer and cheese in his hand.  Maybe this should be part of this article as a ingenious way of "cheesy talk". ;) - Revth 06:32, 5 September 2005 (UTC)This is good information to learn about, and should be in the article.  And what about modern China and southeast Asia?

If the second sentence is accurate, what exactly does the first sentence mean?:It means, even though kosher animal-based rennet is a "meat product", you can still eat the cheese itself - it is not considered a prohibited mix of meat and dairy, basically, I think, on a technicality that says that rennet is a meat product but not a "food."

Bunchofgrapes  (talk) 15:42, 7 October 2005 (UTC)Addictive propertiesNot many people may know that cheese, like chocolate, has certain specific addictive properties.  Casomorphin is the chemical in cheese that is responsible for this and it has opiate like effect.  I'm not if this has a direct opiate effect or if it needs to be broken down into other substances first, but some quick research can clear this up. Nathan J. Yoder 09:39, 29 October 2005 (UTC):It's hard to make a case that cheese (or chocolate, for that matter) actually is psychoactive to a degree that could cause an opiate effect or addiction. I've seen the chocolate myth debunked elsewhere (I think McGee's On Food and Cooking explores it some, eventually concluding that people get addicted to chocolate because ;mdash; ! ;mdash; it tastes really good) but this is the first I've heard of it for cheese. Most sites making any sort of opiate claim are fringe anti-milk advocacy sites. This page  cites some scientific studies largely debunking casomorphin claims. Of course, nutritional science is a moving target, and it could turn out there are real effects from these chemicals, but until data to that effect makes it into some more mainstream sources, I don't believe the information is neccessarily appropriate in the article. ;mdash;Bunchofgrapes  (talk) 19:48, 31 October 2005 (UTC)That's interesting, I had not read the studies on it, I was just going based on what some doctor interviewed for Super Size Me had said.

It mentions chocolate cheese capturing '10 percent of the cheese market in Taiwan within 6 months of its release.' which to me seems mildly notable (though I could definitely be wrong since I don't know much about cheese or its markets). I just brought this up because I'm interested in it and would like to learn more. :) --ImmortalGoddezz 05:20, 21 June 2006 (UTC):::That linked article is almost certainly enough to justify starting a chocolate cheese article, or similar. Probably not enough to merit a specific mention on this overview page, though, hard to say... there are a lot of flavored cheeses in the world ([PrÃ¤stost] is often cured in whisky for example) and they can't all be mentioned. ;mdash;Bunchofgrapes  (talk) 14:59, 21 June 2006 (UTC)Cheeze redirectWhat is the use of the Cheeze redirect? I thought we weren't supposed to have redirects from misspellings. Is cheeze some British variant or some nonsense?--Josh Rocchio 15:48, 13 July 2006 (UTC):Maybe we should redirect it to Cheez Whiz instead? Redirects are cheap and we don't tend to worry too much about excessive or borderline questionable ones. ;mdash;Bunchofgrapes  (talk) 15:57, 13 July 2006 (UTC)::Or Velveeta =]? Cheeze whiz seems more appropriate.--Josh Rocchio 04:22, 14 July 2006 (UTC)origin of the English name (caseus)One of the first things I wanted to know was whence the name, but it appears way down the page.  I don't want to edit as I'm not a wiki 'foodie' but could there perhaps be summary info at the top of the article incl. eg origin of the name.  I assume there'd have to be a common format for all the food articles though... Hakluyt bean 20:31, 19 July 2006 (UTC):Not really much of a common format; in some other featured food articles the etymology is in fact handled in the lead. There are two problems with doing that here though -- the lead is already too long, and the "in language" section is quite a bit more extensive than other food article's similar sections. Ideally what I'd like to see would be::*the current last para of the lead moving into a more complete "cooking with and eating cheese" section elsewhere in the article, and:*a summary of the etymology placed into the now-shorter lead::;mdash;Bunchofgrapes  (talk) 20:43, 19 July 2006 (UTC)I think that would be great.  The first half of the cheese in language section is pretty good.  A hint of it at the beginning might do it justice. Hakluyt bean 20:16, 20 July 2006 (UTC):Done. Whew. I'm sure the new bits could use some copyediting, hint hint. ;mdash;Bunchofgrapes  (talk) 03:57, 25 July 2006 (UTC)::I've only noticed this quite late, but I still want to say that I think it wasn't a very good idea to move the etymology of the word to the introduction/summary. The etymology is enough of a subject to have its own heading. The summary was great before, even though the expansion of the heading about cooking with cheese wasn't a bad idea. I think the tymology should get its heading back. --Nin 05:17, 15 September 2006 (UTC) (''I am probably not returning to this talk page; I just left my opinion on this subject.''):::The etymology section is still there, in full. The lead has only a brief summary. ;mdash;Bunchofgrapes  (talk) 18:01, 15 September 2006 (UTC)Inherent BiasThis article is written from a completely non-neutral perspective.

What viewpoints are under-represented? ;mdash;Bunchofgrapes  (talk) 23:33, 5 August 2006 (UTC):Cheese under Nazi Germany, for one. There's no mention of that anywhere in this article.::OK. Go away. ;mdash;Bunchofgrapes  (talk) 14:53, 9 August 2006 (UTC)Casu marzuWhy is there no mention of Casu marzu cheese? For those that don't know what it is, it is a form of Pecorino Sardo filled with maggots. By the way, those thinking of commenting it's fictional nature should save time and not do it because it is in-fact real. - 02:32, 11 August 2006 (UTC)~~:Casu marzu is certainly real. Having written most of the cheese article and most of the Casu marzu article myself, it was my judgement that there was no benefit (outside possible shock value) to linking to such a little-known (on a global scale) cheese from this overview article. Filling the article with mentions of "interesting" rather than representative cheeses would turn it into a list of trivia. ;mdash;Bunchofgrapes  (talk) 19:43, 11 August 2006 (UTC)OK. - 20:39, 11 August 2006 (UTC)CategorizationThe categorization of cheese in the article seems to me right now very limited, and parochial (as it just sticks to the common american categorization of cheese). I just tried to point out the main principles of classification that are used, alone or mixed, in the world, to categorize cheese. The French one, for instance, is complex and is a mix of three of these basic types   (official web site of french milk producers union) : 1) soft dough with washed rind (Munster, e.g); 2) soft dough with mold rind (camembert, for instance); 3) pressed and unheated dough (Cheddar, Cantal); 4) pressed and heated dough (Emmental, Beaufort,what is called in the US "swiss like" cheeses), 5) mold dough (pÃ¢te persillÃ©e) (Roquefort, "blue" cheeses); 6) fresh cheese; 7) goat's milk cheese and 8) processed cheese. This classification is close to official. What is more, 3) and 4) kind of cheese are commonly classified according to their affinage (old Cantal vs young Cantal). A classification of this kind is sometimes used in Italy . I find this categorization extremely accurate, as it is based mainly on the basic methods of cheese making. But I'm certainly biased !The categorization that I proposed tries not to be parochial, and to sum up this great diversity of classifications. It really goes to the basic principles of the categorizations used. You can find it on these (italian) sites , .Gedefr 20:21, 26 August 2006 (UTC):My edit was really just a copyedit of yours -- spelling, grammar, syntax -- and fiddling with the headers, which don't make sense they way you have them right now. I am at a loss as to why you reverted it. Other than the headers, I tried not to change what you were saying at all. Did I fail? I have no opinion as to how best to categorize cheeses; I don't think there is any one correct way, but I was trying to adhere to those commonly  seen in English-language sources. ;mdash;Bunchofgrapes  (talk) 22:16, 26 August 2006 (UTC)My mistake. I overlooked your copyedit.Gedefr 22:32, 26 August 2006 (UTC): when squirrels attack 69.246.70.243 00:21, 28 September 2006 (UTC)Export table valuesFrance exported $2,658,441 of cheese in 2004? Im not a cheese expert, nor do I care to be, but I know that that figure is wrong. Surely it must be in 000's of $, not $.:So you contend that France exported 2 billion dollars in cheese instead of 2 million?  And why don't you want to be a cheese expert?

Syrthiss 11:49, 29 September 2006 (UTC)Nope, im just a bum who finds wildly innacurate statistics annoying.VandalismWhy in the world is this article locked against changes by the newbies (I am not one, if it matters).  I mean, locks are usually placed on articles succeptable to vandalism and extreme points of view like abortion and race.  Is there a secret group of cheese-haters out there somewhere?  If so, I've never met any. (Yumm!) Sys Hax 09:05, 19 December 2006 (UTC)*If you look at the recent edits, User:Aaabbbcccdddeeefffggg has been vandalising the article by replacing it with statements like "Cheese is edible, but it tastes like yellow poop!!!!!!!!!". Presumably, the article has been locked for this reason. Mouse Nightshirt 13:29, 19 December 2006 (UTC)**95 % of the edits on this article are related to vandalism. There's certainly no group of cheese-haters out there, but a bunch of guys who find funny to constantly destroy this article . Why they find that funny is a complete mystery to me. Gedefr 14:54, 19 December 2006 (UTC)::Cheese is apparently as inherently funny a word or concept as duck, banana, or kumquat.

This sentence has a spelling mistake, and needs to be re-written in plainer English. 69.87.204.169 02:43, 2 January 2007 (UTC):These vaguely referenced "studies" should also be cited or perhaps removed altogether.  This phrase was added Nov 19 2006 around 06:26 by Lode. Sbonds 07:25, 5 January 2007 (UTC)Celebrity CheesemakersI have now twice reverted the addition of a section called "Celebrity cheesemakers", which states that "Blur bassist Alex James has recently confirmed [8] that he has been focusing on cheese making ahead of a possible band reunion." I do not believe this nugget of trivia rises anywhere near the level of wanting to be included in this article. Thoughts? ;mdash;Bunchofgrapes  (talk) 16:02, 9 January 2007 (UTC)-- I believe that the addition of this section represents a valid and necessary infusion of popular culture into the much-maligned art of cheese-making. The deliberate exclusion of this information, whilst undoubtedly well-intentioned, could equally be construed as an attempt to downplay this popular hobby and keep it sidelined and regarded as a fringe activity. Cheese-making is undergoing something of a rennaissance in recent years, and to ignore this growing trend is to undermine one of the core values of Wikipedia: its ability quickly to respond to ever-changing nuances of meaning and culture. As a supporter of the British Cheese Board, I find the interest of an iconic British celebrity figure such as Alex James to be a breath of fresh air in what can, at time, be a staid and misunderstood world. I implore you: please reinstate this entry so that young potential cheesemakers can see that cheesemaking can indeed be both 'cool' and fantastically engrossing. Adam Channell 208.1.253.163 12:59, 29 January 2007 (UTC)Interesting... Inever heard of celebrity cheesemakers, so maybe we SHOULD add it on here... so others can learn about them
