please fixConstantinople fell to the Turkish Ottoman Empire in 1453. The name of the city was changed to Istanbul in 1930 following the establishment of modern Turkey.This is a wrong statement. How is it that the city of Constantinople stayed until 1930? What was it called till 1930 if it fell in 1453?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/99.254.17.206|99.254.17.206 (talk) 15:19, 5 March 2009 (UTC);; ;;Please fix this raised issue of when the name Istanbul was first used (obviously earlier than 1930).

Byzantium was an ooooold colony, and had never been of any particular importance.  It took bureaucracy to populate it and imperial commands to make aristocrats live there!  --MichaelTinklerWikipedia and ByzantiumThis is a perfectly reasonable 200 word entry and maybe all I should expect from Wikipedia.  But Jeez -- the Empire lasted 1100 years!  Is it unreasonable to expect a little more depth from this medium??Er...did you look at the article on the Byzantine Empire?  This article is just about the city of Istanbul during the period when it was called Byzantium.  At any rate, yes, it is unreasonable to expect that any given Wikipedia article will be particularly good.  Those of us who work on wikipedia are working hard to improve it, but it takes a lot of work, and none of us are paid to do this.  So while there are some articles that are great, there are others that are quite mediocre.

In the article on the Flag of the Ottoman Empire the star wasn't introduced until the 1844. Anyone who knows which is right should probably address this!'''{unsigned}'''I think worse that this is the very story. It is my understanding that the crescent was a Muslim symbol long before the Turks conquered Constantinople. In fact, I have often heard a story wherein upon the conqering of Constantinople the cross atop the Hagia Sophia was replaced with a crescent (as can still be seen) as part of its conversion from a church to a mosque. Unless I see opposition, I am going to edit the section. Israelite9191 08:08, 7 January 2007 (UTC)I checked wıth an Orthodox Bıshop and he saıd the entıre entry ıs a fraud.

The first one speaks of the city built between two "byzia" (literally meaning boobs) i.e. "wealty regions" Europe and Asia and it was called Byzantium because it was in the middle of two continents. The second one speaks of a Delphi omen saying to Vyzas "built your city close to the city of the blind". Vyzas searched for the "city of the blind", but there was no such city. When he saw the place where Byzantium was to be built he liked so much, that when he saw a city built in Asia accross the Byzantium location (Scoutari or Chrysoupoli) he said to the colonists that they should built their city there cause the "city of the blind" was in Asia already built by "blind" people unable to see the beauty of Byzantium's location.MergingThe reason is actually obvious, if you check the Istanbul article, there are sections about Constantinople and Byzantium. The Constantinople and Byzantium articles  would fit there quite well. Furthermore, these articles contains material common to Byzantine Empire (even Roman Empire). By merging the articles we would have a chance to avoid to represent the same staff in different places. E104421 17:00, 27 October 2006 (UTC):Since the character of the city has changed so dramatically over time, I think it would be better to keep individual pages for Byzantium, Constantinople, and Istanbul. Tom Harrison Talk 20:02, 27 October 2006 (UTC)::These articles should not be merged. For one, the article would be too long and would need to be split again on size grounds. For another, when a reader searches on  "Byzantium" or "Constantinople" they don't expect to read about Istanbul the modern city - these are distinct phases (Pagan, Christian, Muslim) with distinct histories and context. Lastly, E104421's concern about duplication is actually a feature of Wikipedia. We have ''Main article'' tags that direct readers to the main article, with a short summary paragraph. This is commonly done throughout Wikipedia and works well - in best practice the short summary paragraph would be a cut-paste of the main articles Wikipedia:Lead section. This is discussed in the Manual of Style. -- Stbalbach 13:18, 28 October 2006 (UTC):::Ok, then, i'm removing the tag. E104421 10:11, 29 October 2006 (UTC)You only want to merge the articles for your personal reasons; let's say fewer articles indicating the Greek history of Istanbul going back to antiquity. Even if such a ridiculous POV-push did take place, it wouldn't last. The article Constantinople has had enough POV-pushing by Turkish editors already, such as the official usage of the term Constantinople only until 1453 (instead, say, 1930). So let's just leave it at that. Miskin 15:04, 29 October 2006 (UTC):Hey, i already explained my reasons above, do not mix/compare other's edits with mine. I'm only responsible with my own edits.

E104421 15:35, 29 October 2006 (UTC)HerodotusAccording to Herodotus 4.144, it was Megabazus who made the comment that the people of Chalcedon were blind, upon a visit to Byzantion...?Emblem'''Byzantium was the first state to make the crescent moon and star its state symbol and emblem'''. The day Byzantium fell, those were the flags the turks saw flying above the city before they went inside.  There are some Turkic nationals trying to lesser this by attempting to find as many cultures as possible who used any combination of moon/moons - crescent moon/moons ect and 1 -12 stars with Gods on top ect. By doing this they hope to leave open the theory that maybe a turk saw this emblem in some other land on their travels before Byzantium and that is why it is in their flag. IE to negate the Greek origins. Fair enough. But under the British flag article or the french flag article, there is no long-winded explanation on everyone or anyone ever to use lines in a flag or the color blue. That is because it is irrelevant. If another culture ever used the crescent moon and star together as a symbol of state at anytime, we must add it. It must be known. However Byzantium was the only one to use that exact and striking combination. There is no need other than turkish nationalism to list the millions of cultures who may or may not have had stars or moons in a carving on some wall at one time or another.

''Byzantium'' is the obvious and best known natural title of, and obvious natural search term most people would use when looking for the content currently placed under Byzantine Empire. It is quite disconcerting to arrive at this page instead, particularly as there is no disambiguating notice at the top of the page, just a link to the disambiguation page. Ideally, Byzantine Empire would appear here under its most-used, most obvious title and the place (as discussed on this page) appear under something like Byzanyium (place). But if that is thought awkward, then there should certainly be a prominent notice placed at the top of the page, linking obviously and directly to the desired content. Notice that a Google search for "Byzantium" leads directly here, not to Byzantine Empire, which is what (probably) 98% of visitors would be looking for. Tannin (talk) 12:20, 31 March 2014 (UTC)
