Article titleI've reverted the move by User:SilkTork to change this article name to "The blues", which in my view is a major step which requires discussion and community consensus here first.  I'm not ''necessarily'' against the move, but am ''strongly'' in favour of the need for it to be discussed here first.  Having said that, I'm personally going to be off-site for a couple of days, and look forward to joining the debate on my return.  Ghmyrtle (talk) 17:29, 31 December 2010 (UTC):I've restored to the correct use of the term as the reason given for reverting is not neccessary. See Wikipedia:Don't revert due to "no consensus", and also Wikipedia:Reverting.  is the form that appears to be widely used when discussing the blues. I did a little research before making the move, and I also checked back in the archives to see if this had previously been discussed. It looks to me as though "blues" has been used as the title incorrectly, and others reading the article have simply assumed that the person naming it "blues" did so because there was a valid reason which they didn't know about. If there are valid reasons for calling it "blues" then it would be worth presenting them so a discussion can take place.

User:Nancy|NancyUser talk:Nancy| talk 10:43, 3 January 2011 (UTC)----The blues →  — So far as I am aware, this page has been located at "Blues" since it was created in 2001, until the last few days.  Again, so far as I am aware, there has been no dispute, objection or discussion about that title.  However, on 31 December, User:SilkTork moved the article, without any prior discussion, to "The blues", in .  After I reverted , the article was moved back to "The blues" .The current article title "The blues" is unjustified on several counts.  Firstly, the title "Blues" is long-established and has been uncontested.  WP:TITLECHANGES states: ''"If an article title has been stable for a long time, and there is no good reason to change it, it should not be changed."''  Secondly, the title "The blues" contravenes WP:TITLE in several respects.  It is not the term ''"that readers are most likely to look for in order to find the article"''.  It is not concise.  Guidance at WP:DEFINITE states: ''"Avoid definite and indefinite articles: Do not place definite or indefinite articles (the, a and an) at the beginning of titles unless they are part of a proper name...or will otherwise change the meaning..."'' - neither of which applies.  In terms of general usage, although the term "The blues" (or "The Blues") is a widely used term, there is no evidence at all that it is any more widely used than the term "Blues" (or, for example, "Blues music").  For all these reasons, the article should have its long-established title, "Blues", reinstated.

I wasn't able to take part and give my views. Rationale for naming the article '''Blues music'''.* appears to be the standard form for naming and discussing this topic. A blues singer would say "I sing the blues" rather than "I sing blues". The definite article is dropped when it is replaced by a descriptor, such as "Chicago" blues, or by the indefinite article, such as "a" blues singer. When linked to "music", it becomes "blues music", and is acceptable in that form. However the form "blues" does not often appear by itself. The form "the blues" falls into the same category as The Crown, which is indicated in WP:NOUN. I came to this article because of an awkward link construction on another article where someone had written "the blues". However, because WP:NOUN frowns upon the use of the definite article, and there is uncertainty about using it in this article an alternative is Blues music. Blues music would be more descriptive, and avoid the possible conflict over the Wikipedia reluctance to use the definite article. We already have Rock music, Pop music, Soul music, Swing music, Folk music, etc. There are examples of music form articles which do stand alone, such as Jazz and Reggae, though with these examples there is no risk of confusion or conflict. I will notify significant contributors and WikiProjects of this discussion, and request that it is not closed for at least seven days, to allow a consensus to be built up. '''User:SilkTork|SilkTork;/font;''' *User talk:SilkTork|YES! 12:51, 3 January 2011 (UTC)*'''Oppose''' move. Firstly, "(the) blues" is much more common than "blues music" and this article is the clear primary topic for "blues". The situation is different from, for example, "rock music" because rock music is not considered to be the primary topic for rock (which is a disambiguation page) and has to be disambiguated from the other meanings somehow anyway. Secondly, WP:THE specifies that we only start a page title with the definite article if the article is habitually capitalized in running text. This is not the case here, which is why we use blues and not the blues. Jafeluv (talk) 13:11, 3 January 2011 (UTC)*'''Oppose'''; proposed title is overly precise.  Powers T;;13:34, 3 January 2011 (UTC)*'''Neutral''' on "Blues" vs. "Blues music", as either could work ok and I'm not averse to consistency of naming with other styles of music. Since the above rationale includes a lot about "Blues" vs "The blues", I'll also say I '''oppose''' the version with the unnecessary definite article (and would also regard the "I play blues" sentence as perfectly normal). AllyD (talk) 16:23, 3 January 2011 (UTC)*'''Support''', or move to Blues (music).

"Blues" is a well used term, which can imply being depressed, or a sports team who wear blue, or a number of other things. At one time it was a common name for downers, and some animals and insects are referred to as blues. So a Google search just for "blues" would be including a bunch of things that are not "blues music". It's likely the 46,000,000 extra results for "blues" over "blues music" would be the other things.

The titles you list are all disambiguated because the music genre has not been determined as the primary topic of rock, pop, soul, swing and folk. If the proposal is to keep blues redirecting to this page as well, it makes no sense to use a disambiguated title. That is, unless you're saying that the music genre is ''more commonly'' referred to as "blues music" than just blues. Note also how jazz, reggae, rhythm and blues, gospel etc. use non-disambiguated titles. Jafeluv (talk) 20:25, 3 January 2011 (UTC)*'''Oppose''' blues is definitely the most common use of the word. The above examples have music in the title because they have other definitions outside of music. Blues is rarely used outside of music. Most people would look up "Sad" or "Sadness" if they wanted the other definition. JDDJS (talk) 20:16, 3 January 2011 (UTC)*'''Weak oppose'''. If I had to choose one choice, I would probably choose what is being served currently. I probably wouldn't mind if it changed to "blues music", but I like it simply as "blues" because it is more commonly used than "blues music". User:Backtable|Backtable ;/font;User talk:Backtable|Speak to me;/font;Special:Contributions/Backtable|concerning my deeds.;/font; 00:33, 4 January 2011 (UTC)*'''Oppose'''.  "Blues" (without definite article) is a very widely and commonly used term, and there is no good reason to depart from established practice and guidance here.  If there were very strong reasons, I would not necessarily oppose either "Blues music" or "Blues (music)" - but none of the arguments made so far have convinced me that such a move is either necessary or helpful.  I remain opposed to naming the article "The blues" for reasons already stated.  I also agree with the points made by User:Jafeluv, in particular.  Ghmyrtle (talk) 09:06, 4 January 2011 (UTC)*'''Oppose'''. I see both sides of this one, remembering that the first time I tried to find the blues on Wikipedia I included the definite article. However, a search on google books reveals that there are a very large number of important titles that simply use the form "blues". Therefore I think the move is unecessary. If a move were demonstrated to be necessary I would probably prefer "the blues" to "blues music", but both would be accurate and I could see myself joining a consensus around them.--'''User:Sabrebd|SabreBD (User talk:Sabrebd|talk) 09:20, 4 January 2011 (UTC)*'''Oppose'''. It's like "Rock and roll". You'd sure hear some calling it "Rock and roll music", but the common usage is "Rock and roll". Same as "Blues". Common usage is "Blues". No need to change the title. ~ Elitropia (talk) 09:48, 4 January 2011 (UTC)*'''Oppose'''. When musicians say "I have the blues" it means "I have the blue devils on my mind", i.e. "I am sad".  That's why blues usually appears with the "the" in front of it.  I also support the idea that Blues music or Blues (music) is too specific.  I think evereybody understand that the first meaning of blues is a music genre and not a plural form. Vb (talk) 18:51, 6 January 2011 (UTC)*'''Oppose'''. "Blues" is just fine.  When people see "blues," they automatically think music -- not colors, or mood, or anything else.  "Blues music" reads as a redundancy.  A disambiguation page will solve any problem with perceived lack of specificity for those few who may be confused.  Further, when Black folk talk about "singing the blues," they're talking about being down -- not actually ''singing'' the blues.  When B.B. King sings "Why I sing the blues," that's rather a lyrical accommodation to meter, rather than the way Black folks talk.  If I'm referring to a blues artist, I'll say, "He/She sings blues" -- not "''the'' blues."  Or, I'll say, "He called me, singin' the blues about his supervisor bein' on his back all the time."  He's not actually ''singing''; he's complaining, or sad/down-in-the-mouth ABOUT something. It strikes me that this discussion is somewhat ethnically skewed as well; that is, people are responding based on their own culturally mediated experiences -- as am I, to a certain extent.  I mean Brit David Bowie's song about "danc[ing] the blues"?  The lyrics are just jarringly strange to me.  ''No one'' Black talks of "dancing the blues" -- and I'm not sure many native-born U.S. citizens of any ethnicity do either. deeceevoice (talk) 16:18, 11 January 2011 (UTC):''The above discussion is preserved as an archive of a requested move.

Ghmyrtle (talk) 16:21, 5 April 2014 (UTC)New LeadUser OnBeyondZebrax changed the lead paragraph to a very long one with plenty of details which I think are not relevant to the common reader.  For instance "The first publication of blues sheet music was in 1908: Antonio Maggio's "I Got the Blues" is the first published song to use the word blues." is not an information which is worth telling at this place.  The same is IMHO true for "There are few characteristics common to all blues music, because the genre took its shape from the idiosyncrasies of individual performances."  I think such a major change to the article should be discussed here before being implemented. I shall reverse those changes in a near future if no opposite opinion were to be expressed.
