Akseli9 (talk) 12:16, 1 May 2013 (UTC)Merge with UltraviolenceConcerning the Ultraviolence article which was considered for deletion, the consensus was to merge with this article. Although I was the creator of the Ultraviolence article, I'm certainly not an expert in A clockwork Orange, so I don't consider myself the best one to perform the merge. Here's the article's main part which I think should (somehow) be merged here (sorry if this is unnecessary, but I don't know how merging articles works):---'''Ultraviolence''' is a term used roughly to describe acts of excessive and/or unjustified violence. The term was coined by Anthony Burgess in his novel ''A Clockwork Orange'', where the main character Alex DeLarge and his gang of "droogs" roam the streets committing violent crimes out of enjoyment, including rape and murder, referred to as "''do[ing] the ultra-violent''".This sense of aesthetic violence has led to the term's usage in media, i.e. criticism regarding the representation of violence as enjoyable spectacle. The term "ultraviolence" has been applied to several works of entertainment such as the ''Saw'' series, Hostel, ''GANTZ'', and the Manhunt game series.and some links from the external links section I consider relevant for the term and the book:*[Clockwork Orange and the Aestheticization of Violence]*[UltraViolent Atrocities Saturate Pop Culture]Kreachure (talk) 16:27, 21 January 2008 (UTC)"He is also unable to listen to any classical composition without experiencing the same jarring physical reaction."Is this right?

User:Wakuran|惑乱 Wakuran (talk) 15:18, 6 May 2009 (UTC)Umm, "the final chapter"?In the final chapter, Alex finds himself half-heartedly preparing for yet another night of crime with a new trio of droogs. After a chance encounter with Pete, who has reformed and married, Alex finds himself taking less and less pleasure in acts of senseless violence. He begins contemplating giving up crime himself to become a productive member of society and start a family of his own, while reflecting on the notion that his own children will be just as destructive-- if not more so-- than he himself.;/blockquote;Really?  I just finished my copy (Ballantine Books First Edition, Thirty First Printing - November 1987) and this definitely isn't in the book.  The final chapter ends with Alex in the hospital listening to Beethoven's Ninth.  Then an afterword by Stanley Edgar Hyman, a Nadsat glossary, and... that's it.

Alex does, indeed, justify his behavior, in a Nietzschean manner -- that, as he is not an intellectual "sheep" and is consciously self-aware, he is therefore free to do whatever he likes, because he is doing it ''of his own free will''. This butts up against an essay he finds in the house of one of his victims, titled "A Clockwork Orange", in which the writer talks about something that seems to be organic and alive, but is actually a deterministic mechanism. Alex gets the point, and tears up the essay in anger. Naturally, none of this appears in Kubrick's wretchedly perverse film.

If they were regularly fighting each other in '62, the media don't seem to have noticed it. It also seems that the term Rocker (subculture) postdated the battles of '64, and '62 seems a bit early for mods beyond the modernist/trad jazz argument.

Akseli9 (talk) 11:51, 1 May 2013 (UTC)Introduction (4 May 2013)Society in which Alex lives, has no such "culture of extreme youth rebellion and violence". At the contrary, Alex's "extreme youth rebellion and violence" is his only way to express his "free will", in a society where free will is forgotten, in such a society where Ludovico's technique (restraining free will) can be (wrongly) seen as a means to fight evil.Alex does not represent the society in which he lives. At the contrary, he and his taste for good music and violence, is the only way he has to act against a society where such things as good music, violence and free will, are forgotten. Akseli9 (talk) 16:18, 4 May 2013 (UTC): Your interpretation is not wrong, but you two made inexplicable (I believe ;-) changes to the sentece we talk about. Before that, the sentence "[explores] ... the desolation of free will as a solution to evil". meant that '''"the desolation of free will"''' was seen "'''as a solution to evil'''" Now I read the end of your sentence differently: "a cynical society in which free will is '''forgotten as a solution to evil'''" seems to indicate that free will is (was) a solution to evil before it (=free will) was forgotten. Free will is not "forgotten" in that society. If it is not clear what i mean, I can explain further. My only mistake is that I wrote only Picbok had confused meaning, while it had been you two. ;-) BTW consecutive edits changing or blurring the initial meaning completelely, especially in the lead of the article, are a grave danger to wiki. WikiHannibal (talk) 17:10, 4 May 2013 (UTC):: Thank you for closely following this. Sorry for the confusion, let me ask if you could find a better wording for my "forgotten". Perhaps "neglected", but this one I find it still not quite right. Your version "free will is restrained in order to find a solution to evil" applies to Ludovico Technique theories, not to the entire society. To the entire society, what would apply would be more something like "free will is forgotten", as if entire society had forgotten what free will is and that free will is essential (especially when coping with evil). Thanks is advance. Akseli9 (talk) 18:02, 4 May 2013 (UTC)::: I do not think that the society/mainstream culture depicted in the book has forgotten/neglected free will significantly more than the then existing society or our society nowadays. It is more socialistic but that is to show the blending between the Western world and Russia - that they are essentially the same. Burgess wrote about methods/principles/point of views on how to handle "evil" with relation to freedom of each indiviual. But my opinion is irrelevant and the best way would be to quote a relevant source (some critic, literature historian, not Burgess) on what this book is about.
