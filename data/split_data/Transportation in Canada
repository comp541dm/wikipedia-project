'''Transportation in Canada''', the world's second-largest country in total area, is dedicated to having an efficient, high-capacity multimodal transport spanning often vast distances between natural resource extraction sites, agricultural and urban areas. Canada's transportation system includes more than km of roads, 10 major international airports, 300 smaller airports,  of functioning railway track, and more than 300 commercial ports and harbours that provide access to the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic oceans as well as the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway. In 2005, the transportation sector made up 4.2% of Canada's GDP, compared to 3.7% for Canada's mining and oil and gas extraction industries.Transport Canada oversees and regulates most aspects of transportation within federal jurisdiction, including interprovincial transport. This primarily includes rail, air and maritime transportation. Transport Canada is under the direction of the federal government's Minister of Transport. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is responsible for maintaining transportation safety in Canada by investigating accidents and making safety recommendations.{| class="wikitable" style="float:right;"|- style=font-size:12pt;font-weight:bold"  style="text-align:center; vertical-align:bottom;"|+Gross domestic product, transport industries, 2005"Trans Sector 05"|-  style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold; vertical-align:bottom;"!Industry||Share oftransportation GDP (%)|- style="vertical-align:bottom;"|  style="height:13px; "| Air transportation|  style="text-align:right; "| 9|- style="vertical-align:bottom;"|  style="height:13px; "| Rail transportation|  style="text-align:right; "| 13|- style="vertical-align:bottom;"|  style="height:13px; "| Water transportation|  style="text-align:right; "| 3|- style="vertical-align:bottom;"|  style="height:13px; "| Truck transportation|  style="text-align:right; "| 35|- style="vertical-align:bottom;"|  style="height:13px; "| Transit and ground passenger transportation|  style="text-align:right; "| 12|- style="vertical-align:bottom;"|  style="height:13px; "| Pipeline transportation|  style="text-align:right; "| 11|- style="vertical-align:bottom;"|  style="height:26px; "| Scenic and sightseeing transport/Transport support|  style="text-align:right; "| 17|- style="vertical-align:bottom;"|  style="height:13px; font-weight:bold; "| Total:|  style="text-align:right; "| 100|}RoadsNumbered highways in CanadaThe Trans-Canada highway in Chilliwack, BCThere is a total of  of roads in Canada, of which  are paved, including  of expressways (the third-longest in the world, behind the Interstate Highway System of the United States and the China's National Trunk Highway System).

The Alaska Highway of 1942 was constructed during World War II for military purposes connecting Fort St. John, British Columbia with Fairbanks, Alaska."Year"The transcontinental highway, a joint national and provincial expenditure, was begun in 1949 under the initiation of the Trans Canada Highway Act on December 10, 1949. The  highway was completed in 1962 at a total expenditure of $1.4 billion.Internationally, Canada has road links with both the lower 48 US states and Alaska. The Ministry of Transportation maintains the road network in Ontario and also employs Ministry of Transport Enforcement Officers for the purpose of administering the Canada Transportation Act and related regulations. The Department of Transportation in New Brunswick performs a similar task in that province as well.Regulations enacted in regards to Canada highways are the 1971 Motor Vehicle Safety Act and the 1990 Highway Traffic ActThe safety of Canada's roads is moderately good by international standards, and is improving both in terms of accidents per head of population and per billion vehicle kilometers.Air transportAir transportation made up 9% of the transport sector's GDP generation in 2005. Canada's largest air carrier and its flag carrier is Air Canada, which had 34 million customers in 2006 and, as of April 2010, operates 363 aircraft (including Air Canada Jazz).

The Canadian Air Transport Security Authority is charged with the responsibility for the security of air traffic within Canada. In 1994 the National Airports Policy was enactedPrincipal airportsOf over 1,800 registered Canadian Aerodrome#Australian/Canadian usage|aerodromes, certified airports, heliports, and floatplane bases, 26 are specially designated under Canada's National Airports System (NAS): these include all airports that handle 200,000 or more passengers each year, as well as the principal airport serving each federal, provincial, and territorial capital. However, since the introduction of the policy only one, Iqaluit Airport, has been added and no airports have been removed despite dropping below 200,000 passengers. The Government of Canada, with the exception of the three territorial capitals, retains ownership of these airports and leases them to local authorities. The next tier consists of 64 regional/local airports formerly owned by the federal government, most of which have now been transferred to other owners (most often to municipalities)."NAS"Below is a table of Canada's ten biggest airports by passenger traffic in 2011.Toronto Pearson, Canada's busiest airport.Vancouver International{|class="wikitable sortable"|-!Rank||Airport||Location||style="width:100px"|TotalPassengers||Annualchange|-| align="center"| 1 || Toronto Pearson International Airport || Toronto ||align="right"|33,435,280[Lester B.

While intercity passenger transportation by rail is now very limited, freight transport by rail remains common. Total revenues of rail services in 2006 was $10.4 billion, of which only 2.8% was from passenger services. The Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Railway are Canada's two major freight railway companies, each having operations throughout North America. In 2007, 357 billion tonne-kilometres of freight were transported by rail, and 4.33 million passengers travelled 1.44 billion passenger-kilometres (an almost negligible amount compared to the 491 billion passenger-kilometres made in light road vehicles). 34,281 people were employed by the rail industry in the same year.Nationwide passenger services are provided by the federal crown corporation Via Rail. Three Canadian cities have commuter rail services: in the Montreal area by Agence métropolitaine de transport|AMT, in the Toronto area by GO Transit, and in the Vancouver area by West Coast Express. Smaller railways such as Ontario Northland, Rocky Mountaineer, and Algoma Central also run passenger trains to remote rural areas.In Canada railways are served by standard gauge, ussg, rails. See also track gauge in Canada.Canada has railway links with the lower 48 US States, but no connection with Alaska other than a train ferry service from Prince Rupert, British Columbia, although a line has been proposed.

Glazebrook, ''A history of transportation in Canada'' (1938; reprinted 1969)European contactAboriginal peoples in Canada walked. They also used  canoes, kayaks, umiaks and Bull Boats, in addition to the snowshoe, toboggan and sled in winter. They had no wheeled vehicles, and no animals larger than dogs.Europeans adopted canoes as they pushed deeper into the continent's interior, and were thus able to travel via the waterways that fed from the St. Lawrence River and Hudson Bay., an online exhibition of Canadian historical art at Library and Archives CanadaIn the 19th century and early 20th century transportation relied on harnessing oxen to ''Red River ox carts'' or horse to waggon. Maritime transportation was via manual labour such as canoe or wind on sail. Water or land travel speeds was approximately .Settlement was along river routes. Agricultural commodities were perishable, and trade centres were within . Rural areas centred around villages, and they were approximately  apart. The advent of steam railways and steamships connected resources and markets of vast distances in the late 19th century."GeoOfTrans"Railways also connected city centres, in such a way that the traveller went by sleeper, railway hotel, to the cities. Crossing the country by train took four or five days, as it still does by car. People generally lived within  of the downtown core thus the train could be used for inter-city travel and the tram for commuting.The advent of the interstate or Trans-Canada Highway in Canada in 1963 established ribbon development, truck stops, and industrial corridors along throughways.EvolutionThe Federal Department of Transport (established 2 November 1936) supervised railways, canals, harbours, marine and shipping, civil aviation, radio and meteorology. The Transportation Act of 1938 and the amended Railway Act, placed control and regulation of carriers in the hands of the Board of Transport commissioners for Canada. The Royal Commission on Transportation was formed 29 December 1948, to examine transportation services to all areas of Canada to eliminate economic or geographic disadvantages. The Commission also reviewed the Railway Act to provide uniform yet competitive freight-rates."Year"Notes;references group="note"See alsoCanadaTransport in Canada* Transport Canada, The government agency* Royal Commission on Railways*''The Romance of Transportation in Canada'', a National Film Board of Canada animated short* Taxicabs of CanadaReferences2Further reading* Brown, Ron.
