The '''anthophytes''' were thought  to be a clade comprising plants bearing flower-like structures.  The group contained the angiosperms - the extant flowering plants, such as roses and grasses - as well as the Gnetales and the extinct Bennettitales.Detailed morphological and molecular studies have shown that the group is not actually monophyletic, with proposed floral homologies of the gnetophytes and the angiosperms having evolved in parallel.Crepet2000This makes it easier to reconcile molecular clock data that suggests that the angiosperms diverged from the gymnosperms around 300.Some more recent studies have used the word anthophyte to describe a group which includes the angiosperms and a variety of fossils (glossopterids, ''Pentoxylon'', Bennettitales, and ''Caytonia''), but not the Gnetales.References4.
