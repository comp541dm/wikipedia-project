So does New World Communications, even though it hasn't operated independently since it was purchased by News Corporation in 1997. Would you please go to that article and change the wording to make it sound like it still exists? After all, that is what should be done to other articles like BellSouth, Ameritech, GTE, MCI Inc., NYNEX, King World, Pacific Telesis, Lucent Technologies (old company), Mark Goodson Productions under your rationale that any company that has been absorbed into another still exists freely to this day. It is different from the Bell Operating Companies because those companies still actively do business within the AT;T structure, or with other telephone companies, albeit they have d/b/a names now. All of the forementioned companies have been dissolved as independent entities and their operations/personnel sent to the owning company, essentially making them nothing more than a defunct holding shell. How come you keep editing the corporate infobox to make no mention of AT;T Corporation having been purchased by SBC Communications? That is why I am suspect of these edits.

Obviously there are lots of problems on all of the Bell System pages because people did not do their homework and assumed some of these companies are defunct.  The corporate infor box edit CLEARLY states that AT;T Corp is a legal subsidiary of AT;T, Inc.  BTW, there is NO SBC Communications (although it is quite obvious that that fact is just killing you!)  It is AT;T, Inc.  Obviosuly the company though more highly of the name ; history as it is so prominently featured on their corporate web site!  A defunct holding shell is your OPINION and is not in any way a legal term.  Wikipedia is based on facts and not opinions.  As for the AT;T page that page has been changed by several people to give much better facts than the very pro-SBC page its was before!  Stop using your opinions and stop vandalizing the site.

I cannot understand why this underlying historical fact is some basis for you to accuse someone of having an agenda to keep an old name alive. AT;T Inc. says it has been around for 100+ years because it seems that some people may not be able to tell a difference. I feel I have been very civil about discussing this matter, and all I have seen you do is nothing but attempt to belittle and disgrace anyone who gets in the way of what you want to see on a Wikipedia page, as witnessed also with a Little League article that has now been deleted. Several users have shown their frustration with your disruptive edits even to the point of page protection on the Verizon Communications page. I will say it again - AT;T Corporation is considered defunct in the infobox just like all of the other major defunct companies I mentioned earlier because it is no longer an independent freely running organization. It is subject to the current AT;T Inc. in all it does and in that regard is pretty much defunct in what it as a company wants to do, since its management has been replaced by AT;T Inc. That is why the other companies aforementioned, at least from what I have read and come to understand, are also called defunct. KansasCity (talk) 05:03, 23 May 2008 (UTC)You have hardly been civil or wanting to discuss issues.  Your take is that any IP user must also be a vandal.  You are the one belittling people.

A page that several people created but we were told that the info was not relevant enough.  Our only questions was why and we attempted to surce out the info.  So, is that all you do here is look up people who you don't agree with's  history on Wikipedia?  So your whole game plan is to block other's work (even when it is SOURCED) because it doesn't fit into what you think is reality!  What is reality?  SBC merged AT;T into its company in 2005.  It diddn't just change its name.  The company changed, they now have all of the assests of the old company.  All of these compnaies have ties to the original company.  You are just hung up on the fact that in 1983, AT;T corp formed 7 holding companies (in Delaware) and divested in 1984.  You dismiss relevant facts with statements like "shell of a company" oe it seems "people can't tell the difference".  Trust me if AT;T wanted them to know the difference, they would clearly spell it out.  But in reality AT;T considers its company stretching back to the glory years of the start of the telephone!!

There are INTERNAL and EXTERNAL definitions here. Here is the deal. The "OLD ATT" no longer exists and does not operate as a separate company, not in long distence, not in mobilty,not in wireline, not in data, and not in network. INTERNALLY however, there are departments still known as "affiliates" or as "legacy T" which ONLY because of the fact that common systems have not yet been established, operate as separate entities WITHIN the new ATT. This is also the case with bell south and even with companies SBC acquired much earlier, "Ameritech advanced date services" for example, still exists on paper, and Ameritech was acquired by SBC over 10 years ago. Remnants of the old ATT’s primary function has been relegated to the integration of their old customers and some products into the new companies metric. There is a lot of proprietary controversy and some internal strif that I will not go into, but suffice to say that there are individuals and groups within the ranks of the "OLD ATT" who have yet to come to terms with the fact their fledgling company was “rescued” by SBC, and are still struggling with then transition.

One is the company and one is a subsidiary.  Its very clear in the info box and article.Tymur3 (talk) 00:11, 23 September 2008 (UTC)The old logo needs top be put in the article somewher then Speer320 (talk) 00:14, 23 September 2008 (UTC)::It is. I say we keep the old logo. A lot of people are unaware that the companies are indeed separate companies with separate histories.

KansasCity (talk) 21:02, 23 September 2008 (UTC)Keep the new logo in the info box and maybe move the old logo up higher into the article. I Don't agree that they are separate companies or have really had separate histories.  First of all, a subsidiary and parent company are the same company.  AT;T Corp does not have a different CEO than AT;T, Inc.  It's all part of the same company. Second, from whenever each company was orginally founded until 1984 they did have the same history, they were all Ma Bell.  We are failing to realize that AT;T, Inc is actually 5 of the 8 companies that were split in 1984.  Third, their histories 1984-2005 are clearly stated in each article, I also don't see how a reader can be confused?? Down2000 (talk) 04:42, 24 September 2008 (UTC)Use the old logo. The whole point of this article is to describe AT;T ''Corp.'' and we should do everything possible to avoid reader confusion. Incidentally, I trust that everyone here is familiar with Wikipedia's policies including WP:SOCK. Cool Hand ''Luke'' 01:47, 25 September 2008 (UTC)Why doesn't someone just find out what the official logo is?  If AT;T uses different logos for different companies they own then we should use those logos.  If AT;T uses one logo for all of its companies then we should use that logo?  Shouldn't accuracy be the most important thing for a web site?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/68.123.205.155|68.123.205.155 (talk) 03:54, 25 September 2008 (UTC);; ;;:Due to more than a week of discussion, and since the majority of discussion has been that the old logo should be used, that is what shall be used.

The article is about AT;T Corporation.  What is AT;T Corporation?  Well, it has been established that AT;T Corp is a subsidiary of AT;T, Inc. (although people argued against that for months to no avail and they were proven wrong).  So does the subsidiary have a different logo than the parent company?  I would say it does not and someone should have to PROVE that the subsidiary has a different logo than the parent company.  Otherwise the logo should stand as is!!  The parts of the article that discuss the "old" corporation do have the old logos from 1885 to 2005.  The info box however deals with the CURRENT company.  This article was fine for about a month (August) until people wanted to come in and start edit warring!  Look at the facts and stop edit warring!Special:Contributions/69.104.19.31|69.104.19.31 (talk) 00:23, 1 October 2008 (UTC)::Well All the Other at;t, Inc subsidiaries have Their old respective logos. So why should this be any different? Speer320 (talk) 00:35, 1 October 2008 (UTC)::The article is about a corporation with a ''structure'' that no longer exists. It's about the AT;T Corp. that was an ''independent'' and ''publicly-held'' corporation until 2005. There is almost no coverage of the wholly-owned subsidiary because it's uninteresting. It's a legal vestige of the takeover. The article isn't about the subsidiary, and the box should not be about a different subject than the article. Also, from my perspective, it seems likely that only one person is actually edit warring about this: you. Cool Hand ''Luke'' 15:12, 1 October 2008 (UTC)::The legal vestige article has been made before and rebuffed.  Again, that is your opinion and Wikipedia is not about opinions but rather facts.  Fact: AT;T Corporation is a subsidiary of AT;T, Inc.  Fact: AT;T, Inc uses the "new" logo for all of their operating companies and subsidiaries.  Your above statement makes my whole point.  Yes, the article deals a great deal with the history of AT;T.  That's why any older logos SHOULD be in the article itself. However, the infobox does (and should) give current information about the company. The opening paragraph as well as the infobox are about the current corporation.  The only person throwing around accusations about users and edit warring is: you. Special:Contributions/69.104.65.110|69.104.65.110 (talk) 05:37, 3 October 2008 (UTC):::I'm not the only established user to war against WP:SPA accounts on this issue. This article is almost entirely about the old corporation. It's titled "American Telephone ; Telegraph," which is a name shared by no subsidiary of AT;T Inc. It's a name referencing the old AT;T Corp. AT;T Corporation was a subsidiary because that's how companies are acquired. The assets aren't purchased, but rather the controlling shares are, so that the target company becomes a wholly-owned part of the acquiring company. The assets become managed by the acquiring company because of the redundancy of a subsidiary board, so the target company's incorporation becomes insignificant on the merged entity's operations. Here's a list of AT;T Inc subsidiaries from America's Corporate Finance Directory:::SUBSIDIARIES:* ACC Business* AT;T* AT;T Advanced Solutions, Inc.* AT;T Business* AT;T California* AT;T Capital Services* AT;T Communications Corp* AT;T Government Solutions* AT;T Inc.

AT;T Corp. is currently a paper tiger. This is not just my opinion, and you have no references showing otherwise.:::By the way, as a lot of others have pointed out, a lot of companies are now subsidiaries of AT;T Inc. Pac Bell, SNET, ect. You don't seem to have a problem with their articles showing their historical logos. The root of your dispute seems to be your belief that AT;T Inc. is the same company as AT;T Corp. You're just flat wrong. AT;T Inc. was founded in 1984 by the divestiture consent decree. Period. Cool Hand ''Luke'' 14:07, 3 October 2008 (UTC):Look at this. Just look at all this arguing over somthing as simple as the company logo in the infobox. This is such a large amount of arguing that its size in bytes is probably larger than a readme file for a computer program! And it was all started by one IP user who acts like he is the owner of this page. There was a time long ago when there was peace on this page, no edit wars, then this IP user started arguing about whether AT;T corp still exists. It did turn out that he proved to us that AT;T corp did still exist. Then came a little while of peace. Then he started arguing about the headquarters of the company. That dispute was resolved. And then he started arguing about the logo to display in the infobox, which turned into a massive dispute that has shattered all the peace on this page. What? Do we have to block this IP user's sock-puppet account Tymur3 and then protect this article just to bring some peace???

I hope that user accepts that as a reasonable state of affairs for all of these subsidiaries. Cool Hand ''Luke'' 20:54, 5 October 2008 (UTC): The old logo ''would'' be best for the article because it represents AT;T before 2005. New logo, confusing. No logo, the reader has to read a little bit to know they're on the right article. Old logo, it represents the Pre-2005 AT;T, but if no logo at all will keep the peace, then I'm just as happy there.

My understanding is that the two companies are legally distinct.  They definitely have long separate histories.  AT;T Inc. bought out AT;T Corp. (the subject of this article), and did not functionally merge with them. Name similarities aside, the companies currently have separate functions and should therefore be left as separate articles.  Just because AT;T Corp. was spawned from the Bell Telephone Company, it doesn't mean that the Bell Telephone Company article should be moved into this article, and ditto for moving this article into AT;T Inc.

That is why I proposed a name change to '''AT;T Corp.''', since '''AT;T Corporation''' technically doesn't belong to any company currently in existence, except for an unknown usage of the full word "corporation" by those who aren't aware of the way they legally use "corp."

One of them I do not think that I could search for company names on, if I remember correctly. The other two liosted the company as AT;T '''Corp.''', including the N. Y. S. D. O. S., which listed only two names for AT;T Corp. on its page: the American Telephone ; Telegraph Company, which was used originally from the 1880s (from what I remember) to 1994, when it was changed to AT;T Corp., the latest name. I also looked up the company's later trademark registrations from the circa 2005-2006 period, and the company was listed as AT;T Corp. (along with the address being 32 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY :-o). There is a definite possibility that this company could be using "AT;T Corp." as the official name, when there are companies that use the full "Incorporated", instead of "Inc." ;-) [;#124;Retro00064;#124;User talk:Retro00064|;#9742;talk;#124;Special:Contributions/Retro00064|;#x270D;contribs;#124;] 21:56, 25 February 2011 (UTC)*'''Support''' move to ''AT;T Corporation|AT;T Corporation'', with ''AT;T Corp.|AT;T Corp.'' as an acceptable alternative but ''AT;T Corporation'' preferred. Carefully note the topic, which is distinct from  both AT;T|AT;T (aka AT;T Inc.|AT;T Inc.) and AT;T Communications|AT;T Communications which are related entities. Google     clearly supports ''AT;T'' but doesn't help with whether to abbreviate ''Corporation'', I'd just avoid the special character when other things are equal (and noting that the official standing of the abbreviation is irrelevant, see WP:AT and WP:SOAP and read carefully). Consistency within Wikipedia is not the most important criterion but in this case also supports the move.
