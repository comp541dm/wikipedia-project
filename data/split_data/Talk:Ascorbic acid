Vitamin C?Exactly how is vitamin C different from ascorbic acid? Even if strictly true in a chemical sense, a good encyclopadia will take the average reader to the terminology most used in everyday speech (first)and then gradually inform him or her what all the other alternate words are. "Ascorbic acid" is definately not used as much as the term "vitamin C", right?W. Whitney:It's definitely used more. Not only is it the actual substance (common) name, but it's what is listed in prepared food ingredients. --Belg4mit 17:22, 21 May 2007 (UTC)-----The acid hydrolysis mechanism here uses single-headed arrows. This is wrong. A single-headed arrow implies movement of single electrons (a radical mechanism). Double headed arrows should be used here, implying movement of electron pairs. 24.181.29.106----Ascorbic acid and Vitamin C are not equivalent--Vitamin C is a form of ascorbic acid (I'm believing what I'm reading). Ascorbic acid is more general, so if anything, Vitamin C should redirect into ascorbic acid.However, I think it's best if they're separate entries; ascorbic acid about the general class of ascorbic acid, Vitamin C about the L-idoslkwhater of ascorbic acid.--TheCunctator----Exactly.  isomer.  The L isomer.  Althought that isn't the onlynomenclature that can be used to describe the isomericdifferences.  I'm not an expert on the biochemistry of ascorbicacid--it could be that the L form and the D form interconvertto form a racemate in vivo, but I wouldn't bet on it.one can discuss ascorbic acid as a organic acid without anyreference to it as a nutrient.  That's why I originally put thestuff in about it's use as a reductant in chemical developersolutions--Eastman Kodak uses tons of this stuff!--JoeAnderson----Was it Haworth or Szent-Györgyi who got the Nobel for vitamin C? -- Marj Tiefert, Tuesday, June 11, 2002----both!see:Malcolm Farmer, Wednesday, June 12, 2002----Could someone check my revision of the SMILES string?

Lumos3 15:33, 26 Sep 2004 (UTC):Using the numbers for atomic weight given on wikipedia for carbon (12.0107), Hydrogen (1.00794), and Oxygen (15.9994), it's 176.12412, which would be the same as 176.12, so I edited it back. --Niffux 06:43, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)Synthesis route?I know nothing on this, but would like to see a section on how it's synthesized, and when that process was developed etc.  Thanks--Which is the "acid" hydrogen?I'm curious since the molecule doesn't have any obvious "acid" component.  Does the ring get hydrolyzed, leaving a carboxyl group? GCarty 08:57, 18 July 2005 (UTC)---While the acidic hydrogen is currently noted, I am not in agreement with how it is exemplified. Ascorbic acid is a vinylogous acid. That is it has a double bond added between the carbon and oxygen of a simple acid like acetic acid. I do not disagree with the arrows showing why the carbonyl oxygen pulls the electrons of the sp3-oxygen in and thus increasing the proton-electron pair distance, thus increasing its acidity. However, for simplicity, I would prefer a more conventional description in which the proton is removed to give a vinylogous acid with the negative charge distributed over both oxygen atoms in a traditional resonance arrow to separate the two resonance structures.Orgopete 12:42, 18 April 2007 (UTC)----This is not directly within the acid hydrogen discussion, but I am unfamiliar with contributing to a wiki, so please excuse my ignorance.The tautomerism discussion is really an extension of the vinylog acidity in that the negative charge of the anion can reside on three atoms. Therefore, protonation can logically also occur on any of the three, including on the carbon. However, that  isomer is less stable than the common structure on the page. In the tautomerism discussion, it describes the formation of the 1,2-diketone being able to form, and I think that would be the more interesting isomer to show it formation as my above discussion shows, yet the 1,2-diketone is not illustrated. Since it is simply related to the given mechanism, I suggest the formation of the 1,2-diketone preferentially or additionally be shown.Orgopete 12:56, 18 April 2007 (UTC)-----Is there any empirical evidence for the existence of the C2- or C3- protonated tautomers?  There is no reference in this section.  Absent citation of some evidence, I think this discussion should be deleted.  It has no practical relevance to understanding actual ascorbic acid or its properties.Rectifico (talk) 18:11, 17 June 2010 (UTC)To Polyparadigm and GCartyPolyparadigm- I do have infomation on the synthesis of Vitamin C in about 10 different methods, though im not really sure about copyright on the images i would need to explain it.GCarty - The OH groups  on the 'bottom' of the molecule are easily oxidised and the H+ are dissociated into solution, giving the acid, acidic preoperties.(usually only 1 H+ dissociates forming dehydroascorbic acid, therefore its is only a weak acid) the remaining oxygen form a double bonds with the carbon (a carbonyl group like you mentioned)(Eyehawk78 23:43, 1 March 2006 (UTC))The acid is the OH on the very last of the string, but not any part or near the ring.Decomposition of ascorbic acidI read somewhere (don't remember where) that vitamin C decomposes with heat.  Is this true?  (I can't find anything on it on this article so if it's there point me to it.)If so, does vitamin C continue to decompose while it's at a constant heated temperature (like, heated to 50 degrees C and then kept at 50 degrees C)?  And what's the equation for its decomposition?(I am studying chemistry at senior secondary school level (equivalent to 16-18 year olds).)  Neonumbers 10:12, 27 March 2006 (UTC):Decomposition?:At 50°C with oxygen present you get from HO-C=C-OH at the 5membered ring to the oxidated state of O=C-C=0 there this is the reaction normaly ascorbic acid is used for an anti oxidant protecting other substances to be oxidized, by being oxidized.--Stone 10:28, 27 March 2006 (UTC)So ascorbic acid doesn't decompose, but instead gets oxidised by oxygen?  (Ignore the "50 degrees" and replace 50 with some higher number if necessary.)  Then (just so ''I'' can grasp everything):*could I ask someone please to elaborate on the melting point "190 - 192°C (decomposes)"?:Merk calaloug says the same.*does that mean that if you put ascorbic acid in a closed bottle without any oxidant in it, nothing will ever happen to it no matter how heated it is (practical considerations aside)?:No! Acid esters with alkohols can give reactions and it contains both groups. The temperature is the point 50°C would be OK but for some time but every 10°C the reaction rate doubles and at this rate with 100-150°C the stuff will turn brown and black within the hour.:Other reactions then oxidation like ester cleaving is also possible!*does that mean that heating something with vitamin C merely speeds up the rate of reaction, or shifts an equilibrium, of the redox reaction, or something on the lines of thermochemical/equilibrium principles?:speed up with temperatur!*is ascorbic acid oxidised by oxygen at room temperature (albeit slowly)?:Yes slowly!Perhaps now is a good time to explain the context of my question: I am planning to investigate the effect of heat on the concentration of ascorbic acid in blackcurrant juice.

This means, by transfering the Erythorbic acid article, to the ascorbic one, the erythorbic data rappidly drawn in the ascorbic. On the other hand, by focusing on the differences in the erythorbic-article and refering to ascorbic acid on the chemical behavior both points of view may be satisfied.

Lumos3 (talk) 23:27, 15 April 2010 (UTC)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------The image of ascorbic acid may show the wrong stereochemistry. Here's why:* Since Erythorbic acid and Ascorbic acid are stereoisomers, they differ among at least one of their two chiral centres. However, the images on both pages are identical. Therefore, one MUST be wrong. Which of the two images is correct? Can someone please look it up and post the correct image?The two images :File:Erythorbic acid.png and :File:L-Ascorbic_acid.svg are not identical, they just look similar until you pay close attention.400pxBen (talk) 17:05, 5 April 2011 (UTC)Specifically, the two figures have the same chirality at the chiral center in the ring, and the opposite at the other (exocyclic) chiral center. It is the chiral center farthest from the aldehyde, which in this case is the exocyclic center, that determines D and L. Since D and L isomers are complete mirror images, D-ascorbate would differ from L-ascorbate at both centers. Now take D-ascorbate and invert the ring chiral center (so that it is the same as in L-ascorbate) and you have D-erythorbate. It might be mentioned on the erythorbate page that this is the D stereoisomer. However apparently erythorbate is readily available only as the D isomer, and ascorbate as the L (at least from Sigma) presumably because they are derived from readily available natural materials.Eaberry (talk) 23:33, 20 March 2012 (UTC)Pronunciation?Do you pronounce Ascorbic acid "uh-sore-bic" or "uh-score-bic"?
