'''''Nepeta''''' is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae also known as '''catmints'''. The genus name is reportedly in reference to Nepete, an ancient Etruscan city.. Accessed January 10, 2013 There are about 250 species.The genus is native to Europe, Asia, and Africa, and has also naturalized in North America.Some members of this group are known as '''catnip''' or catmint because of their effect on house cats – the nepetalactone contained in some ''Nepeta'' species binds to the olfactory receptors of cats, typically resulting in temporary euphoria.DescriptionMost of the species are herbaceous perennial plants, but some are annuals. They have sturdy stems with opposite heart-shaped, green to gray-green leaves."efloras"''Nepeta'' plants are usually aromatic in foliage and flowers.The tubular flowers can be lavender, blue, white, pink, or lilac, and spotted with tiny lavender-purple dots. The flowers are located in verticillasters grouped on spikes; or the verticillasters are arranged in opposite cymes, racemes, or panicles – toward the tip of the stems."efloras"The calyx is tubular or campanulate, they are slightly curved or straight, and the limbs are often 2-lipped with five teeth. The lower lip is larger, with 3-lobes, and the middle lobe is the largest. The flowers have 4 hairless stamens that are nearly parallel, and they ascend under the upper lip of the corolla. Two stamen are longer and stamens of pistillate flowers are rudimentary. The style protrudes outside of the mouth of the flowers."efloras"The fruits are nutlets, which are oblong-ovoid, ellipsoid, ovoid, or obovoid in shape. The surfaces of the nutlets can be slightly ribbed, smooth or warty."efloras"Selected speciesFile:Nepeta curviflora 1.jpg|thumb|right|Flower spikes of ''Nepeta curviflora''File:Nepeta subsessilis 1.jpg|thumb|right|''Nepeta subsessilis''* Some species formerly classified as ''Nepeta'' are now in the genera ''Dracocephalum'', ''Glechoma'', and ''Calamintha'' .{||- valign = top|*''Nepeta agrestis''*''Nepeta annua''*''Nepeta apuleii''*''Nepeta beltranii''*''Nepeta camphorata''*''Nepeta cataria'' - true catnip*''Nepeta ciliaris''*''Nepeta coerulescens''*''Nepeta congesta''*''Nepeta curviflora''*''Nepeta cyanea''*''Nepeta densiflora''*''Nepeta dentata''*''Nepeta dirphya''*''Nepeta discolor''*''Nepeta elliptica''*''Nepeta everardi''*''Nepeta floccosa''*''Nepeta foliosa''*''Nepeta fordii''*''Nepeta glutinosa''*''Nepeta govaniana''*''Nepeta granatensis''*''Nepeta grandiflora'' - Caucasus catnip*''Nepeta heldreichii''*''Nepeta hemsleyana''*''Nepeta hindostana'' - Indian catnip*''Nepeta hispanica''|*''Nepeta italica''*''Nepeta jomdaensis''*''Nepeta kokamirica''*''Nepeta kokanica''*''Nepeta laevigata''*''Nepeta lamiopsis''*''Nepeta latifolia''*''Nepeta leucolaena''*''Nepeta leucophylla''*''Nepeta longibracteata''*''Nepeta manchuriensis''*''Nepeta melissifolia''*''Nepeta membranifolia''*''Nepeta micrantha''*''Nepeta multibracteata''*''Nepeta multifida''*''Nepeta mussinii''*''Nepeta nepalensis''*''Nepeta nepetella'' - lesser catmint*''Nepeta nervosa''*''Nepeta nuda'' - hairless catmint*''Nepeta parnassica''*''Nepeta parviflora''*''Nepeta phyllochlamys''*''Nepeta prattii''*''Nepeta pungens''|*''Nepeta racemosa'' - raceme catnip*''Nepeta raphanorhiza''*''Nepeta rtanjensis''*''Nepeta scordotis''*''Nepeta sessilis''*''Nepeta sibirica''*''Nepeta sibthorpii''*''Nepeta souliei''*''Nepeta spruneri''*''Nepeta staintonii''*''Nepeta stewartiana''*''Nepeta subsessilis''*''Nepeta sungpanensis''*''Nepeta supina''*''Nepeta taxkorganica''*''Nepeta tenuiflora''*''Nepeta tenuifolia''*''Nepeta tuberosa''*''Nepeta ucranica''*''Nepeta veitchii''*''Nepeta virgata''*''Nepeta wilsonii''*''Nepeta yanthina''*''Nepeta zandaensis'''''Natural hybrids'''* Nepeta × faassenii|''Nepeta'' × ''faassenii''|}UsesCultivationSome ''Nepeta'' species are cultivated as ornamental plants. They can be drought tolerant – water conserving, often deer repellent, with long bloom periods from late spring to autumn. Some species also have repellent properties to insect pests, including aphids and squash bugs, when planted in a garden."mbot"''Nepeta'' species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species including ''Coleophora albitarsella'', and as nectar sources for pollinators, such as honeybees and hummingbirds.;Selected ornamental species* ''Nepeta cataria'' (catnip, catswort) – the "true catnip", cultivated as an ornamental plant, has become an invasive species in some habitats.* ''Nepeta grandiflora'' (giant catmint, Caucasus catmint) – lusher than true catnip and has dark green leaves and dark blue flowers.* Nepeta × faassenii|''Nepeta'' × ''faassenii'' (garden catmint) – a hybrid of garden source with gray-green foliage and lavender flowers.
