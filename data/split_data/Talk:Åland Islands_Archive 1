This is an excellent example of the unpleasant fact that the world has changed since August, 1914.  There is almost nothing of any value in the 1911 encyclopedia's geographical entries other than physical dimensions of the earth - and those are all too often in fathoms, which I'm sure you devotees of the SI system find as annoying as I find it's appalling pope-baiting in the history articles.  It is well worth evaluating your time and effort porting these sad little documents and thinking of what we often have to do with them once they're here. --MichaelTinkler-----The following has been moved from Talk:Aland:#Can we do better than to turn Å into A? E.g., is "Aa" an acceptable orthography here as it sometimes is in Danish?#Åland "is mentioned as a member of the Nordic countries" --- but by whom? By Wikipedia?I know of an island off the coast of Sweden called Oland (I think there may be some sort of diacritical mark on the 'o')  Is this the same island?No, Öland is another island in the Baltic sea and quite traditionally a part of Sweden might I add :-) --Anders TörlindThis article need to be rewritten from scratch. While some historical fact are correct some were correct only at the time of writing (1911). The worst is what's left out. As an intermediate action you should scrap the article and just leave a refernce to where more up-to-date and hence correct information may be found. I also find it amusing/saddening that you even bother looking at such ancient materials as a 1911 encyclopedia. If the rest of the wikipedia holds the same quality it is just a waste of precious cyberspace. Can't wait to read the article on "Germany" ... or "negro" -- Robin Rosenberg
