Permanence, Spinoza, BuddhismSpinoza teaches that we should look for something permanent but " Buddhism teaches that such a quest is bound to fail. " ? Where does he teach that?Nirvana IS permanent! The whole point of Buddhism is to disover what the Buddha in the Nikayas calls "the unborn" - that which transcends time. Let alone the Mahayana sutras who directly speak of the Nirvanic state as BLISS, THE SELF (Atman), and PERMANENT, ETERNAL, PURE. (Mahaparanirvana Sutra)Article Organisation and nameWhy is this article organised into sections such as Metaphysics, Epistemology, etc - which are branches of Western philosophy? Shouldn't the sections be based on the key Buddhist concepts such as Anatta, Pratitya Samutpada, etc?:There is nothing wrong with using English words to describe Buddhist ideas.

This is not to say that the Buddha doesn't reject them, of course, but that's covered under saying he rejects metaphysical being.I'm moving the pratitya-samutpada section into metaphysics and phenomenology where it belongs; causation is not a problem of logic in Indian philosophy, it is a problem of metaphysics, and, in Buddhism, a problem of psychology or phenomenology.User:Kukkurovaca|;#2325;;#2369;;#2325;;#2381;;#2325;;#2369;;#2352;;#2379;;#2357;;#2366;;#2330; 21:07, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)Explanation of revertI thought the deleted paragraph had some value in its original form.  I didn't find it to be particularly trite.  Also, I think "non-theistic" is better than "atheistic".  "Atheism", as people often use it and as W'pedia defines it, seems to rule out a "middle way" balancing act.  In conclusion, please allow me to say that I think the paragraph's last sentence preeemptively expresses Kukku's concerns about a tendentious definition of religion.  That's all, thank you. - Nat Krause 04:19, 22 Jun 2004 (UTC): I am happier with non-theistic than with atheistic; however, I do object to having a pragraph that's so problematic that it has to conclude with a disclaimer that it may be moot before we ever get to what the article is actually about.

However, (1) I have found that some Buddhists in fact do include theistic and polytheistic beliefs, in spite of many Buddhist writings suggesting this is inappropriate, and (2) the term "atheistic" tends to be confusing in cultures in which religion is equated with belief in God. The result is often the follow-up explanation that Buddhism is more of a philosophy than a religion. That's consistent with my own view but I don't think it accurately describes how the majority of practioners view it. Maybe description of beliefs isn't the primary goal here, but if not the article will probably end up being assertive of a particular view and not Buddhism as it is actually thought about and practiced.::LinkSomeone added this link to the page, and while it doesn't seem like a horrible site on a first glance, it does seem like a personal one, and perhaps not exactly NPOV, etc. Can folks take a look at it and convey reflections?User:Kukkurovaca| -- ;#2325;;#2369;;#2325;;#2381;;#2325;;#2369;;#2352;;#2379;;#2357;;#2366;;#2330;|User talk:Kukkurovaca|Talk;#8253; 22:00, 28 Jun 2004 (UTC)vegetarianA bot changed vegetarians to vegetarians, since the former is a double-redirect.

There are many people including myself who try to adhere to Buddhist ideals and principles without being religious about it in any way.  The two articles cover distinct areas of knowledge.  The merge notice should be removed. Hu 20:34, 25 January 2006 (UTC)Even ''if'' Buddhist philosophy had strong religious association (for instance, if the philosophy were organised around questions seeking to justify faith and doctrine) it would ''still'' be legitimate in being kept separate from Buddhist religious philosophy or Buddhism in general ... there don't seem to be any proposals to rename the Christian philosophy page.  A further argument is that Buddhist philosophy, in general, doesn't tend to be oriented toward the same things that scripture/doctrine based inquiries are oriented.  There are many streams of inquiry in Buddhist philosophy that have nothing to do with attempts to confirm or refute doctrine or proposed religious entities.  Buddhist philosophy tends to be more method than subject matter. (Leo T) 66.91.249.23 05:56, 1 February 2006 (UTC)It is irrelevant because the new section is created in Buddhism article. Philosophy subsection in Buddhism has direct link to this article. VapourNew Proposal-Renaming the title to Buddhism and PhilosophyThe title is confusing. Metaphysics, Epistemology and Phenomenology are concept developed and belong to (Western) philosophy. Buddhism's idea should be explained in its own term probably by expanding the article about dependent origination. This article is essentially an comparative study and the title of the article should reflect on it, IMO.  VapourI vote NO. The curent title is just fine.

The Indian tradition of Dharmakirti and Dignaga were definitely doing serious philosophy, albeit through a Buddhist lens. This is like saying that Christian scholasticism and Islamic philosophy is not philosophy because the people doing it were religious! Buddhism is a religion, but Buddhists did practice philosophy such as logic (nyaya) and epistemology (pramana). I would refer to the work of those such as Mark Siderits and Jay Garfield on this.

This was a misconception of early scholarship. The whole section is confused. Mitsube (talk) 21:40, 18 September 2008 (UTC)Other debates in metaphysics and phenomenology include the issue of the ''pudgala'', or "person", which was postulated by the Pudgalavada school as that which transmigrates and which carries the burden of karma from one life to another. Other schools made unsurprising objection to this. There were further sub-debates regarding whether the ''pudgala'' was real or illusory or something in between.;/blockquote;This uncited sentence seems completely misleading and in fact false. No scholar would say that Yogachara is a monistic philosophy and this whole section is thus tainted.

It should be paraphrased. Also note that the style guidelines for quotations recommend avoiding wikilinks within quotations (i.e., the text should appear ''exactly'' as it does in the source). Where hypertextual elucidation of terms is desireable, paraphrase of the source material, integrating it into the article's own voice, is probably also merited.
