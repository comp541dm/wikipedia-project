Youngest expansion franchise to win a World SeriesThe Diamondbacks became the youngest ''expansion'' franchise to win a World Series in 2001, winning it in their fourth season.  However, it is incorrect to say, as too many sportswriters have done, that they were the youngest-ever World Series champions.  The Boston Red Sox won the first World Series, in 1903, in only their third season of play.  The Red Sox were charter members of the American League, which played its first major-league season in 1901. --RjLeschJermaine DyeSince when did Jermaine Dye get traded to the diamondbacks ? where have I been ?

The Diamondbacks have already released their 2016 uniforms. I suggest that they should be updated to the article as soon as possible. MahuCG (talk) 17:21, 31 January 2016 (UTC)
