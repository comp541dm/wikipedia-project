Practical achievementsSort these, not all are his:Practical achievementsFuller introduced a number of concepts, and helped develop others.Certainly, a number of his projects were not successful in terms of commitment from industry or acceptance by most of the public. However, more than 500,000 geodesic domes have been built around the world and many are in use. According to the Buckminster Fuller Institute, the largest geodesic-dome structures are:* Seagaia Ocean Dome: Miyazaki, Japan, 216m (710ft).* Multi-Purpose Arena: Nagoya, Japan, 187m (614ft).*Tacoma Dome: Tacoma, Washington, USA, 162m (530ft).*Superior Dome: Northern Michigan Univ. Marquette, Michigan, USA, 160m (525ft).*Walkup Skydome: Northern Arizona Univ. Flagstaff, Arizona, USA, 153m (502ft).*Poliedro de Caracas: Caracas, Venezuela, 145m (475ft).[]* Round Valley High School Stadium: Springerville-Eagar, Arizona, USA, 134m (440ft).* Former Spruce Goose Hangar: Long Beach, California, USA, 126m (415ft).* Formosa Plastics Storage Facility: Mai Liao, Taiwan, 123m (402ft).* Union Tank Car Maintenance Facility: Baton Rouge, Louisiana USA, 117m (384ft), destroyed in November 2007.[2theadvocate.com News | Kansas City Southern razes geodesic dome— Baton Rouge, LA;;]* Lehigh Portland Cement Storage Facility: Union Bridge, Maryland USA, 114m (374ft).*The Eden Project, Cornwall, United Kingdom[– The Eden Project]Other notable domes include:* Spaceship Earth at Disney World's Epcot Center in Florida, 80.8-meters (265ft) wide (Spaceship Earth is actually a self-supporting geodesic sphere, the only one currently in existence.)* The former USA Pavilion at Expo 67 in Montréal -  76 meters wide (250ft) - became the Montreal Biosphère, an environmental museum on Île Sainte-Hèlène.  In 1967, the US government selected the Dome structure, but did not retain the world vision exposition concept proposed by Buckminster Fuller: A giant Planet Earth Globe within the Dome with a multimedia presentation that would have demonstrated how we could make the world work for all of humanity within 10 years if we switched from "Killingry to Livingry".* The Gold Dome in Oklahoma City, formerly a bank and now a multicultural society and business center.* Downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, is a geodesic sphere hosting the Telus World of Science, a science centre (formerly called Science World), that was originally the Expo Centre built for Expo 86.* The dome over a shopping center in downtown Ankara, Turkey, 109.7-meter (360ft) tall* The dome enclosing a civic center in Stockholm, Sweden, 85.3-meter (280ft) high.* The world's largest aluminum dome formerly housed the “Spruce Goose” airplane in Long Beach Harbor, California, USA.However, contrary to Fuller's hopes, domes are not an everyday sight in most places. In practice, most of the smaller owner-built geodesic structures had disadvantages (see geodesic domes), including their unconventional appearance.A spin-off of Fuller's dome-design conceptualization was the , which was the official FIFA approved design for footballs (association football), from their introduction at the 1970 World Cup until recently. The design was a truncated icosahedron – essentially a "Geodesic Sphere", consisting of 12 pentagonal and 20 hexagonal panels. This was used continuously for 34 years until replaced by the 14-panel Teamgeist for the 2006 World Cup.Fuller was followed (historically) by other designers and architects, such as Sir Norman Foster and Steve Baer, willing to explore the possibilities of new geometries in the design of buildings, not based on conventional rectangles.First paragraph of BiographyNot really sure if this should go in the talk page, but the first paragraph of the biography is not cited.

I'd been recruited to tie-dye banners to hang from the tall street lamps on Fifth Avenue. Somebody said that we were right upstairs from the headquarters of "Rat", the underground newspaper where the "mad bomber" sent letters predicting where the next bomb would explode. Then, when the day arrived, Bucky came to Columbia to address about 150 people on the concept of spaceship earth. He had peculiar ideas about the filling of space. He argued that using cubes and cubic units to measure space was illogical. I didn't get it. He proposed using another space-filling solid (with square and triangular faces) as a fundamental unit for conceptualizing volume. On the subject of space-filling spheres, he pointed out that a circle could be surrounded by six congruent circles, and they'd all touch their neighbors, so one layer of spheres is perfect, in a way. If you put an identical layer of spheres on top of it, they'd fall into depressions in the first layer, and that would leave out a minimum of volume outside the spheres, or a maximum within them. But when you attempt to add a third layer, things get interesting, because you can place it so the spheres are directly above the ones on the first layer, or you can place it another way. So there's no unique, perfect way to do it. Either way is perfect.

Fuller's principles about geodesic lines included specific circles of struts similar to the classical arch for maximum strength. If you look at plans for real Fuller domes, you might be surprised how many different lengths of the struts are used to channel the structural forces in an optimized way.I haven't yet found out about the Bauersfeld dome, and I can't tell about the rotating animation, but I suspect that both are built in a more economic way, with as little as possible different strut lengths.(Also, as I understood it, the concept of "geodesic" only makes sense in relation to gravity, so a ball spinning in space might be rather pointless.) Similarly that Kyushu dome mentioned above could be something else. I don't know about that.The biggest geodesic dome was a railway tank car servicing depot in the southern US IIRC. I'll have to look it up again before I can go into more details.'''Eden Project is obviously ''not'' geodesic''': If you trace a line of struts you can't find a single great-circle. I also suspect, that all struts are the same length in any given dome.Don't understand me wrong: I'm not a "Fuller was the biggest genius ever" fanboy, and I also love Eden Project - but I am an engineer, and I'm trying to get the technical details unmuddled. --BjKa (talk) 14:10, 9 January 2013 (UTC): A geodesic is a "straightest" possible path in a curved space; on a sphere, a geodesic is a great circle.

Here is a high quality reference from ''The New Yorker'' magazine, June 9, 2008 : ; July 12, 1895– July 1, 1983) was an American architect, systems theorist, author, designer and inventor.Fuller published more than 30 books, coining or popularizing terms such as "Spaceship Earth", ephemeralization, and synergetic. He also developed numerous inventions, mainly architectural designs, and popularized the widely known geodesic dome. Carbon molecules known as fullerenes were later named by scientists for their structural and mathematical resemblance to geodesic spheres.Fuller was the second World President of Mensa from 1974 to 1983.BiographyAs a young manFuller was born on July 12, 1895, in Milton, Massachusetts, the son of Richard Buckminster Fuller and Caroline Wolcott Andrews, and also the grand-nephew of the American Transcendentalist Margaret Fuller. He attended Friedrich Fröbel|Froebelian Kindergarten. Spending much of his youth on Bear Island, in Penobscot Bay off the coast of Maine, he had trouble with geometry, being unable to understand the abstraction necessary to imagine that a chalk dot on the blackboard represented a mathematical point, or that an imperfectly drawn line with an arrow on the end was meant to stretch off to infinity. He often made items from materials he brought home from the woods, and sometimes made his own tools. He experimented with designing a new apparatus for human propulsion of small boats. By the age of 12 he had "invented" a 'push pull' system for propelling a row boat through the use of an inverted umbrella connected to the transom with a simple oar lock which allowed the user to face forward to point the boat toward its destination. Later in life Fuller took exception to the term "invention".Years later, he decided that this sort of experience had provided him with not only an interest in design, but also a habit of being familiar with and knowledgeable about the materials that his later projects would require. Fuller earned a machinist's certification, and knew how to use the press brake, stretch press, and other tools and equipment used in the sheet metal trade.EducationFuller attended Milton Academy in Massachusetts, and after that began studying at Harvard University, where he was affiliated with Adams House. He was expelled from Harvard twice: first for spending all his money partying with a vaudeville troupe, and then, after having been readmitted, for his "irresponsibility and lack of interest." By his own appraisal, he was a non-conforming misfit in the fraternity environment.pawleyWartime experienceBetween his sessions at Harvard, Fuller worked in Canada as a mechanic in a textile mill, and later as a laborer in the meat-packing industry. He also served in the U.S. Navy in World War I, as a shipboard radio operator, as an editor of a publication, and as a crash rescue boat commander. After discharge, he worked again in the meat packing industry, acquiring management experience. In 1917, he married Anne Hewlett. During the early 1920s, he and his father-in-law developed the Stockade Building System for producing light-weight, weatherproof, and fireproof housing—although the company would ultimately failpawleyin 1927.Depression and epiphanyBuckminster Fuller recalled 1927 as a pivotal year of his life. His daughter Alexandra had died in 1922 of complications from polio and spinal meningitis just prior to her fourth birthday. Fuller dwelled on her death, suspecting that it was connected with the Fullers' damp and drafty living conditions."Sieden-1989-Buckminster-Fuller's-Universe"This provided motivation for Fuller's involvement in Stockade Building Systems, a business which aimed to provide affordable, efficient housing."Sieden-1989-Buckminster-Fuller's-Universe"In 1927 Fuller, then aged 32, lost his job as president of Stockade. The Fuller family had no savings to fall back upon, and the birth of their daughter Allegra in 1927 added to the financial challenges. Fuller was drinking heavily and reflecting upon the solution to his family's struggles on long walks around Chicago. During the autumn of 1927, Fuller contemplated suicide, so that his family could benefit from a life insurance payment.Fuller said that he had experienced a profound incident which would provide direction and purpose for his life. He felt as though he was suspended several feet above the ground enclosed in a white sphere of light. A voice spoke directly to Fuller, and declared:Fuller stated that this experience led to a profound re-examination of his life. He ultimately chose to embark on "an experiment, to find what a single individual [could] contribute to changing the world and benefiting all humanity."Speaking to audiences later in life, Fuller would regularly recount the story of his Lake Michigan experience, and its transformative impact on his life."Sieden-1989-Buckminster-Fuller's-Universe"Historians have been unable to identify direct evidence for this experience within the 1927 papers of Fuller's Chronofile archives, housed at Stanford University. Stanford historian Barry Katz suggests that the suicide story may be a myth which Fuller constructed later in life, to summarize this formative period of his career.RecoveryIn 1927 Fuller resolved to think independently which included a commitment to "the search for the principles governing the universe and help advance the evolution of humanity in accordance with them... finding ways of ''doing more with less'' to the end that all people everywhere can have more and more." By 1928, Fuller was living in Greenwich Village and spending much of his time at the popular café Romany Marie's, where he had spent an evening in conversation with Marie and Eugene O'Neill several years earlier.Lloyd Steven Sieden. ''Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work'' (pp.74, 119–142). New York: Perseus Books Group, 2000. ISBN 0-7382-0379-3. p.74: "Although O'Neill soon became well known as a major American playwright, it was Romany Marie who would significantly influence Bucky, becoming his close friend and confidante during the most difficult years of his life." Fuller accepted a job decorating the interior of the café in exchange for meals,"HaberGlueck"giving informal lectures several times a week,"Sieden-p74"and models of the Dymaxion house were exhibited at the café. Isamu Noguchi arrived during 1929—Constantin Brâncuși, an old friend of Marie's, had directed him there"HaberGlueck"—and Noguchi and Fuller were soon collaborating on several projects,"Haskell"including the modeling of the Dymaxion car based on recent work by Aurel Persu. Includes several images. It was the beginning of their lifelong friendship.Geodesic domesFuller taught at Black Mountain College in North Carolina during the summers of 1948 and 1949, serving as its Summer Institute director in 1949. There, with the support of a group of professors and students, he began reinventing a project that would make him famous: the geodesic dome. Although the geodesic dome had been created some 30 years earlier by Dr. Walther Bauersfeld, Fuller was awarded United States patents. He is credited for popularizing this type of structure.One of his early models was first constructed in 1945 at Bennington College in Vermont, where he frequently lectured. In 1949, he erected his first geodesic dome building that could sustain its own weight with no practical limits. It was  in diameter and constructed of aluminium aircraft tubing and a vinyl-plastic skin, in the form of an icosahedron. To prove his design, Fuller suspended from the structure's framework several students who had helped him build it. The U.S. government recognized the importance of his work, and employed his firm Geodesics, Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina to make small domes for the Marines. Within a few years there were thousands of these domes around the world.Fuller's first "continuous tension – discontinuous compression" geodesic dome (full sphere in this case) was constructed at the University of Oregon Architecture School in 1959 with the help of students. These continuous tension – discontinuous compression structures featured single force compression members (no flexure or bending moments) that did not touch each other and were 'suspended' by the tensional members.Best-known workFor half of a century, Fuller developed many ideas, designs and inventions, particularly regarding practical, inexpensive shelter and transportation. He documented his life, philosophy and ideas scrupulously by a daily diary (later called the ''Dymaxion Chronofile''), and by twenty-eight publications. Fuller financed some of his experiments with inherited funds, sometimes augmented by funds invested by his collaborators, one example being the Dymaxion car project.World stageFile:Biosphère Montréal.jpg|right|thumb|The Montreal Biosphère by Buckminster Fuller, 1967International recognition began with the success of huge geodesic domes during the 1950s. Fuller lectured at NC State University in Raleigh in 1949, where he met James Fitzgibbon, who would become a close friend and colleague. Fitzgibbon was director of Geodesics, Inc. and Synergetics, Inc. the first licensees to design geodesic domes. Thomas C. Howard was lead designer, architect and engineer for both companies.Fuller began working with architect Shoji Sadao"wrsc.org"in 1954, and in 1964 they co-founded the architectural firm Fuller ; Sadao Inc., whose first project was to design the large geodesic dome for the U.S. Pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal.  This building is now the "Montreal Biosphère".From 1959 to 1970, Fuller taught at Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIU). Beginning as an assistant professor, he gained full professorship in 1968, in the School of Art and Design. Working as a designer, scientist, developer, and writer, he lectured for many years around the world. He collaborated at SIU with the designer John McHale. In 1965, Fuller inaugurated the World Design Science Decade (1965 to 1975) at the meeting of the International Union of Architects in Paris, which was, in his own words, devoted to "applying the principles of science to solving the problems of humanity." Later in his SIU tenure, Fuller was also a visiting professor at SIU Edwardsville, where he designed the dome for the campus Religious Center.Fuller believed human societies would soon rely mainly on renewable sources of energy, such as solar- and wind-derived electricity. He hoped for an age of "omni-successful education and sustenance of all humanity." Fuller referred to himself as "the property of universe" and during one radio interview he gave later in life, declared himself and his work "the property of all humanity". For his lifetime of work, the American Humanist Association named him the 1969 Humanist of the Year.In 1976, Fuller was a key participant at UN Habitat I, the first UN forum on human settlements.HonorsFuller was awarded 28 United States patents and many honorary doctorates. In 1960, he was awarded the Frank P. Brown Medal from The Franklin Institute. Fuller was elected as an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa in 1967, on the occasion of the 50th year reunion of his Harvard class of 1917 (from which he was expelled in his first year). He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1968.  In 1968 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1970. In 1970 he received the Gold Medal award from the American Institute of Architects. He also received numerous other awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom presented to him on February 23, 1983, by President Ronald Reagan.Last filmed appearanceFuller's last filmed interview took place on April 3, 1983, in which he presented his analysis of Simon Rodia's Watts Towers as a unique embodiment of the structural principles found in nature. Portions of this interview appear in ''I Build the Tower,'' a documentary film on Rodia's architectural masterpiece.DeathGravestone (see trim tab)Fuller died on July 1, 1983, 11 days before his 88th birthday. During the period leading up to his death, his wife had been lying comatose in a Los Angeles hospital;;, dying of cancer. It was while visiting her there that he exclaimed, at a certain point: "She is squeezing my hand!" He then stood up, suffered a heart attack, and died an hour later, at age 87. His wife of 66 years died 36 hours later. They are buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Philosophy and worldviewThe grandson of Unitarian minister Arthur Buckminster Fuller, R. Buckminster Fuller was also Unitarian. Buckminster Fuller was an early environmental activist. He was very aware of the finite resources the planet has to offer, and promoted a principle that he termed "ephemeralization", which, in essence—according to futurist and Fuller disciple Stewart Brand—Fuller coined to mean "doing more with less". Resources and waste material from cruder products could be recycled into making more valuable products, increasing the efficiency of the entire process. Fuller also introduced synergetics, an encompassing term which he used broadly as a metaphoric language for communicating experiences using geometric concepts and, more specifically, to reference the empirical study of systems in transformation, with an emphasis on total system behavior unpredicted by the behavior of any isolated components. Fuller coined this term long before the term synergy became popular.Fuller was a pioneer in thinking globally, and he explored principles of energy and material efficiency in the fields of architecture, engineering and design. He cited François de Chardenedes' opinion that petroleum, from the standpoint of its replacement cost out of our current energy "budget" (essentially, the net incoming solar flux), had cost nature "over a million dollars" per U.S. gallon (US$300,000 per litre) to produce. From this point of view, its use as a transportation fuel by people commuting to work represents a huge net loss compared to their earnings. An encapsulation quotation of his views might be, "There is no energy crisis, only a crisis of ignorance."Fuller was concerned about sustainability and about human survival under the existing socio-economic system, yet remained optimistic about humanity's future. Defining wealth in terms of knowledge, as the "technological ability to protect, nurture, support, and accommodate all growth needs of life," his analysis of the condition of "Spaceship Earth" caused him to conclude that at a certain time during the 1970s, humanity had attained an unprecedented state. He was convinced that the accumulation of relevant knowledge, combined with the quantities of major recyclable resources that had already been extracted from the earth, had attained a critical level, such that competition for necessities was not necessary anymore. Cooperation had become the optimum survival strategy. "Selfishness," he declared, "is unnecessary and hence-forth unrationalizable.... War is obsolete." He criticized previous utopian schemes as too exclusive, and thought this was a major source of their failure. To work, he thought that a utopia needed to include everyone.So it is not surprising that he and others of his stature were attracted by Korzybski's ideas in ''general semantics''. General semantics is a discipline of mind that seeks to unify persons and nations by changing their worldview reaction and the philosophy of their expression. In the 1950s Fuller attended seminars and workshops organized by the Institute of General Semantics, and he delivered the annual Alfred Korzybski Memorial Lecture in 1955.  Korzybski is mentioned in the Introduction of his book ''Synergetics''. The two gentlemen shared a remarkable amount of similarity in their formulations of general semantics.In his 1970 book ''I Seem To Be a Verb'', he wrote: "I live on Earth at present, and I don't know what I am. I know that I am not a category. I am not a thing—a noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process—an integral function of the universe."Fuller wrote that the natural analytic geometry of the universe was based on arrays of tetrahedra. He developed this in several ways, from the close-packing of spheres and the number of compressive or tensile members required to stabilize an object in space. One confirming result was that the strongest possible homogeneous truss is cyclically tetrahedral.Edmondson, Amy, "A Fuller Explanation", Birkhauser, Boston, 1987, p19 tetrahedra, p110 octet trussHe had become a guru of the design, architecture, and 'alternative' communities, such as Drop City, the community of experimental artists to whom he awarded the 1966 "Dymaxion Award" for "poetically economic" domed living structures.Major design projectsFile:Géode V 3 1.gif|frame|A geodesic sphereThe geodesic domeFuller was most famous for his lattice shell structures – geodesic domes, which have been used as parts of military radar stations, civic buildings, environmental protest camps and exhibition attractions. An examination of the geodesic design by Walther Bauersfeld for the Zeiss-Planetarium, built some 20 years prior to Fuller's work, reveals that Fuller's Geodesic Dome patent (U.S. 2,682,235; awarded in 1954), follows the same design as Bauersfeld's.Their construction is based on extending some basic principles to build simple "tensegrity" structures (tetrahedron, octahedron, and the closest packing of spheres), making them lightweight and stable. The geodesic dome was a result of Fuller's exploration of nature's constructing principles to find design solutions. The Fuller Dome is referenced in the Hugo Award-winning novel ''Stand on Zanzibar'' by John Brunner, in which a geodesic dome is said to cover the entire island of Manhattan, and it floats on air due to the hot-air balloon effect of the large air-mass under the dome (and perhaps its construction of lightweight materials).TransportationDymaxion carFile:Dymaxion car photo.jpg|thumb|285px|The Dymaxion car, c.1933, artist Diego Rivera shown entering the car, carrying coatThe Dymaxion car was a vehicle designed by Fuller, featured prominently at Chicago's 1933-1934 Century of Progress World's Fair.2101057 During the Great Depression, Fuller formed the ''Dymaxion Corporation'' and built three prototypes with noted naval architect Starling Burgess and a team of 27 workmen ;mdash; using gifted money as well as a family inheritance.Fuller associated the word ''Dymaxion'' with much of his work, a portmanteau of the words '''''dy'''namic'', '''''max'''imum'', and ''ten'''sion''''' to sum up the goal of his study, "maximum gain of advantage from minimal energy input."The Dymaxion was not an automobile ''per se'', but rather the 'ground-taxying mode' of a vehicle that might one day be designed to fly, land and drive ;mdash; an "Omni-Medium Transport" for air, land and water.  Fuller focused on the landing and taxiing qualities, and noted severe limitations in its handling.  The team made constant improvements and refinements to the platform,"universe"and Fuller noted the Dymaxion "was an invention that could not be made available to the general public without considerable improvements.""universe"The bodywork was aerodynamically designed for increased fuel efficiency and speed as well as light weight, and its platform featured a lightweight cromoly-steel hinged chassis, rear-mounted V8 engine, front-drive and three-wheels. The vehicle was steered via the third wheel at the rear, capable of 90° steering lock. Thus able to steer in a tight circle, the Dymaxion often caused a sensation,  bringing nearby traffic to a halt.Shortly after launch, a prototype crashed after being hit by another car, killing the Dymaxion's driver.  The other car was driven by a local politician and was illegally removed from the accident scene, leaving reporters who arrived subsequently to blame the Dymaxion's unconventional design ;mdash; though investigations exonerated the prototype."accident"Fuller would himself later crash another prototype with his young daughter aboard.Despite courting the interest of important figures from the auto industry, Fuller used his family inheritance to finish the second and third prototypes ;mdash; eventually selling all three, dissolving ''Dymaxion Corporation'' and maintaining the Dymaxion was never intended as a commercial venture.  One of the three original prototypes survives.HousingFile:Dymaxion house.jpg|thumb|right|A Dymaxion house at The Henry FordFuller's energy-efficient and inexpensive Dymaxion house garnered much interest, but has never been produced. Here the term "Dymaxion" is used in effect to signify a "radically strong and light tensegrity structure". One of Fuller's Dymaxion Houses is on display as a permanent exhibit at The Henry Ford in Dearborn, Michigan. Designed and developed during the mid-1940s, this prototype is a round structure (not a dome), shaped something like the flattened "bell" of certain jellyfish. It has several innovative features, including revolving dresser drawers, and a fine-mist shower that reduces water consumption. According to Fuller biographer Steve Crooks, the house was designed to be delivered in two cylindrical packages, with interior color panels available at local dealers. A circular structure at the top of the house was designed to rotate around a central mast to use natural winds for cooling and air circulation.Conceived nearly two decades before, and developed in Wichita, Kansas, the house was designed to be lightweight and adapted to windy climates. It was to be inexpensive to produce and purchase, and assembled easily. It was to be produced using factories, workers, and technologies that had produced World War II aircraft. It was ultramodern-looking at the time, built of metal, and sheathed in polished aluminum. The basic model enclosed  of floor area. Due to publicity, there were many orders during the early Post-War years, but the company that Fuller and others had formed to produce the houses failed due to management problems.In 1967 he developed a concept for an offshore floating city named Triton City and published a report on the design the following year. Models of the city aroused the interest of President Lyndon B. Johnson who, after leaving office, had them placed in the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum.In 1969, Fuller began the Otisco Project, named after its location in Otisco, New York. The project developed and demonstrated concrete spray technology used in conjunction with mesh covered wireforms as a viable means of producing large scale, load bearing spanning structures built on site without the use of pouring molds, other adjacent surfaces or hoisting.The initial construction method used a circular concrete footing in which anchor posts were set. Tubes cut to length and with ends flattened were then bolted together to form a duodeca-rhombicahedron (22-sided hemisphere) geodesic structure with spans ranging to m. The form was then draped with layers of ¼-inch wire mesh attached by twist ties. Concrete was then sprayed onto the structure, building up a solid layer which, when cured, would support additional concrete to be added by a variety of traditional means. Fuller referred to these buildings as monolithic ferroconcrete geodesic domes. The tubular frame form proved too problematic when it came to setting windows and doors, and was abandoned. The second method used iron rebar set vertically in the concrete footing and then bent inward and welded in place to create the dome's wireform structure and performed satisfactorily. Domes up to three stories tall built with this method proved to be remarkably strong. Other shapes such as cones, pyramids and arches proved equally adaptable.The project was enabled by a grant underwritten by Syracuse University and sponsored by US Steel (rebar), the Johnson Wire Corp, (mesh) and Portland Cement Company (concrete). The ability to build large complex load bearing concrete spanning structures in free space would open many possibilities in architecture, and is considered as one of Fuller's greatest contributions.Dymaxion map and World GameFuller also designed an alternative projection map, called the Dymaxion map. This was designed to show Earth's continents with minimum distortion when projected or printed on a flat surface. In the 1960s, Fuller developed the World Game, a collaborative simulation game played on a 70-by-35-foot Dymaxion map, in which players attempt to solve world problems. The object of the simulation game is, in Fuller's words, to “make the world work, for 100% of humanity, in the shortest possible time, through spontaneous cooperation, without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone.”Appearance and styleBuckminster Fuller wore thick-lensed spectacles to correct his extreme myopia, a condition that went undiagnosed for the first five years of his life."Sieden-1989-Buckminster-Fuller's-Universe"7 Fuller's hearing was damaged during his Naval service in World War I and deteriorated during the 1960s.tomkins-1966After experimenting with bullhorns as hearing aids during the mid-1960s, Fuller adopted electronic hearing aids from the 1970s onward"Sieden-1989-Buckminster-Fuller's-Universe"397Buckminster Fuller exclusively dressed in dark-colored suits during his public appearances, appearing like "an alert little clergyman".Kenner-Guided-Tour18 Fuller had previously experimented with unconventional clothing immediately after his 1927 epiphany. However, he found that breaking social fashion customs made others devalue or dismiss his ideas.6:15 Fuller learned the importance of physical appearance as part of one's credibility, and decided to become "the invisible man" by dressing in clothes that would not draw attention to himself.Fuller-Maharishi-19716:15 With self-deprecating humor, Fuller described this black-suited appearance as resembling a "second-rate bank clerk".Fuller-Maharishi-19716:15QuirksFollowing his global prominence from the 1960s onward, Fuller became a frequent flier, often crossing time zones to lecture in international cities. In the 1960s and 70s, he wore three watches simultaneously; one for the time zone of his office in Carbondale, one for the time zone of the location he would next visit, and one for the time zone he was currently in."Kenner-Guided-Tour"290 In the 1970s, Fuller was only in 'homely' locations (his personal home in Carbondale, Illinois; his holiday retreat in Bear Island, Maine; his daughter's home in Pacific Palisades, California) roughly 65 nights per year—the other 300 nights were spent in hotel beds in the locations he visited on his lecturing and consulting circuits."Kenner-Guided-Tour"290In the 1920s, Fuller experimented with polyphasic sleep, which he called ''Dymaxion sleep''. Inspired by the sleep habits of the animals such as dogs and cats,133 Fuller worked until he was tired, and then slept short naps. This generally resulted in Fuller sleeping 30-minute naps every 6 hours.160 This allowed him "twenty-two thinking hours a day", which aided his work productivity."Kenner-Guided-Tour"160 Fuller reportedly kept this Dymaxion sleep habit for two years, before quitting the routine because it conflicted with his business associates' sleep habits. Despite no longer personally partaking in the habit, in 1943 Fuller suggested Dymaxion sleep as a strategy that the United States could adopt to win World War II."Time-Magazine-1943-Dymaxion Sleep"Despite only practising true polyphasic sleep for a period during the 1920s, Fuller was known for his stamina throughout his life. He was described as "tireless"53 by Barry Farrell in ''Life'' magazine, who noted that Fuller stayed up all night replying to mail during Farrell's 1970 trip to Bear Island."Life-Magazine-1971-Farrell"55 When he was aged in his seventies, Fuller generally slept for 5–8 hours per night."Kenner-Guided-Tour"160Fuller documented his life copiously from 1915 to 1983, approximately m of papers in a collection called the Dymaxion Chronofile. He also kept copies of all incoming and outgoing correspondence. The enormous Fuller Collection is currently housed at Stanford University.If somebody kept a very accurate record of a human being, going through the era from the Gay 90s, from a very different kind of world through the turn of the century—as far into the twentieth century as you might live. I decided to make myself a good case history of such a human being and it meant that I could not be judge of what was valid to put in or not. I must put everything in, so I started a very rigorous record.;/blockquote;In his youth, Fuller experimented with several ways of presenting himself: R. B. Fuller, Buckminster Fuller, but as an adult finally settled on R. Buckminster Fuller, and signed his letters as such. However, he preferred to be addressed as simply "Bucky".Language and neologismsBuckminster Fuller spoke and wrote in a unique style and said it was important to describe the world as accurately as possible."What is important in this connection is the way in which humans reflex spontaneously for that is the way in which they usually behave in critical moments, and it is often "common sense" to reflex in perversely ignorant ways that produce social disasters by denying knowledge and ignorantly yielding to common sense." Intuition, 1972 Doubleday, New York. p.103 Fuller often created long run-on sentences and used unusual compound words (omniwell-informed, intertransformative, omni-interaccommodative, omniself-regenerative) as well as terms he himself invented.He wrote a single unpunctuated sentence approximately 3000 words long titled "What I Am Trying to Do." And It Came to Pass – Not to Stay Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1976.Fuller used the word ''Universe'' without the definite or indefinite articles (''the'' or ''a'') and always capitalized the word. Fuller wrote that "by Universe I mean: the aggregate of all humanity's consciously apprehended and communicated (to self or others) Experiences.""How Little I Know" from And It Came to Pass – Not to Stay Macmillan, 1976The words "down" and "up", according to Fuller, are awkward in that they refer to a planar concept of direction inconsistent with human experience. The words "in" and "out" should be used instead, he argued, because they better describe an object's relation to a gravitational center, the Earth. "I suggest to audiences that they say, 'I'm going "outstairs" and "instairs."' At first that sounds strange to them; They all laugh about it. But if they try saying in and out for a few days in fun, they find themselves beginning to realize that they are indeed going inward and outward in respect to the center of Earth, which is our Spaceship Earth. And for the first time they begin to feel real 'reality.'""World-around" is a term coined by Fuller to replace "worldwide". The general belief in a flat Earth died out in classical antiquity, so using "wide" is an anachronism when referring to the surface of the Earth—a spheroidal surface has area and encloses a volume but has no width. Fuller held that unthinking use of obsolete scientific ideas detracts from and misleads intuition. Other neologisms collectively invented by the Fuller family, according to Allegra Fuller Snyder, are the terms "sunsight" and "sunclipse", replacing "sunrise" and "sunset" to overturn the geocentric bias of most pre-copernican celestial mechanics.Fuller also invented the word "livingry," as opposed to weaponry (or "killingry"), to mean that which is in support of all human, plant, and Earth life. "The architectural profession—civil, naval, aeronautical, and astronautical—has always been the place where the most competent thinking is conducted regarding livingry, as opposed to weaponry."As well as contributing significantly to the development of tensegrity technology, Fuller invented the term "tensegrity" from ''tensional integrity''. "Tensegrity describes a structural-relationship principle in which structural shape is guaranteed by the finitely closed, comprehensively continuous, tensional behaviors of the system and not by the discontinuous and exclusively local compressional member behaviors. Tensegrity provides the ability to yield increasingly without ultimately breaking or coming asunder.""Dymaxion" is a portmanteau of "'''dy'''namic '''max'''imum tens'''ion'''". It was invented about 1929 by two admen at Marshall Field's department store in Chicago to describe Fuller's concept house, which was shown as part of a house of the future store display. They created the term utilizing three words that Fuller used repeatedly to describe his design – dynamic, maximum, and tension.''R. Buckminster Fuller – Autobiographical Monologue/Scenario'',St. Martin’s Press, Inc.,1980, page 54.Fuller also helped to popularize the concept of Spaceship Earth: "The most important fact about Spaceship Earth: an instruction manual didn't come with it." 090810 cjfearnley.comConcepts and buildingsHis concepts and buildings include:{||* Dymaxion house (1928)* Fuller Home - Carbondale, Illinois* Aerodynamic Dymaxion car (1933)* Prefabricated compact bathroom cell (1937)* Dymaxion deployment unit (1940)* Dymaxion map of the world (1946)* Buildings (1943)* Tensegrity structures (1949)|* Geodesic dome for Ford Motor Company (1953)* Patent on geodesic domes (1954)* The World Game (1961) and the World Game Institute (1972)* Patent on octet truss (1961)* Montreal Biosphère (1967), United States pavilion at Expo 67* Fly's Eye Dome* Comprehensive anticipatory design scienceSalsbury, Patrick G.
