Aluminum vs. Aluminium:''Moved to Talk:Aluminium/Spelling#Aluminum_vs._Aluminium''Resolution of cite errorPrior to  there was a cite error in the References, highlighted in red. The cause of the error was that the inline citation called  was defined twice.  In addition to the two different definitions, there were four slave applications ofUllmann.The two definitions of this  refer to:*”Aluminum” by W.B. Frank (2009) in ''Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'' (currently Reference No. 8)*”Aluminum Compounds, Organic” by O. Helmboldt (2007) in ''Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'' (currently Reference No. 57)In my edit I resolved the error by renaming the second definition . The red error message disappeared.The four slave applications of the Ullmann reference remain directed to Frank’s article “Aluminum” rather than to Helmboldt’s article “Aluminum Compounds, Organic”. I don’t have access to ''Ullmann’s Encyclopedia''. I would appreciate it if someone who does have access can check the four slave applications and change any of them that should be directed to Helmboldt’s article. User:Dolphin51|''Dolphin'';/font; ''(User talk:Dolphin51|t;/font;)'' 06:21, 2 November 2015 (UTC): introduced the second Ullmann ref; . It doesn't appear that any of the later changes altered any reuse of this ref-name, therefore I think the new ref can just be renamed and leave all other refs pointing to the old.

Special:Contributions/65.196.34.7|65.196.34.7 (talk) 20:42, 26 January 2016 (UTC)Correction:  History:  name "''alumine''"At present, the '''History''' section states:  ''"In 1761, Guyton de Morveau suggested calling the base alum ''alumine''."''Almost every source on the history of aluminium repeats this claim.  They are all wrong.Morveau coined the name ''alumine'' in 1782, not 1761.(1)  One will notice that '''no''' source that makes this claim ever cites the source of this claim.  This uniformity is extremely suspicious because it indicates that no one actually knows what the original source was.  This, in turn, indicates that the claim is false:  no one can find an original citation for it because none exists.(2)  If anyone had bothered to read a biography of Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, they would have learned that he was a lawyer who first became involved in a scientific and literary society in 1764, and even then, he initially submitted only literary works.  (See p. 181 of:  Jaimes Wisniak (July 2003) , ''Educacion Química'', '''14''' :  180-189.)  He was therefore not in a position in 1761 to dictate a new nomenclature to the international community of chemists.  (Why would professional chemists pay attention to a lawyer dabbling in amateur chemistry?)(3)  The first mention of the word ''alumine'' occurred in 1782; specifically, page 378 of:  de Morveau (1782)  (Memoir on chemical names, the necessity of improving the system, and rules for attaining it), ''Observations sur la physique, sur l'histoire naturelle, et sur les arts, …'', '''19''' :  370-382.  From p. 378:''"La seconde terre est celle qui sert de base à l'alun:  en la nommant argille, il faudroit chercher un autre nom au minéral, qui n'en recèle jamais qu'une portion; il faudroit, suivant notre second principe, substituer le mot argilleux au mot alumineux, pour tous ses composés.  Il est plus simple de conserver le dernier, ; en tirer un substantif, pour indiquer l'étre primitif.  Ainsi, l'on dira que l'alun ou vitriol ''alumineux'' a pour base l'''alumine'', que la Nature nous offre abondamment dans les ''argilles''."''Translation:  The second earth is what serves as the base in alum:  by naming it "clay", one would have to seek another name for the mineral, which never harbors even a part of it; one would have to, following our second principle [for naming chemical compounds], substitute the word "clay-ish" for the word "aluminous" in all its compounds.  It is simpler to retain the latter and to draw a noun from it, in order to indicate the primitive entity [i.e., element].  Thus, one will say that alum or ''aluminous'' sulfate has as [its] base ''alumine'' [i.e., aluminium], which Nature offers us abundantly in ''clays''.Earlier publications by Guyton de Morveau mention alum (French:  ''alun''), but do not mention ''alumine''.  See, for example:  de Morveau (1781)  (Memoir on simple earths and principally on those that one names "absorbants"; followed by an appendix on a new proof of the existence of phlogiston in chalk and by some observations on the calcareous phosphoric salt or regenerated bony substance), ''Observations sur la physique, sur l'histoire naturelle, et sur les arts, …'', '''17''' :  216-231. On p. 225, Guyton de Morveau states that clay consists of aluminium (which he calls ''argile pure'' (pure clay) or ''terre base d'alun'' (earth base of alum)) and silicate (''silex'' (flint)), but doesn't use his term for aluminium (''alumine''):  ''"II.  L'argile pure ou terre base d'alun, que la Nature nous présente en si grandes masses, mais presque toujours mêlée de silex, … "''  (II.  Pure clay or earth base of alum, which Nature presents to us in such great masses, but nearly always mixed with flint [i.e., silica] … )  Thus in 1780, Morveau calls the "base" of alum "pure clay", whereas in 1782, he would propose the name "''alumine''".(4)  (Wisniak, 2003), p. 181, states that Morveau published most of his papers in two scientific journals:  ''Mémoires de l'Académie impériale des sciences, arts et belles-lettres de Dijon'' (which first appeared in 1769 (here is )) and ''Observations sur la physique, sur l'histoire naturelle, et sur les arts, …'' (which was published during 1752-1757 then resumed during 1771-1785 (see:  )).  So neither journal was published in 1761.  More importantly, (Wisniak, 2003), p. 183, states that Morveau published his first scientific paper in 1769.  ()  It would be difficult to reconcile the claim that he named aluminium ''"alumine"'' in 1761 with the fact that he published his first scientific work in 1769.(5)  Here are three secondary sources that state that Morveau coined the term "''alumine''" in 1782:*  Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales:  Etymologie:  [Alumine] (in French)  (This source quotes the same passage from (Morveau, 1782) that I quoted above.)*  A. Darmesteter, ''De la Création Actuelle de Mots Nouveaux dans la Langue Française et des Lois qui la Régissent'' [On the contemporary creation of new words in the French language and on the laws that govern it], (Paris, France:  F.
