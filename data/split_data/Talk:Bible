The bit about "Christian Bibles" is blatantly false, and they both constitute original research. User:StAnselm|St;/b;Special:Contributions/StAnselm|Anselm (talk) 21:46, 18 September 2015 (UTC):* Actually, the statements are broadly accurate (that the Hebrew bible was basically written in Hebrew whereas Christian appendages to it, eg. the entire NT, were basically written in Koine Greek). Sources:  Although I'd weaken the editorialisation (the "''The;/u; unifying property''" part). Cesiumfrog (talk) 23:16, 18 September 2015 (UTC)thats all that listed on historical higher criticism?? a paragraph????"There is no single Bible"I have changed the line in the introduction that read "There is no single "Bible" and many Bibles with varying contents exist." This statement is tendencious and reflects an anti-religious bias, but moreover it is misleading. Although the list of canonically accepted "books" of the Bible does vary, it varies only slightly. And although the Jewish Bible does not contain the Christian scriptures, the Christian Bible does include the Jewish Bible in its entirety. Thus there is not a plurality of Bibles, but only of Bible canons. It is misleading to say that "many Bibles exist" - this implies that there are a number of completely different and unrelated books which all go by the name "Bible".  Wwallacee (talk) 12:56, 7 November 2015 (UTC):Have you checked to make sure that the wording you changed it to actually reflects what the source says? If not, then you are attributing words and thoughts to an author who didn't present them. --Airborne84 (talk) 18:34, 21 December 2015 (UTC)Semi-protected edit request on 8 January 2016;;;;Request to edit the page:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible.Currently:The '''Bible''' ;;(from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, ''tà biblía'', "the books") is a collection of texts sacred in Judaism and Christianity.Suggested Change:The '''Bible''' ;;(from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, ''tà biblía'', "the books") is a collection of texts sacred in Judaism, Christianity and Islam.Discussion:  Jews, Christians and Muslims are all People of the Book.  As discussed in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_view_of_the_Christian_Bible, Muslims believe that three of the books made it through history unscathed but that the rest were corrupted.  They believe the Koran is the corrected text, but still the Bible.  How shall we accurately and sensitively edit this text to indicate this?  Professional discussion may be required.Greg Hebertgreg@gjhebert.commulticad@ix.netcom.com734.355.6619;;Ghebert (talk) 13:41, 8 January 2016 (UTC):File:Red information icon with gradient background.svg|20px|link= '''Not done:''' please establish a consensus for this alteration before using the edit semi-protected template.;; It would be misleading to mention in the first sentence that the Bible is considered sacred in Islam, as it might imply that it is a central religious text in Islam -- it's not. The Islamic view of the Christian Bible is already mentioned in the body of this article under the subsection "Other religions". Whether to include it in the lead might be worth discussing, but I don't believe it should go in the first sentence.
