Cabo Verdean Marines.The '''Cabo Verdean Armed Forces''' () or '''FACV''' are the military of Cape Verde. They include two branches, the National Guard and the Coast Guard.HistoryBefore 1975, Cape Verde was an overseas province of Portugal, having a small Portuguese military garrison. This included both Cabo Verdean and European Portuguese soldiers.At the same time, some Cabo Verdeans were serving in the People's Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARP), the military organization of the PAIGC party that was fighting for the joint independence of Guinea and Cape Verde in the Guinea-Bissau War of Independence. The FARP became the national armed forces of Guinea-Bissau, when its independence was recognized by Portugal in 1974.The Armed Forces of Cape Verde were created when the independence of the country occurred in 1975, being also officially designated as the '''People's Revolutionary Armed Forces''' (''Forças Armadas Revolucionárias do Povo'') or '''FARP'''. The Cabo Verdean FARP were made of two independent branches, the Army (''Exército'') and the Coast Guard (''Guarda Costeira'').In the early 1990s, the designation "FARP" was dropped and the military of Cape Verde started to be designated as the Cabo Verdean Armed Forces (''Forças Armadas Cabo Verdeanas'') or FACV.In 2007, the FACV started a major reorganization, that included the transformation of the Army into the National Guard (''Guarda Nacional'').Together with the Cabo Verdean Police, the FACV carried away Operation ''Flying Launch'' (''Operacão'' Lancha Voadora), a major successful operation to try to put an end to a drug trafficking group who smuggled cocaine from Colombia to the Netherlands and Germany and who used Cape Verde as a reorder point. The whole operation took more than three years, being a secret operation during the two first years, being finished in 2010.Although located in Africa, Cape Verde had always close relations with Europe. Because of this, several opinions defend that Cape Verde may enter the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the NATO.StructureDornier 228 of the Cabo Verdean Coast Guard.The Cabo Verdean Armed Forces are part of the Ministry of National Defense of Cape Verde and include:* the Military bodies of command:** Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces (CEMFA),** Office of the CEMFA,** Staff of the Armed Forces (EMFA),** Personnel Command,** Logistics Command;* the National Guard;* the Coast Guard.The CEMFA is Colonel, being the highest rank officer of the Armed Forces.National GuardImage:Policia Militar Cabo Verde 2006.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Military Police in MindeloThe National Guard (''Guarda National'') is the main branch of the Cabo Verdean Armed Forces for the military defense of the country, being responsible for the execution of land and maritime environment operations and the support to internal security.
