'''Professional certification''', '''trade certification''', or '''professional designation''', often called simply ''certification'' or ''qualification'', is a designation earned by a person to assure qualification to perform a job or task. Not all certifications that use post-nominal letters are an acknowledgement of educational achievement, or an agency appointed to safeguard the public interest.OverviewCertifications are earned from a professional society, university, a certification body, or from a private certifier, for some specific certifications (e.g.,Microsoft, Cisco, etc.). Some certifications must be renewed periodically, or may be valid for a specific period of time (e.g.,the lifetime of the product upon which the individual is certified). As a part of a complete renewal of an individual's certification, it is common for the individual to show evidence of continued learning;mdash;often falsely termed continuing education;mdash;or earning continuing education units (CEU).Many certification programs are created, sponsored, or affiliated with professional associations, trade organizations, or private vendors interested in raising standards. Many of those programs completely independent from membership organizations enjoy association support and endorsement.::The growth of certification programs is also a reaction to the changing employment market. Certifications are portable, since they do not depend on one company's definition of a certain job. Certification stands about the resume and the professional reference by being an impartial, third-party endorsement of an individual's professional knowledge and experience.Phillip Barnhart,  (1997), HRD Press. ISBN 0-8493-9960-2 Retrieved electronically 7 July 2009.Certifications are usually earned from a professional society or educational institute, not the government. However, a government agency can decree a certification is required ''by law'' for a person to be allowed to perform a task or job. Certification is different from professional licensure. In the United States, professional licenses are usually issued by state agencies, having as a requirement the university title for that profession. In other countries, licensing is granted by the professional society or college, but you need to certificate after some years (usually three to five) and so on thereafter. The certification assessment process, for some organizations, is very similar or even the same as licensure and may differ only in terms of legal status, while in other organizations, can be quite different and more comprehensive than that of licensure.The American National Standards Institute (ANSI), Standard1100, defines the requirements of meeting the ANSI standard for being a certifying organization. According to ANSIStandard1100, a professional certifying organization must meet two requirements:# Deliver an assessment based on industry knowledge, independent from training courses or course providers.# Grant a time-limited credential to anyone who meets the assessment standards.Certifications are very common in aviation, construction, technology, environment, and other industrial sectors, as well as health care, business, Real estate broker and finance. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration regulates aviator certifications.The Institute for Credentialing Excellence (ICE) is a U.S.-based organization that sets rigorous standards for accreditation of certification programs based on the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (APA, AERA, NCME). Many members of the Association of Test Publishers (ATP) are also certification organizations.Types of certificationsThere are three general types of certification. Listed in order of development level and portability, they are: corporate (internal), product-specific, and profession-wide.Corporate, or "internal" certifications, are made by a corporation or low-stakes organization for internal purposes. For example, a corporation might require a one-day training course for all sales personnel, after which they receive a certificate. While this certificate has limited portability – to other corporations, for example – it is the most simple to develop.Product-specific certifications are more involved, and are intended to be referenced to a product across all applications. This approach is very prevalent in the information technology (IT) industry, where personnel are certified on a version of software or hardware. This type of certification is portable across locations (for example, different corporations that use that software), but not across other products. Another example could be the certifications issued for shipping personnel, which are under international standards even for the recognition of the certification body, under an International Maritime Organization (IMO).The most general type of certification is profession-wide. Certification in the medical profession is often offered by particular specialties. In order to apply professional standards, increase the level of practice, and protect the public, a professional organization might establish a certification. This is intended to be portable to all places a certified professional might work. Of course, this generalization increases the cost of such a program; the process to establish a legally defensible assessment of an entire profession is very extensive. An example of this is a Certified Public Accountant(CPA), which would not be certified for just one corporation or one piece of accountancy software but for general work in the profession.Professional certificates awarded by universitiesMany universities grant professional certificates as an award for the completion of an educational program. The curriculum of a professional certificate is most often in a focused subject matter. Many professional certificates have the same curriculum as master's degrees in the same subject. Many other professional certificates offer the same courses as master's degrees in the same subject, but require the student to take fewer total courses to complete the program. Some professional certificates have a curriculum that more closely resembles a baccalaureate major in the same field.  The typical professional certificate program is between 200-300 class-hours in size. It is uncommon for a program to be larger or smaller than that. Most professional certificate programs are open enrollment, but some have admissions processes. A few universities put some of their professional certificates into a subclass they refer to as advanced professional certificates.Some of the more commonly offered professional certificates include:* Professional Certificate in Accounting (PCA)* Professional Certificate in Customer Relationship Management (PCCRM)* Professional Certificate in Financial Planning (PCFP)* Professional Certificate in Graphic Design (PCGD)* Professional Certificate in Human Resources (PCHR)* Professional Certificate in Marketing (PCM)* Professional Certificate in Paralegal Studies (PCPS)* Professional Certificate in Project Management (PCPM)* Professional Certificate in Supply Chain Management (PCSCM)* Professional Certificate in Store Management (PCSM)* Professional Certificate in Materials Management (PCMM)* Professional Certificate in Technical Communication (PCTC)Areas of certificationAccountancy, auditing and financeThere are many professional bodies for accountants and auditors throughout the world; some of them are legally recognized in their jurisdictions.Public accountants are the accountancy and control experts that are legally certified in different jurisdictions to work in public practices, certifying accounts as statutory auditors, eventually selling advice and services to other individuals and businesses. Today, however, many work within private corporations, financial industry, and government bodies.Accounting and external auditingCf.

Service Quality System includes activities like security, maintenance, catering, and external as well as internal cleaning. In general, it is also the coordination and harmonization of various specialist disciplines to create the best possible working environment for staff.Facility management is an interdisciplinary field devoted to the coordination of space, infrastructure, people and organization, often associated with the administration of office blocks, arenas, schools, convention centers, shopping complexes, hospitals, hotels, etc. However, FM facilitates on a wider range of activities than just business services and these are referred to as non-core functions.*CFE (Certified Facilities Executive), conferred by the International Association of Venue Managers (IAVM).*CFMP (Certified Facility Management Professional) conferred by The Institute of Contract, Project and Facility Management*AICPFM (Associate Member: conferred by The Institute of Contract, Project and Facility Management (ICPFM)*MICPFM (Chartered Member: conferred by The Institute of Contract, Project and Facility Management(ICPFM)*FICPFM (Chartered Fellow: conferred by The Institute of Contract, Project and Facility Management (ICPFM)Warehousing managementA warehouse management system (WMS) is a key part of the supply chain and primarily aims to control the movement and storage of materials within a warehouse and process the associated transactions, including shipping, receiving, putaway and picking. The systems also direct and optimize stock putaway based on real-time information about the status of bin utilization. A WMS monitors the progress of products through the warehouse. It involves the physical warehouse infrastructure, tracking systems, and communication between product stations.More precisely, warehouse management involves the receipt, storage and movement of goods, (normally finished goods), to intermediate storage locations or to a final customer. In the multi-echelon model for distribution, there may be multiple levels of warehouses. This includes a central warehouse, a regional warehouses (serviced by the central warehouse) and potentially retail warehouses (serviced by the regional warehouses).*CSMMP (Certified Stores and Materials Management Professional: conferred by The Certified Institute of Warehousing and Materials Management (CIWMM)*ACIWM (Associate Member: conferred by The Certified  Institute of Warehousing and Materials Management (CIWMM)*MCIWM (Chartered Member: conferred by The Certified  Institute of Warehousing and Materials Management (CIWMM)*FCIWM (Chartered Fellow: conferred by The Certified  Institute of Warehousing and Materials Management (CIWMM)Enterprise risk management* APC, Academy of Professional Certification (APC) Limited, an approved charitable NGO organization, Certification Body, managed by ISO 31000/ ISO 29100/ ISO 22300 Members that authorized by HKSARG, and supporting by various professional bodies, universities, governments and international organizations* CRP, Certified Risk Planner, conferred and mutually accredited by the Institute of Crisis ; Risk Management (ICRM) or Academy of Professional Certification (APC)* FCRP, Fellow of Certified Risk Planner, conferred and mutually accredited by the Institute of Crisis ; Risk Management (ICRM) or Academy of Professional Certification (APC)* CRT, Certified Risk Trainer, conferred and mutually accredited by the Institute of Crisis ; Risk Management (ICRM) or Academy of Professional Certification (APC)* CCC, Certified Crisis Consultant, conferred and mutually accredited by the Institute of Crisis ; Risk Management (ICRM) or Academy of Professional Certification (APC)* CIE, Certified International Entrepreneur, conferred and mutually accredited by the International Entrepreneurs Association (IEA)* CLRMC ISO 31000, Certified Lead Risk Management Consultant for ISO 31000, conferred and accredited by Academy of Professional Certification (APC)* CPA ISO 31000, Certified Professional Auditor of Enterprise Risk Management for ISO 31000, conferred and accredited by Academy of Professional Certification (APC)* CPT ISO 31000, Certified Professional Trainer for ISO 31000, conferred and accredited by Academy of Professional Certification (APC)* CPCM ISO 22301/292, Certified Professional Crisis Manager for ISO 292 Security Management and ISO 22301 Business Continuity Management, conferred and accredited by Academy of Professional Certification (APC)* CPERM ISO 31010, Certified Professional Enterprise Risk Manager for ISO 31000 and ISO 31010, conferred and accredited by Academy of Professional Certification (APC)* CPIA ISO 29100, Certified Privacy Impact Assessor for ISO 29100 and ISO 31010, conferred and accredited by Academy of Professional Certification (APC)* CPQRM ISO 9001:2015, Certified Professional Quality Risk Manager of ISO 31000 for ISO 9001:2015, an upgrade path for existing ISO 9001:2008 quality manager to be certified with new risk management ISO 31000 requirement conferred and accredited by Academy of Professional Certification (APC)* FCPCM ISO 22301/292, Certified Professional Crisis Manager for ISO 292 Security Management and ISO 22301 Business Continuity Management, conferred and accredited by Academy of Professional Certification (APC)* FCPERM ISO 31010, Fellow of Certified Professional Enterprise Risk Manager for ISO 31000 and ISO 31010, conferred and accredited by Academy of Professional Certification (APC* FCPIA ISO 29100, Fellow of Certified Privacy Impact Assessor for ISO 29100 and ISO 31010, conferred and accredited by Academy of Professional Certification (APC)* FCPQRM ISO 9001:2015, Fellow of Certified Professional Quality Risk Manager of ISO 31000 for ISO 9001:2015, conferred and accredited by Academy of Professional Certification (APC)* CRMP (Certified Risk Management Professional) by the Disaster Recovery Institute InternationalEntrepreneurial professionProfessional certification and qualification (Entrepreneurship)*IEA,UK (International Entrepreneurs Association)IEA | conferred by International Entrepreneurs Association.International Entrepreneurs Association|Environment*[National Registry of Environmental Professionals] – recognized NGO offering list of Environmental and Safety Certifications*Institute of Professional Environmental Practice – Qualified Environmental Professional (QEP)*[Academy of Board Qualified Environmental Professionals] - Certified Environmental Professional (CEP)*CEnvP – Certified Environmental Practitioner ''of Australia and New Zealand'' (CEnvP)*International Society of Arboriculture - internationally recognized body providing ANSI-Accredited certifications for arborists.

Most provision worldwide is through the state school system of each individual country, and as such, the instructors tend to be trained primary- or secondary school teachers who are native speakers of the language of their pupils, and not of English. Though native speakers of English have been working in non-English speaking countries in this capacity for years, it was not until the last twenty-five years or so that there was any widespread focus on training particularly for this field. Previously, workers in this sort of job were anyone from backpackers hoping to earn some extra travel money to well-educated professionals in other fields doing volunteer work, or retired people. These sort of people are certainly still to be found, but there are many who consider TESOL their main profession.One of the problems facing these full-time teachers is the absence of international governing body for the certification or licenture of English language teachers. However, Cambridge University and its subsidiary body UCLES are pioneers in trying to get some degree of accountability and quality control to consumers of English courses, through their CELTA and DELTA programs. Trinity College London has equivalent programs, the CertTESOL and the LTCL DipTESOL. They offer initial certificates in teaching, in which candidates are trained in language awareness and classroom techniques, and given a chance to practice teaching, after which feedback is reported. Both institutions have as a follow-up a professional diploma, usually taken after a year or two in the field. Although the initial certificate is available to anyone with a high school education, the diploma is meant to be a post-graduate qualification and in fact can be incorporated into a master's degree program.Legal affairsAn increasing number of lawyers are choosing to be recognized as having special knowledge and experience by becoming certified specialists in certain fields of law. According to the American Bar Association, a lawyer that is a certified specialist has been recognized by an independent professional certifying organization as having an enhanced level of skill and expertise, as well as substantial involvement in an established legal specialty. These organizations require a lawyer to demonstrate special training, experience and knowledge to ensure that the lawyer's recognition as a certified specialist is meaningful and reliable. Lawyer conduct with regard to specialty certification is regulated by the states.NBLSC is an American Bar Association (ABA) accredited organization providing Board Certification for US Lawyers. Board Certification is a rigorous testing and approval process that officially recognizes the extensive education and courtroom experience of attorneys. NBLSC provides Board Certification for Trial Lawyers ; Trial Attorneys, Civil Lawyers, Criminal Lawyers, Family Lawyers and Social Security Disability Lawyers.Logistics and transportLogistician is the Profession in the logistics ; transport sectors, including sea, air, land and rail modes.

Protestant churches typically require a Masters of Divinity, accreditation by the denomination and ordination by the local church in order for a minister to become a "Reverend". Those qualifications may or may not also give government authorization to solemnize marriagesMedicineMedical credentialsBoard certification is the process by which a physician in the United States documents by written, practical or computer based testing, illustrating a mastery of knowledge and skills that define a particular area of medical specialization. The American Board of Medical Specialties, a not-for-profit organization, assists 24 approved medical specialty boards in the development and use of standards in the ongoing evaluation and certification of physicians.Medical specialty certification in the United States is a voluntary process. While medical licensure sets the minimum competency requirements to diagnose and treat patients, it is not specialty specific.[What Board Certification Means]. Abms.org. Retrieved on 2013-10-05. Board certification demonstrates a physician’s exceptional expertise in a particular specialty or sub-specialty of medical practice.Patients, physicians, health care providers, insurers and quality organizations regard certification as an important measure of a physician’s knowledge, experience and skills to provide quality health care within a given specialty.Other professional certifications include certifications such as medical licenses, Membership of the Royal College of Physicians, Fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, nursing board certification, diplomas in social work. The Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy certifies pharmacists that are knowledgeable about principles of geriatric pharmacotherapy and the provision of pharmaceutical care to the elderly.

Reason.com (2010-09-17). Retrieved on 2013-10-05.;Computer technologiesThe current proliferation of IT certifications (both offered and attained) , like the Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik|FSI's IT baseline protection certification, has led some technologists to question their value. Proprietary content that has been distributed on the Internet allows some to gain credentials without the implied depth or breadth of expertise. Certifying agencies have responded in various ways: Some now incorporate hands-on elements, anti-cheating methodologies or have expanded their content. Others have expired and restructured their certificate programs or raised their fees to deter abuse.Certification programs that take into account length of service and demonstrated experience via industry peer and employer recommendation avoid some of the issues associated with purely passing an examination; however, certification remains a contentious issue.Also, some professional certifications require a criminal record check for the certification to be approved. The presence of a criminal history when applying for certification may be grounds for denial of certification.See also*Academic Inflation*European professional qualification directives*Homologation*Institute for Certification of Computing Professionals*Product certificationReferences;;External linksallzh-min-nan:Chèng-chiàude:Zertifizierungis:Faggildingja:資格th:ใบอนุญาตประกอบวิชาชีพzh:專業認證
