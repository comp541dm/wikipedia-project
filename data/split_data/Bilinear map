In mathematics, a '''bilinear map''' is a function combining elements of two vector spaces to yield an element of a third vector space, and is linear in each of its arguments. Matrix multiplication is an example.DefinitionVector spacesLet ''V'', ''W'' and ''X'' be three vector spaces over the same base field ''F''. A bilinear map is a function:''B'' : ''V'' × ''W'' → ''X''such that for any ''w'' in ''W'' the map:''v'' ↦ ''B''(''v'', ''w'')is a linear map from ''V'' to ''X'', and for any ''v'' in ''V'' the map:''w'' ↦ ''B''(''v'', ''w'')is a linear map from ''W'' to ''X''.In other words, when we hold the first entry of the bilinear map fixed while letting the second entry vary, the result is a linear operator, and similarly for when we hold the second entry fixed.If  and we have  for all ''v'', ''w'' in ''V'', then we say that ''B'' is ''symmetric''.The case where ''X'' is the base field ''F'', and we have a '''bilinear form''', is particularly useful (see for example scalar product, inner product and quadratic form).ModulesThe definition works without any changes if instead of vector spaces over a field ''F'', we use modules over a commutative ring ''R''. It generalizes to ''n''-ary functions, where the proper term is ''multilinear''.For non-commutative rings ''R'' and ''S'', a left ''R''-module ''M'' and a right ''S''-module ''N'', a bilinear map is a map  with ''T'' an (''R'', ''S'')-bimodule, and for which any ''n'' in ''N'',  is an ''R''-module homomorphism, and for any ''m'' in ''M'',  is an ''S''-module homomorphism.  This satisfies:''B''(''r'' ⋅ ''m'', ''n'') = ''r'' ⋅ ''B''(''m'', ''n''):''B''(''m'', ''n'' ⋅ ''s'') = ''B''(''m'', ''n'') ⋅ ''s''for all ''m'' in ''M'', ''n'' in ''N'', ''r'' in ''R'' and ''s'' in ''S'', as well as ''B'' being additive in each argument.PropertiesA first immediate consequence of the definition is that  whenever  or . This may be seen by writing the zero vector 0''X'' as  (and similarly for 0''W'') and moving the scalar 0 "outside", in front of ''B'', by linearity.The set  of all bilinear maps is a linear subspace of the space (viz. vector space, module) of all maps from  into ''X''.320px|A matrix ''M'' determines a bilinear map into the real by means of a real bilinear form , then associates of this are taken to the other three possibilities using duality and the musical isomorphismIf ''V'', ''W'', ''X'' are finite-dimensional, then so is . For , i.e. bilinear forms, the dimension of this space is  (while the space  of ''linear'' forms is of dimension ). To see this, choose a basis for ''V'' and ''W''; then each bilinear map can be uniquely represented by the matrix , and vice versa.Now, if ''X'' is a space of higher dimension, we obviously have .Examples* Matrix multiplication is a bilinear map .* If a vector space ''V'' over the real numbers '''R''' carries an inner product, then the inner product is a bilinear map .* In general, for a vector space ''V'' over a field ''F'', a bilinear form on ''V'' is the same as a bilinear map .* If ''V'' is a vector space with dual space ''V''∗, then the application operator,  is a bilinear map from  to the base field.* Let ''V'' and ''W'' be vector spaces over the same base field ''F''. If ''f'' is a member of ''V''∗ and ''g'' a member of ''W''∗, then  defines a bilinear map .* The cross product in '''R'''3 is a bilinear map .* Let  be a bilinear map, and  be a linear map, then  is a bilinear map on .See also* Tensor product* Sesquilinear form* Bilinear filtering* Multilinear map* Multilinear subspace learningExternal links*
