Amphetamine was discovered in 1887 and exists as two enantiomers: levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. ''Amphetamine'' properly refers to a specific chemical,;; the racemic free base,;; which is equal parts of the two enantiomers, levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine, in their pure amine forms. However, the term is frequently used informally to refer to any combination of the enantiomers, or to either of them alone.;; Historically, it has been used to treat nasal congestion and depression. Amphetamine is also used as a performance and cognitive enhancer, and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant. It is a prescription drug in many countries, and unauthorized possession and distribution of amphetamine are often tightly controlled due to the significant health risks associated with recreational use.The first pharmaceutical amphetamine was Benzedrine, a brand of inhalers used to treat a variety of conditions.  Currently, pharmaceutical amphetamine is prescribed as racemic amphetamine, Adderall, dextroamphetamine, or the inactive prodrug lisdexamfetamine. Amphetamine, through activation of a trace amine receptor, increases monoamine and excitatory neurotransmitter activity in the brain, with its most pronounced effects targeting the catecholamine neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine. At therapeutic doses, this causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in libido, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. It induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength.Much larger doses of amphetamine may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. Drug addiction is a serious risk with large recreational doses, but rarely arises from medical use. Very high doses can result in psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of serious side effects.Amphetamine belongs to the phenethylamine class. It is also the parent compound of its own structural class, the substituted amphetamines, which includes prominent substances such as bupropion, cathinone, MDMA (ecstasy), and methamphetamine. As a member of the phenethylamine class, amphetamine is also chemically related to the naturally occurring trace amine neuromodulators, specifically phenethylamine and ''N''-methylphenethylamine, both of which are produced within the human body. Phenethylamine is the parent compound of amphetamine, while ''N''-methylphenethylamine is a constitutional isomer that differs only in the placement of the methyl group.3UsesMedicalCurrent models of ADHD suggest that it is associated with functional impairments in some of the brain's neurotransmitter systems;"Malenka_2009_03"these functional impairments involve impaired dopamine neurotransmission in the mesocorticolimbic projection and norepinephrine neurotransmission in the locus coeruleus and prefrontal cortex."Malenka_2009_03"Psychostimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamine are effective in treating ADHD because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems."Malenka_2009"Approximately80% of those who use these stimulants see improvements in ADHD symptoms. Children with ADHD who use stimulant medications generally have better relationships with peers and family members, perform better in school, are less distractible and impulsive, and have longer attention spans. The Cochrane Collaboration's reviews on the treatment of ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults with pharmaceutical amphetamines stated that while these drugs improve short-term symptoms, they have higher discontinuation rates than non-stimulant medications due to their adverse side effects. A Cochrane Collaboration review on the treatment of ADHD in children with tic disorders such as Tourette syndrome indicated that stimulants in general do not make tics worse, but high doses of dextroamphetamine could exacerbate tics in some individuals.}};/onlyinclude;Enhancing performanceAt therapeutic doses, the adverse effects of amphetamine do not impede athletic performance;"Ergogenics""Ergogenics2""Roelands_2013"however, at much higher doses, amphetamine can induce effects that severely impair performance, such as rapid muscle breakdown and elevated body temperature."FDA Abuse ; OD""FDA Effects"}};/onlyinclude;ContraindicationsAmphetamine#Interactions;/onlyinclude;Side effectsThe side effects of amphetamine are varied, and the amount of amphetamine used is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of side effects."FDA Abuse ; OD""FDA Effects""Westfall"Amphetamine products such as Adderall, Dexedrine, and their generic equivalents are currently approved by the USFDA for long-term therapeutic use."NDCD""FDA Effects"Recreational use of amphetamine generally involves much larger doses, which have a greater risk of serious side effects than dosages used for therapeutic reasons."Westfall"Other potential side effects include acne, blurred vision, dry mouth, excessive grinding of the teeth, nosebleed, profuse sweating, rhinitis medicamentosa (drug-induced nasal congestion), reduced seizure threshold, and tics (a type of movement disorder).

Chiral resolution remains the most economical method for obtaining optically pure amphetamine on a large scale. "Gray_2007"In addition, several enantioselective syntheses of amphetamine have been developed. In one example, optically pure (''R'')-1-phenyl-ethanamine is condensed with phenylacetone to yield a chiral Schiff base.  In the key step, this intermediate is reduced by catalytic hydrogenation with a transfer of chirality to the carbon atom alpha to the amino group.  Cleavage of the benzylic amine bond by hydrogenation yields optically pure dextroamphetamine.A large number of alternative synthetic routes to amphetamine have been developed based on classic organic reactions."Allen_Ely_2009""Allen_Cantrell_1989"One example is the Friedel–Crafts reaction#Friedel–Crafts alkylation|Friedel–Crafts alkylation of chlorobenzene by allyl chloride to yield beta chloropropylbenzene which is then reacted with ammonia to produce racemic amphetamine (method 2).

In this route, allylbenzene is reacted acetonitrile in sulfuric acid to yield an organosulfate which in turn is treated with sodium hydroxide to give amphetamine via an acetamide intermediate. A third route starts with ethyl 3-oxobutanoate which through a double alkylation with methyl iodide followed by benzyl chloride can be converted into 2-methyl-3-phenyl-propanoic acid. This synthetic intermediate can be transformed into amphetamine using either a Hofmann or Curtius rearrangement (method 4).A significant number of amphetamine syntheses feature a reduction of a nitro, imine, oxime or other nitrogen-containing functional groups.

Techniques such as immunoassay, which is the most common form of amphetamine test, may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs."NAHMSA_testing"Chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine are employed to prevent false positive results."pmid15516295"Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether prescription amphetamine, prescription amphetamine prodrugs, (e.g., selegiline), over-the-counter drug products (e.g., the American version of Vicks VapoInhaler, which contains levomethamphetamine) or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several prescription drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and selegiline, among others."Amph Uses"These compounds may produce positive results for amphetamine on drug tests."pmid10711406""pmid12024689"Amphetamine is generally only detectable by a standard drug test for approximately 24hours, although a high dose may be detectable for two to four days.For the assays, a study noted that an enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT) assay for amphetamine and methamphetamine may produce more false positives than Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry#Proteomics/metabolomics|liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry."pmid16105261"Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) of amphetamine and methamphetamine with the derivatizing agent  chloride allows for the detection of methamphetamine in urine."pmid15516295"GC–MS of amphetamine and methamphetamine with the chiral derivatizing agent Mosher's acid|Mosher'sacid chloride allows for the detection of both dextroamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine in urine."pmid15516295"Hence, the latter method may be used on samples that test positive using other methods to help distinguish between the various sources of the drug."pmid15516295"History, society, and cultureHistory and culture of substituted amphetaminesAmphetamine was first synthesized in 1887 in Germany by Romanian chemist Lazăr Edeleanu who named it ''phenylisopropylamine'';"SynthHistory"its stimulant effects remained unknown until 1927, when it was independently resynthesized by Gordon Alles and reported to have sympathomimetic properties. Amphetamine had no pharmacological use until 1934, when Smith, Kline and French began selling it as an inhaler under the trade name Benzedrine as a decongestant.  During World War II, amphetamine and methamphetamine were used extensively by both the Allied and Axis forces for their stimulant and performance-enhancing effects."Vermont"As the addictive properties of the drug became known, governments began to place strict controls on the sale of amphetamine."Vermont"For example, during the early 1970s in the United States, amphetamine became a schedule II controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. In spite of strict government controls, amphetamine has been used legally or illicitly by people from a variety of backgrounds, including authors, musicians, mathematicians, and athletes."Ergogenics"Amphetamine is still illegally synthesized today in clandestine labs and sold on the black market, primarily in European countries. Among European Union (EU) member states, 1.2million young adults used illicit amphetamine or methamphetamine in 2013. During 2012, approximately 5.9metric tons of illicit amphetamine were seized within EU member states;"EMCDDA 2014"the "street price" of illicit amphetamine within the EU ranged from €6–38per gram during the same period."EMCDDA 2014"Outside Europe, the illicit market for amphetamine is much smaller than the market for methamphetamine and MDMA."WDR2014"Legal statusAs a result of the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, amphetamine became a schedule II controlled substance, as defined in the treaty, in all (183) state parties. Consequently, it is heavily regulated in most countries.  Some countries, such as South Korea and Japan, have banned substituted amphetamines even for medical use.  In other nations, such as Canada (schedule I drug), the Netherlands (List I drug), the United States (schedule II drug),"FDA Abuse ; OD"Australia (schedule 8), Thailand (category 1 narcotic), and United Kingdom (class B drug), amphetamine is in a restrictive national drug schedule that allows for its use as a medical treatment."WDR2014"Pharmaceutical productsThree currently prescribed amphetamine formulations that contain both enantiomers are Adderall, Dyanavel XR, and Evekeo, the last of which is racemic amphetamine sulfate."Amph Uses""Evekeo""Dyanavel"Amphetamine is also prescribed in enantiopure and prodrug form as dextroamphetamine and lisdexamfetamine respectively."NDCD""Vyvanse"Lisdexamfetamine is structurally different from amphetamine, and is inactive until it metabolizes into dextroamphetamine."Vyvanse"The free base of racemic amphetamine was previously available as Benzedrine, Psychedrine, and Sympatedrine."Amph Uses"Levoamphetamine was previously available as Cydril."Amph Uses"Many current amphetamine pharmaceuticals are salts due to the comparatively high volatility of the free base."Amph Uses""NDCD""EMC"Some of the current brands and their generic equivalents are listed below.;;{| style="width: 100%"|;;{| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align:center; width:500px;"|+ Amphetamine pharmaceuticals! scope="col" | Brandname! scope="col" | United States Adopted Name|UnitedStatesAdoptedName! scope="col" class="unsortable" style="text-align:center"| wikt:enantiomeric ratio|(D:L)ratioof salts! scope="col"|  Dosageform! scope="col" class="unsortable" | Marketingstartdate! scope="col" class="unsortable" | Sources;|-| Adderall || – || 3:1 ;;|| tablet || 1996 ||"Amph Uses""NDCD"|-| AdderallXR || – || 3:1 || capsule || 2001 ||"Amph Uses""NDCD"|-| DyanavelXR || amphetamine ||  || suspension || 2015 ||"Dyanavel"|-| Evekeo || amphetaminesulfate || 1:1 || tablet || 2012 |||-| Dexedrine || dextroamphetaminesulfate || 1:0 || capsule  || 1976 ||"Amph Uses""NDCD"|-| ProCentra || dextroamphetaminesulfate || 1:0 || liquid || 2010 ||"NDCD"|-| Zenzedi || dextroamphetaminesulfate || 1:0 || tablet || 2013 ||"NDCD"|-| Vyvanse || lisdexamfetaminedimesylate || 1:0|| capsule || 2007 |||}|;;{||+|-|File:Lisdexamfetamine-Structural Formula V.1.svg|thumb|left|The skeletal structure of lisdexamfetamine|alt=An image of the lisdexamfetamine compound|}|}Notes;;;Image legendReference notesReferences33emExternal links;;AmphetamineCategory:Amphetamine;;* 3007– Amphetamine* 5826– Dextroamphetamine* 32893– Levoamphetamine;;;;Molecular and cell biology;;
