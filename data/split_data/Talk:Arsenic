Needed UpdatesUnder Occurrences in Drinking water it says:"'''Low-level exposure''' to arsenic at concentrations '''found commonly in US drinking water''' compromises the initial immune response to H1N1 or swine flu infection according to NIEHS-supported scientists."I feel this needs to be clarified.  The research article [76] cited used an arsenic concentration of 100 ppb.  The WHO and U.S. EPA has upper limits of 10ppb allowed in drinking water.  The Wikipedia article either implies the 100 ppb is commonly found in US drinking water, or it misleads people into thinking that the same concentration allowed in US drinking water was used in the study.   Could someone modify the Wikipedia article to let people know that 100ppb was used in the study, or get rid of the statement about “found commonly in US drinking water.”  -Jeff Chamberlain MD  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/170.232.28.4|170.232.28.4 (talk) 22:00, 14 July 2013 (UTC);; ;;The article discusses areas of greatest contamination.

That said, people need to drink water, and many people on thisplanet will continue to consume levels above 10 parts per billion for the foreseeable future, because improving water quality is expensiveeven for wealthy nations like the United States.   It would be nice to lay the public policy issues out. For example, can we say thatthe available evidence is that reducing the arsenic from 50 ppb to 10 ppb reduces a particular cancer rate by 5 people in 10,000? And can weestimate the cost of reducing arsenic concentrations for those individuals? If we could do that, then we could make fairly direct comparisons. I believe,for example, that the health benefit return on increased mamogram screening is about one year of life for every $20,000 spent on mamograms. How does arsenic remmediationstack up in such a comparison?I believe I have included enough real information on arsenic related cancer risks so that people can get a feeling for how the research feeds in to the processof setting safe levels.At some point, I might include the bottom line -- which was an estimate of the increased lifetime risk of bladder cancerfrom drinking 10ppb As is 2 per 100,000 people. Since bladder cancer accounts for only one of several possible cancers, perhaps thecancer risk from all cancers might be 6 per 100,000 people at the 10 ppb level.The bottom line is that a person is quite unlikely to get cancer from 10ppb As.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Tombadog (talk • Special:Contributions/Tombadog|contribs) 17:45, 29 December 2007 (UTC);;; ;;Information SourcesSome of the text in this entry was rewritten from [Los Alamos National Laboratory - Arsenic].Additional text was taken directly from the Elements database 20001107 (via [dict.org]), Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913) (via [dict.org]) and WordNet (r) 1.7 (via [dict.org]).Data for the table was obtained from the sources listed on the main page and Wikipedia:WikiProject Elements but was reformatted and converted into SI units.------TalkMilitary use not included yet - Lewisite ; WW I, specifically.------The knowledge that Wisconsin inhabitants have a greater risk of catching the swine flu because 20% of their wells might have a slightly increased arsenic content just makes a whole picture now.

Please take a moment to review . If necessary, add cbignore after the link to keep me from modifying it. Alternatively, you can add  to keep me off the page altogether. I made the following changes:*Attempted to fix sourcing forCheers.—User:Cyberbot II|cyberbot IIUser talk:Cyberbot II|Talk to my owner:Online;18:08, 13 July 2015 (UTC)US centricI see that people have been mentioning this on the the talk page for years, but apparently nothing has been done about it. "Wood preservation in the US" seems to suggest that chromated copper arsenate is only used for wood preservation...well, in the US. No, it's been used for that purpose all over the world for quite some time now. The US is one of the first to BAN its use, but that is not what the section suggests. It also seems to have been written by someone with an agenda against the use of CCA; it's tone and claims are overly negative when compared with the same topics discussed on CCA, which seems to suggest that the dangers of arsenic leaching are relatively minimal. It says that tests have shown that it depends greatly on the type of wood and the type of soil, but seepage is usually very small, and in most "normal" soils, the arsenic bonds with the molecules in the soil, rendering it inert to organisms. As for burning it, the page also specifically says that it's only a real hazard when burned indoors, in confined areas. "Gasp! But the EPA '''''banned''''' it!!!" O.O Yes, because the EPA is first and foremost a political organization who is more than happy to allow dangerous materials if the lobbyists put the money in the right spot, while busily banning minor things that aren't really a danger, yet which will keep the misinformed public happy that they are doing something, and therefore paying their budget and their salaries.The section on "military uses" likewise seems to suggest that only the US has ever used arsenic in weapons projects, which is utterly ridiculous. To lie by omission is still lying, and I can't tell if this person simply didn't bother to find out that other nations were just as involved, or if they were specifically trying to make the US look like a heinous beast for using such a nasty chemical on its enemies. Either way, it's not very professional..45Colt 05:07, 12 November 2015 (UTC)Toxicity_in_animals - no human?While i'm sure we don't want to sound like a poisoner's recipe book, i would assume the historical popularity of arsenic as a poison would mean we'd at least have a pretty good estimate for a "human" row in this section. No? In fact, arsenic poisoning says "The acute minimal lethal dose of arsenic in adults is estimated to be 70 to 200 mg or 1 mg/kg/day." --User:Rob*|Rob* (User talk:Rob*|talk) 02:11, 7 December 2015 (UTC)An omitted now-important use of arsenic.Arsenic, in the form of Gallium Arsenic Phosphide, is used as the active material in red Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). It was the the first, and for a long time the only, coloured LED made.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/101.161.4.233|101.161.4.233 (talk) 08:37, 22 January 2016 (UTC);;; ;;
