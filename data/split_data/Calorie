Calorie (disambiguation)The name '''calorie''' is used for two units of energy.* The '''small calorie''' or '''gram calorie''' (symbol: '''cal''') is the approximate amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius at a pressure of one atmosphere.Webster* The '''kilocalorie''', also known as '''large calorie''', '''kilogram calorie''', '''food calorie''', and similar names (symbols: '''kcal''', '''Cal''' or '''C''') is 1000 small calories.WebsterAlthough these units are part of the metric system, they have been superseded in the International System of Units by the joule.  One small calorie is approximately;; 4.2 joules (so one large calorie is about 4.2 kilojoules). The factor used to convert calories to joules at a given temperature is numerically equivalent to the specific heat capacity of water expressed in joules per kelvin per gram or per kilogram. The precise conversion factor depends on the definition adopted.In spite of its non-official status, the large calorie is still widely used as a unit of food energy. The small calorie is also often used for measurements in chemistry, although the amounts involved are typically recorded in kilocalories.The calorie was first defined by Nicolas Clément in 1824 as a unit of heat energy,Histand entered French and English dictionaries between 1841 and 1867. The word comes from Latin ''calor'' meaning "heat".DefinitionsThe energy needed to increase the temperature of a given mass of water by 1°C depends on the atmospheric pressure and the starting temperature. Accordingly, several different precise definitions of the calorie have been used.The pressure is usually taken to be the standard atmospheric pressure (). The temperature increase can be expressed as one kelvin, which means the same as an increment of one degree Celsius.{|class=wikitable|-! Name !! Symbol !! Conversions !!

Until 1948, the latter was defined as 4.1833 international joules; the current standard of 4.184 J was chosen to have the new thermochemical calorie represent the same quantity of energy as before."Rossini"The calorie was first defined specifically to measure energy in the form of heat, especially in experimental calorimetry.NutritionFood energyIn nutritional contexts, the kilojoule (kJ) is the SI unit of food energy, although the kilocalorie is still in common use. In these contexts, confusingly, the word ''calorie'' is very often used for what is actually a kilocalorie of nutritional energy. Sometimes, in an attempt to avoid confusion, it is written ''Calorie'' (with a capital "C") in an attempt to make the distinction, although this is not universal, and is not widely understood; moreover, it goes against the convention that unit names, also of derived units, start with a lowercase letter in English.In attempts to facilitate comparison, specific energy or energy density figures are often quoted, for example "calories per serving" or "kilocalories per 100g". Nutritional requirements or intakes are often expressed in calories per day. One gram of fat in a food has 9 kilocalories, carbohydrates and protein have approximately 4 kilocalories per gram each. Alcohol in a food makes for 7 kilocalories per gram.ChemistryIn other scientific contexts, the term ''calorie'' almost always refers to the small calorie. Even though it is not an SI unit, it is still used in chemistry. For example, the energy released in a chemical reaction per mole of reagent is occasionally expressed in kilocalories per mole.ZviTypically, this use was largely due to the ease with which it could be calculated in laboratory reactions, especially in aqueous solution: a volume of reagent dissolved in water forming a solution, with concentration expressed in moles per liter (1 liter weighing 1kg), will induce a temperature change in degrees Celsius in the total volume of water solvent, and these quantities (volume, molar concentration and temperature change) can then be used to calculate energy per mole. It is also occasionally used to specify energy quantities that relate to reaction energy, such as enthalpy of formation and the size of activation barriers. However, its use is being superseded by the SI unit, the joule, and multiples thereof such as the kilojoule.See also2* Basal metabolic rate* Caloric theory* Conversion of units of energy* Empty calorie* Food energy* Frigorie* Nutrition facts labelReferencesMerriam-Webster's Online Dictionary Def 1aZvi Rappoport ed.
