I have also cleared up the status.

Because of this, I've changed a few pronouns.  I have also removed the words "at cost" since we don't really know how the price is set. There was an iPhone link in the EL's.

Three quite striking examples are:* Geoscience Australia gives the area of Australia as 7 692 024 square km  whereas the CIA Factbook gives 7,682,300 sq km. The difference is greater than the area of Cyprus!* The French Government gives the area of France as 543,965 sq km  whereas the CIA gives France  7,535 sq km more (551,500 sq km ). That's an extra area that is close to the size of Corsica!* New Zealand Travel gives the area of New Zealand as 266,200 sq km  whereas the CIA Factbook gives 267,710 sq km . That's a difference of more than 1,500 sq km.{| class="wikitable"|-! Country! CIA Area!

Michael Glass (talk) 01:34, 31 October 2010 (UTC) However, in other cases, for instance, Canada, Denmark, Belgium and South Africa, the figures are the same. Michael Glass (talk) 07:13, 15 November 2010 (UTC):7,692,024/7,682,300 = 0.12% difference. That's pretty good. The only thing that citing Cyprus points out is how big the relative difference between the two countries is, that a miniscule error in the calculation of Australia's size is larger than it. 543,965/551,500 = 1.38%. Quite a bit larger, but not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. Again, the only thing that citing a small piece of land does is emphasize the relative difference in size. 267,710/266,200 = 0.56% - not quite as good as Australia's, but quite close nonetheless.:I really don't see what your point here is. It's impossible to get a 100% correct estimation of the size of a country. For one thing, estimating the area of a country involves estimating the size and position of its borders. Borders based on coastlines and any natural features like rivers have fractal properties, and are thus are subject to the coastline paradox. This means the final total length changes depending on what feature size you choose to measure with. A smaller one will produce a longer length, a larger feature size a shorter one. There is no right or wrong feature size, you have to pick one and stick with it. And once you arrive at these different, equally valid outlines, the measured area that they can be said to enclose will also be different, and equally valid. The difference is small enough that its safe to assume that they are the result of legitimate variances in equally valid but different methods of measurement, like this, and not simply gross mismanagement on the side of one party (assumed to be the CIA by you).Special:Contributions/108.131.78.178|108.131.78.178 (talk) 10:26, 11 October 2014 (UTC):I see no reason to assume those other sources are more accurate.

The section on the number of settlers in Israel is more important. The stinging criticism of Chuck Holmes, foreign director of the US National Public Radio is worth recording. However, I think the article would benefit from another independent and authoritative estimate of the numbers. For example, the number given by the State Department is 250,000 Jews in the West Bank and an additional 180,000 in East Jerusalem . At the moment the CIA Factbook says that the population figures  for the West Bank are being reviewed, .:In all, I believe that the wording could be examined and revised, but I don't think that there is anything wrong in principle, about criticising the accuracy of the CIA Factbook.
