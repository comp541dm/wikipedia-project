British Museum (disambiguation)The centre of the museum was redeveloped in 2001 to become the Great Court, surrounding the original Reading Room.The '''British Museum''' is a museum dedicated to human history, art, and culture, located in the Bloomsbury area of London.Its permanent collection, numbering some 8 million works, is among the  largest and most comprehensive in existence"britishmuseum.org"and originates from all continents, illustrating and documenting the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present.noneThe British Museum was established in 1753, largely based on the collections of the physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane. The museum first opened to the public on 15 January 1759, in Montagu House in Bloomsbury, on the site of the current museum building. Its expansion over the following two and a half centuries was largely a result of an expanding British colonial footprint and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions, the first being the British Museum (Natural History) in South Kensington in 1881. Some objects in the collection, most notably the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon, are the objects of controversy and of calls for restitution to their countries of origin.Until 1997, when the British Library (previously centred on the Round Reading Room) moved to a new site, the British Museum housed both a national museum of antiquities and a national library in the same building. The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and as with all other national museums in the United Kingdom it charges no admission fee, except for loan exhibitions. Neil MacGregor became director of the museum in August 2002, succeeding Robert G. W. Anderson. In April 2015, MacGregor announced that he would step-down as Director on 15 December. On 29 September 2015, the Board of Trustees confirmed Hartwig Fischer, who will assume his post in Spring 2016, as his successor.HistoryHans Sloane, founder of the British MuseumFile:Sir Hans Sloane, an engraving from a portrait by T. Murray.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir Hans SloaneAlthough today principally a museum of cultural art objects and antiquities, the British Museum was founded as a "universal museum". Its foundations lie in the will of the Irish-born British physician and naturalist Sir Hans Sloane (1660–1753). During the course of his lifetime Sloane gathered an enviable collection of curiosities and, not wishing to see his collection broken up after death, he bequeathed it to King George II, for the nation, for a sum of £20,000.At that time, Sloane's collection consisted of around 71,000 objects of all kinds including some 40,000 printed books, 7,000 manuscripts, extensive natural history specimens including 337 volumes of dried plants, prints and drawings including those by Albrecht Dürer and antiquities from Sudan, Egypt, Greece, Rome, the Ancient Near and Far East and the Americas.Foundation (1753)On 7 June 1753, King George II gave his formal assent to the Act of Parliament which established the British Museum.none The British Museum Act 1753 also added two other libraries to the Sloane collection, namely the Cottonian Library, assembled by Sir Robert Cotton, dated back to Elizabethan times and the Harleian library, the collection of the Earls of Oxford. They were joined in 1757 by the Royal Library, assembled by various British monarchs. Together these four "foundation collections" included many of the most treasured books now in the British Library including the Lindisfarne Gospels and the sole surviving copy of ''Beowulf''.noneMontagu House, c. 1715The British Museum was the first of a new kind of museum – national, belonging to neither church nor king, freely open to the public and aiming to collect everything. Sloane's collection, while including a vast miscellany of objects, tended to reflect his scientific interests. The addition of the Cotton and Harley manuscripts introduced a literary and antiquarian element and meant that the British Museum now became both National Museum and library.Cabinet of curiosities (1753–78)File:Rosetta Stone International Congress of Orientalists ILN 1874.jpg|thumb|The Rosetta Stone on display in the British Museum in 1874The body of trustees decided on a converted 17th-century mansion, Montagu House, as a location for the museum, which it bought from the Montagu family for £20,000. The Trustees rejected Buckingham House, on the site now occupied by Buckingham Palace, on the grounds of cost and the unsuitability of its location.noneWith the acquisition of Montagu House the first exhibition galleries and reading room for scholars opened on 15 January 1759. In 1757, King George II gave the Old Royal Library and with it the right to a copy of every book published in the country, thereby ensuring that the Museum's library would expand indefinitely. During the few years after its foundation the British Museum received several further gifts, including the Thomason Collection of Civil War Tracts and David Garrick's library of 1,000 printed plays. The predominance of natural history, books and manuscripts began to lessen when in 1772 the Museum acquired for £8,400 its first significant antiquities in Sir William Hamilton's "first" collection of Greek vases.[BM, "Portrait plaque of Sir William Hamilton"] British MuseumIndolence and energy (1778–1800)From 1778, a display of objects from the South Seas brought back from the round-the-world voyages of Captain James Cook and the travels of other explorers fascinated visitors with a glimpse of previously unknown lands. The bequest of a collection of books, engraved gems, coins, prints and drawings by Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode in 1800 did much to raise the Museum's reputation; but Montagu House became increasingly crowded and decrepit and it was apparent that it would be unable to cope with further expansion.BMCE1/5, 1175 (13 May 1820). Minutes of General Meeting of the Trustees, 1754–63. (Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History, p. 78)The museum’s first notable addition towards its collection of antiquities, since its foundation, was by Sir William Hamilton (1730–1803), British Ambassador to Naples, who sold his collection of Greek and Roman artefacts to the museum in 1784 together with a number of other antiquities and natural history specimens. A list of donations to the Museum, dated 31 January 1784, refers to the Hamilton bequest of a "Colossal Foot of an Apollo in Marble". It was one of two antiquities of Hamilton's collection drawn for him by Francesco Progenie, a pupil of Pietro Fabris, who also contributed a number of drawings of Mount Vesuvius sent by Hamilton to the Royal Society in London.Growth and change (1800–25)The Elgin Room, 1937Left to Right: Montagu House, Townley Gallery and Sir Robert Smirke's west wing under construction, July 1828The Mausoleum of Halicarnassus Room, 1920sIn the early 19th century the foundations for the extensive collection of sculpture began to be laid and Greek, Roman and Egyptian artefacts dominated the antiquities displays. After the defeat of the French campaign in the Battle of the Nile, in 1801, the British Museum acquired more Egyptian sculptures and in 1802 King George III presented the Rosetta Stone – key to the deciphering of hieroglyphs.''Wondrous Curiosities – Ancient Egypt at the British Museum'', pp. 66–72 (Stephanie Moser, 2006, ISBN 0-226-54209-2) Gifts and purchases from Henry Salt, British consul general in Egypt, beginning with the Colossal bust of Ramesses II in 1818, laid the foundations of the collection of Egyptian Monumental Sculpture. Many Greek sculptures followed, notably the first purpose-built exhibition space, the Charles Towneley collection, much of it Roman Sculpture, in 1805. In 1806, Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin, ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799 to 1803 removed the large collection of marble sculptures from the Parthenon, on the Acropolis in Athens and transferred them to the UK. In 1816 these masterpieces of western art, were acquired by The British Museum by Act of Parliament and deposited in the museum thereafter.The British Museum – The Elgin Marbles, p. 85 (B.F.Cook, 2005, ISBN 0-7141-2134-7 The collections were supplemented by the Bassae frieze from Phigaleia, Greece in 1815. The Ancient Near Eastern collection also had its beginnings in 1825 with the purchase of Assyrian and Babylonian antiquities from the widow of Claudius James Rich.The British Museum – Assyrian Sculpture, pp. 6–7 (Julian Reade, 2004, ISBN 0-7141-2141-X)In 1802 a Buildings Committee was set-up to plan for expansion of the museum, and further highlighted by the donation in 1822 of the King's Library, personal library of King George III's, comprising 65,000 volumes, 19,000 pamphlets, maps, charts and topographical drawings. The neoclassical architect, Sir Robert Smirke, was asked to draw up plans for an eastern extension to the Museum "...for the reception of the Royal Library, and a Picture Gallery over it ..." and put forward plans for today's quadrangular building, much of which can be seen today. The dilapidated Old Montagu House was demolished and work on the King's Library Gallery began in 1823. The extension, the East Wing, was completed by 1831. However, following the founding of the National Gallery, London in 1824,none the proposed Picture Gallery was no longer needed, and the space on the upper floor was given over to the Natural history collections.The largest building site in Europe (1825–50)The Grenville Library, 1875The Museum became a construction site as Sir Robert Smirke's grand neo-classical building gradually arose. The King's Library, on the ground floor of the East Wing, was handed over in 1827, and was described as one of the finest rooms in London. Although it was not fully open to the general public until 1857, special openings were arranged during The Great Exhibition of 1851. In spite of dirt and disruption the collections grew, outpacing the new building.In 1840, the Museum became involved in its first overseas excavations, Charles Fellows's expedition to Xanthos, in Asia Minor, whence came remains of the tombs of the rulers of ancient Lycia, among them the Nereid and Payava monuments. In 1857, Charles Newton was to discover the 4th-century BC Mausoleum of Halikarnassos, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. In the 1840s and 1850s the Museum supported excavations in Assyria by A.H. Layard and others at sites such as Nimrud and Nineveh. Of particular interest to curators was the eventual discovery of Ashurbanipal's great library of cuneiform tablets, which helped to make the Museum a focus for Assyrian studies.Sir Thomas Grenville (1755–1846), a Trustee of The British Museum from 1830, assembled a library of 20,240 volumes, which he left to the Museum in his will. The books arrived in January 1847 in twenty-one horse-drawn vans. The only vacant space for this large library was a room originally intended for manuscripts, between the Front Entrance Hall and the Manuscript Saloon. The books remained here until the British Library moved to St Pancras in 1998.Collecting from the wider world (1850–75)The opening of the forecourt in 1852 marked the completion of Robert Smirke's 1823 plan, but already adjustments were having to be made to cope with the unforeseen growth of the collections. Infill galleries were constructed for Assyrian sculptures and Sydney Smirke's Round Reading Room, with space for a million books, opened in 1857. Because of continued pressure on space the decision was taken to move natural history to a new building in South Kensington, which would later become the British Museum (Natural History).Roughly contemporary with the construction of the new building was the career of a man sometimes called the "second founder" of the British Museum, the Italian librarian Anthony Panizzi. Under his supervision, the British Museum Library (now part of the British Library) quintupled in size and became a well-organised institution worthy of being called a national library, the largest library in the world after the National Library of Paris."world and its people"The quadrangle at the centre of Smirke's design proved to be a waste of valuable space and was filled at Panizzi's request by a circular Reading Room of cast iron, designed by Smirke's brother, Sydney Smirke.Until the mid-19th century, the Museum's collections were relatively circumscribed but, in 1851, with the appointment to the staff of Augustus Wollaston Franks to curate the collections, the Museum began for the first time to collect British and European medieval antiquities, prehistory, branching out into Asia and diversifying its holdings of ethnography. A real coup for the museum was the purchase in 1867, over French objections, of the Duke of Blacas's wide-ranging and valuable collection of antiquities. Overseas excavations continued and John Turtle Wood discovered the remains of the 4th century BC Temple of Artemis at Ephesos, another Wonder of the Ancient World.South from Ephesus – An Escape From The Tyranny of Western Art, pp. 33–34,(Brian Sewell, 2002, ISBN 1-903933-16-1)Scholarship and legacies (1875–1900)File:Брытанскі музей 2014 27.JPG|thumb|250px|Display case of Renaissance metalware from the Waddesdon Bequest, 2014The natural history collections were an integral part of the British Museum until their removal to the new British Museum (Natural History), now the Natural History Museum, in 1887. With the departure and the completion of the new White Wing (fronting Montague Street) in 1884, more space was available for antiquities and ethnography and the library could further expand. This was a time of innovation as electric lighting was introduced in the Reading Room and exhibition galleries.The William Burges collection of armoury was bequeathed to the museum in 1881. In 1882, the Museum was involved in the establishment of the independent Egypt Exploration Fund (now Society) the first British body to carry out research in Egypt. A bequest from Miss Emma Turner in 1892 financed excavations in Cyprus. In 1897 the death of the great collector and curator, A.W. Franks, was followed by an immense bequest of 3,300 finger rings, 153 drinking vessels, 512 pieces of continental porcelain, 1,500 netsuke, 850 inro, over 30,000 bookplates and miscellaneous items of jewellery and plate, among them the Oxus Treasure.In 1898 Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild bequeathed the Waddesdon Bequest, the glittering contents from his New Smoking Room at Waddesdon Manor. This consisted of almost 300 pieces of ''objets d'art et de vertu'' which included exquisite examples of jewellery, plate, enamel, carvings, glass and maiolica, among them the Holy Thorn Reliquary, probably created in the 1390s in Paris for John, Duke of Berry. The collection was in the tradition of a schatzkammer or treasure house such as those formed by the Renaissance princes of Europe. Baron Ferdinand's will was most specific, and failure to observe the terms would make it void, the collection should beThese terms are still observed, and the collection occupies room 45, although it will move to new quarters in 2015.New century, new building (1900–25)File:England; London - The British Museum, Archive King Edward VII's Galleries ~ North Wing (1914).2.jpg|thumb|Opening of The North Wing, King Edward VII's Galleries, 1914File:Woolley holding the hardened plaster mold of a lyre.jpg|thumb|Sir Leonard Woolley holding the excavated Sumerian Queen's Lyre, 1922By the last years of the 19th century, The British Museum's collections had increased so much that the Museum building was no longer big enough for them. In 1895 the trustees purchased the 69 houses surrounding the Museum with the intention of demolishing them and building around the West, North and East sides of the Museum. The first stage was the construction of the northern wing beginning 1906.All the while, the collections kept growing. Emil Torday collected in Central Africa, Aurel Stein in Central Asia, D.G. Hogarth, Leonard Woolley and T. E. Lawrence excavated at Carchemish. Around this time, the American collector and philanthropist J Pierpont Morgan donated a substantial number of objects to the museum, including William Greenwell's collection of prehistoric artefacts from across Europe which he had purchased for £10,000 in 1908. Morgan had also acquired a major part of Sir John Evans's coin collection, which was later sold to the museum by his son John Pierpont Morgan Junior in 1915. In 1918, because of the threat of wartime bombing, some objects were evacuated to a Postal Tube Railway at Holborn, the National Library of Wales (Aberystwyth) and a country house near Malvern. On the return of antiquities from wartime storage in 1919 some objects were found to have deteriorated. A temporary conservation laboratory was set up in May 1920 and became a permanent department in 1931. It is today the oldest in continuous existence.Permanent establishment of the Research Laboratory (now the oldest such establishment in continuous existence)  In 1923, the British Museum welcomed over one million visitors.Disruption and reconstruction (1925–50)New mezzanine floors were constructed and book stacks rebuilt in an attempt to cope with the flood of books. In 1931, the art dealer Sir Joseph Duveen offered funds to build a gallery for the Parthenon sculptures. Designed by the American architect John Russell Pope, it was completed in 1938. The appearance of the exhibition galleries began to change as dark Victorian reds gave way to modern pastel shades.none However, in August 1939, due to the imminence of war and the likelihood of air-raids the Parthenon Sculptures along with Museum's most valued collections were dispersed to secure basements, country house, Aldwych tube station, the National Library of Wales and a quarry. The evacuation was timely, for in 1940 the Duveen Gallery was severely damaged by bombing. The Museum continued to collect from all countries and all centuries: among the most spectacular additions were the 2600 BC Mesopotamian treasure from Ur, discovered during Leonard Woolley's 1922–34 excavations. Gold, silver and garnet grave goods from the Anglo-Saxon ship burial at Sutton Hoo (1939) and late Roman silver tableware from Mildenhall, Suffolk (1946). The immediate post-war years were taken up with the return of the collections from protection and the restoration of the museum after the Blitz. Work also began on restoring the damaged Duveen Gallery.A new public face (1950–75)The re-opened Duveen Gallery, 1980In 1953, the Museum celebrated its bicentenary. Many changes followed: the first full-time in house designer and publications officer were appointed in 1964, A Friends organisation was set up in 1968, an Education Service established in 1970 and publishing house in 1973. In 1963, a new Act of Parliament introduced administrative reforms. It became easier to lend objects, the constitution of the Board of Trustees changed and the Natural History Museum became fully independent. By 1959 the Coins and Medals office suite, completely destroyed during the war, was rebuilt and re-opened, attention turned towards the gallery work with new tastes in design leading to the remodelling of Robert Smirke's Classical and Near Eastern galleries. In 1962 the Duveen Gallery was finally restored and the Parthenon Sculptures were moved back into it, once again at the heart of the museum.noneBy the 1970s the Museum was again expanding. More services for the public were introduced; visitor numbers soared, with the temporary exhibition "Treasures of Tutankhamun" in 1972, attracting 1,694,117 visitors, the most successful in British history. In the same year the Act of Parliament establishing the British Library was passed, separating the collection of manuscripts and printed books from the British Museum. This left the Museum with antiquities; coins, medals and paper money; prints ; drawings; and ethnography. A pressing problem was finding space for additions to the library which now required an extra 14 miles of shelving each year. The Government suggested a site at St Pancras for the new British Library but the books did not leave the museum until 1997.The Great Court emerges (1975–2000)The departure of the British Library to a new site at St Pancras, finally achieved in 1998, provided the space needed for the books. It also created the opportunity to redevelop the vacant space in Robert Smirke's 19th-century central quadrangle into the Queen Elizabeth II Great Court – the largest covered square in Europe – which opened in 2000. The ethnography collections, which had been housed in the short-lived Museum of Mankind at 6 Burlington Gardens from 1970, were returned to new purpose-built galleries in the museum in 2000.The Museum again readjusted its collecting policies as interest in "modern" objects: prints, drawings, medals and the decorative arts reawakened. Ethnographical fieldwork was carried out in places as diverse as New Guinea, Madagascar, Romania, Guatemala and Indonesia and there were excavations in the Near East, Egypt, Sudan and the UK. The Weston Gallery of Roman Britain, opened in 1997, displayed a number of recently discovered hoards which demonstrated the richness of what had been considered an unimportant part of the Roman Empire. The Museum turned increasingly towards private funds for buildings, acquisitions and other purposes.The British Museum todayFile:BP Lecture Theatre British Museum (3).jpg|thumbnail|right|The BP Lecture Theatre at the museum, part of the Clore Centre for Education, 2013Today the museum no longer houses collections of natural history, and the books and manuscripts it once held now form part of the independent British Library. The Museum nevertheless preserves its universality in its collections of artefacts representing the cultures of the world, ancient and modern. The original 1753 collection has grown to over thirteen million objects at the British Museum, 70 million at the Natural History Museum and 150 million at the British Library.The Round Reading Room, which was designed by the architect Sydney Smirke, opened in 1857. For almost 150 years researchers came here to consult the Museum's vast library. The Reading Room closed in 1997 when the national library (the British Library) moved to a new building at St Pancras. Today it has been transformed into the Walter and Leonore Annenberg Centre.With the bookstacks in the central courtyard of the museum empty, the process of demolition for Lord Foster's glass-roofed Great Court could begin. The Great Court, opened in 2000, while undoubtedly improving circulation around the museum, was criticised for having a lack of exhibition space at a time when the museum was in serious financial difficulties and many galleries were closed to the public. At the same time the African collections that had been temporarily housed in 6 Burlington Gardens were given a new gallery in the North Wing funded by the Sainsbury family – with the donation valued at £25 million.As part of its very large website, the museum has the largest online database of objects in the collection of any museum in the world, with 2,000,000 individual object entries, 650,000 of them illustrated, online at the start of 2012. There is also a "Highlights" database with longer entries on over 4,000 objects, and several specialised online research catalogues and online journals (all free to access).[Highlights] British Museum, [online research catalogues] British Museum and [online journals] British Museum In 2013 the museum's website received 19.5 millions visits, an increase of 47% from the previous year.BBC_museum#In 2013 the museum received a record 6.7 million visitors, an increase of 20% from the previous year. Popular exhibitions including "Life and Death in Pompeii and Herculaneum" and "Ice Age Art" are credited with helping fuel the increase in visitors. Plans were announced in September 2014 to recreate the entire building along with all exhibits in the video game ''Minecraft'' in conjunction with members of the public.GovernanceThe British Museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport through a three-year funding agreement. Its head is the Director. The British Museum was run from its inception by a 'Principal Librarian' (when the book collections were still part of the Museum), a role that was renamed 'Director and Principal Librarian' in 1898, and 'Director' in 1973 (on the separation of the British Library).A board of 25 trustees (with the Director as their accounting officer for the purposes of reporting to Government) is responsible for the general management and control of the Museum, in accordance with the British Museum Act 1963 and the Museums and Galleries Act 1992. Prior to the 1963 Act, it was chaired by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker of the House of Commons. The board was formed on the Museum's inception to hold its collections in trust for the nation without actually owning them themselves, and now fulfil a mainly advisory role. Trustee appointments are governed by the regulatory framework set out in the code of practice on public appointments issued by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments.BuildingFile:British museum entrance.jpg|thumb|The main entrance to the museum, with Greek temple style portico.The Greek Revival façade facing Great Russell Street is a characteristic building of Sir Robert Smirke, with 44 columns in the Ionic order  high, closely based on those of the temple of Athena Polias at Priene in Asia Minor. The pediment over the main entrance is decorated by sculptures by Sir Richard Westmacott depicting ''The Progress of Civilisation'', consisting of fifteen allegorical figures, installed in 1852.The construction commenced around the courtyard with the East Wing (The King's Library) in 1823–1828, followed by the North Wing in 1833–1838, which originally housed among other galleries a reading room, now the Wellcome Gallery. Work was also progressing on the northern half of the West Wing (The Egyptian Sculpture Gallery) 1826–1831, with Montagu House demolished in 1842 to make room for the final part of the West Wing, completed in 1846, and the South Wing with its great colonnade, initiated in 1843 and completed in 1847, when the Front Hall and Great Staircase were opened to the public.Building the British Museum, Marjorie Caygill ; Christopher Date 1999 The Museum is faced with Portland stone, but the perimeter walls and other parts of the building were built using Haytor granite from Dartmoor in South Devon, transported via the unique Haytor Granite Tramway.File:BM; 'MF' RM1 - The King's Library, Enlightenment 1 'Discovering the world in the 18th Century ~ View South.jpg|The Enlightenment Gallery at museum, which formerly held the King's Library, 2007|thumb|leftIn 1846 Robert Smirke was replaced as the Museum's architect by his brother Sydney Smirke, whose major addition was the Round Reading Room 1854–1857; at m in diameter it was then the second widest dome in the world, the Pantheon in Rome being slightly wider.The next major addition was the White Wing 1882–1884 added behind the eastern end of the South Front, the architect being Sir John Taylor.In 1895, Parliament gave the Museum Trustees a loan of £200,000 to purchase from the Duke of Bedford all 69 houses which backed onto the Museum building in the five surrounding streets – Great Russell Street, Montague Street, Montague Place, Bedford Square and Bloomsbury Street. The Trustees planned to demolish these houses and to build around the West, North and East sides of the Museum new galleries that would completely fill the block on which the Museum stands. The architect Sir John James Burnet was petitioned to put forward ambitious long-term plans to extend the building on all three sides. Most of the houses in Montague Place were knocked down a few years after the sale. Of this grand plan only the Edward VII galleries in the centre of the North Front were ever constructed, these were built 1906–14 to the design by J.J. Burnet, and opened by King George V and Queen Mary in 1914. They now house the Museum's collections of Prints and Drawings and Oriental Antiquities. There was not enough money to put up more new buildings, and so the houses in the other streets are nearly all still standing.File:BM; Archives - Impression of the proposed extension.jpg|thumb|left|Proposed British Museum Extension, 1906The Reading Room and Great Court roof, 2005The Duveen Gallery, sited to the west of the Egyptian, Greek ; Assyrian sculpture galleries, was designed to house the Elgin Marbles by the American Beaux-Arts architect John Russell Pope.

Other areas damaged during World War II bombing included: in September 1940 two unexploded bombs hit the Edward VII galleries, the King's Library received a direct hit from a high explosive bomb, incendiaries fell on the dome of the Round Reading Room but did little damage; on the night of 10 to 11 May 1941 several incendiaries fell on the south west corner of the Museum, destroying the book stack and 150,000 books in the courtyard and the galleries around the top of the Great Staircase – this damage was not fully repaired until the early 1960s.pp. 65–66, Building the British Museum, Marjorie Caygill ; Christopher Date 1999The Queen Elizabeth II Great Court is a covered square at the centre of the British Museum designed by the engineers Buro Happold and the architects Foster and Partners.Norman Foster and the British Museum, Norman Foster, Deyan Sudjic ; Spencer de Grey 2001 The Great Court opened in December 2000 and is the largest covered square in Europe.

There are nearly one hundred galleries open to the public, representing km of exhibition space, although the less popular ones have restricted opening times. However, the lack of a large temporary exhibition space has led to the £135 million World Conservation and Exhibition Centre to provide one and to concentrate all the Museum's conservation facilities into one Conservation Centre. This project was announced in July 2007, with the architects Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners. It was granted planning permission in December 2009 and was completed in time for the Viking exhibition in March 2014.Blythe House in West Kensington is used by the Museum for off-site storage of small and medium-sized artefacts, and Franks House in East London is used for storage and work on the "Early Prehistory" – Palaeolithic and Mesolithic – and some other collections.DepartmentsDepartment of Ancient Egypt and SudanFile:England; London - The British Museum, Egypt Egyptian Sculpture ~ Colossal granite head of Amenhotep III (Room 4).2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Room 4 – Colossal red granite statue of Amenhotep III, 1350 BCThe British Museum houses the world's largestnone and most comprehensive collection of Egyptian antiquities (with over 100,000 pieces) outside the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. A collection of immense importance for its range and quality, it includes objects of all periods from virtually every site of importance in Egypt and the Sudan. Together, they illustrate every aspect of the cultures of the Nile Valley (including Nubia), from the Predynastic Neolithic period (c. 10,000 BC) through to the Coptic (Christian) times (12th century AD), a time-span over 11,000 years.Egyptian antiquities have formed part of the British Museum collection ever since its foundation in 1753 after receiving 160 Egyptian objects from Sir Hans Sloane. After the defeat of the French forces under Napoleon at the Battle of the Nile in 1801, the Egyptian antiquities collected were confiscated by the British army and presented to the British Museum in 1803. These works, which included the famed Rosetta Stone, were the first important group of large sculptures to be acquired by the Museum. Thereafter, the UK appointed Henry Salt as consul in Egypt who amassed a huge collection of antiquities, some of which were assembled and transported with great ingenuity by the famous Italian explorer Giovanni Belzoni. Most of the antiquities Salt collected were purchased by the British Museum and the Musée du Louvre.By 1866 the collection consisted of some 10,000 objects. Antiquities from excavations started to come to the museum in the latter part of the 19th century as a result of the work of the Egypt Exploration Fund under the efforts of E.A. Wallis Budge. Over the years more than 11,000 objects came from this source, including pieces from Amarna, Bubastis and Deir el-Bahari. Other organisations and individuals also excavated and donated objects to the British Museum, including Flinders Petrie's Egypt Research Account and the British School of Archaeology in Egypt, as well as the Oxford University Expedition to Kawa and Faras in Sudan.File:Egypt Gallery British Museum.jpg|thumb|250px|Room 4 – Colossal bust of Ramesses II, the 'Younger Memnon', 1250 BCFile:Room 63 British Museum.jpg|thumb|250px|Room 63 – Mummies on display in the Egyptian Death and Afterlife GalleriesActive support by the museum for excavations in Egypt continued to result in important acquisitions throughout the 20th century until changes in antiquities laws in Egypt led to the suspension of policies allowing finds to be exported, although divisions still continue in Sudan. The British Museum conducted its own excavations in Egypt where it received divisions of finds, including Asyut (1907), Mostagedda and Matmar (1920s), Ashmunein (1980s) and sites in Sudan such as Soba, Kawa and the Northern Dongola Reach (1990s). The size of the Egyptian collections now stand at over 110,000 objects.In autumn 2001 the eight million objects forming the Museum's permanent collection were further expanded by the addition of six million objects from the Wendorf Collection of Egyptian and Sudanese Prehistory. These were donated by Professor Fred Wendorf of Southern Methodist University in Texas, and comprise the entire collection of artefacts and environmental remains from his excavations at Prehistoric sites in the Sahara Desert between 1963 and 1997. Other fieldwork collections have recently come from Dietrich and Rosemarie Klemm (University of Munich) and William Adams (University of Kentucky).The seven permanent Egyptian galleries at the British Museum, which include its largest exhibition space (Room 4, for monumental sculpture), can display only 4% of its Egyptian holdings. The second-floor galleries have a selection of the museum's collection of 140 mummies and coffins, the largest outside Cairo. A high proportion of the collection comes from tombs or contexts associated with the cult of the dead, and it is these pieces, in particular the mummies, that remain among the most eagerly sought after exhibits by visitors to the museum.Key highlights of the collections include:'''Predynastic and Early Dynastic period (c. 6000 BC – c. 2690 BC)'''*Mummy of ''Ginger'' from Gebelein, (c. 3400 BC)*Flint knife with an ivory handle (known as the ''Pit-Rivers Knife''), Sheikh Hamada, Egypt, (c. 3100 BC)*The Battlefield Palette and Hunters Palette, two cosmetic palettes with complex decorative schemes, (c. 3100 BC)*Ivory statuette of a king, from the early temple at Abydos, Egypt, (c. 3000 BC)*King Den's sandal label from Abydos, mid-1st Dynasty, (c. 2985 BC)*Stela of King Peribsen, Abydos, (c. 2720–2710 BC)'''Old Kingdom (2690–2181 BC)'''*Artefacts from the tomb of King Khasekhemwy from the 2nd dynasty, (2690 BC)*Granite statue of Ankhwa, the shipbuilder, Saqqara, Egypt, 3rd Dynasty, (around 2650 BC)*Several of the original casing stones from the Great Pyramid of Giza, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, (c. 2570 BC)*Statue of Nenkheftka from Deshasha, 4th Dynasty, (2500 BC)*Limestone false door of Ptahshepses, (2380 BC)*Wooden tomb statue of Tjeti, Fifth to Sixth Dynasty, (about 2345–2181 BC)'''Middle Kingdom (2134–1690 BC)'''*Inner and outer coffin of Sebekhetepi, Beni Hasan, (about 2125–1795 BC)*Limestone stela of Heqaib, Abydos, Egypt, 12th Dynasty, (1990–1750 BC)*Quartzite statue of Ankhrekhu, 12th Dynasty, (1985–1795 BC)*Granite statue of Senwosret III, (1850 BC)*Block statue and stela of Sahathor,12th Dynasty, reign of Amenemhat II, (about 1922–1878 BC)*Limestone statue and stelae from the offering chapel of Inyotef, Abydos, 12th Dynasty, (about 1920 BC)'''New Kingdom (1549–1069 BC)'''*Schist head of Queen Hatshepsut or her successor Tuthmosis III, (1480 BC)*Fragment of the beard of the Great Sphinx of Giza, (14th century BC)*Colossal head from a statue of Amenhotep III, (1350 BC)*Colossal limestone bust of Amenhotep III, (1350 BC)*Amarna Tablets, 99 out of 382 tablets found, second greatest collection in the world after the Vorderasiatisches Museum, Berlin (203 tablets), (1350 BC)*List of the kings of Egypt from the Temple of Ramesses II, (1250 BC)'''Third Intermediate Period (1069–664 BC)'''*Statue of the Nile god Hapy, Karnak, (c.900 BC)*Mummy case and coffin of Nesperennub, Thebes, (c.800 BC)*Shabaka Stone from Memphis, Egypt 25th Dynasty, (around 700 BC)*Statue of Amun in the form of a ram protecting King Taharqa, (683 BC)*Inner and outer coffins of the priest Hor, Deir el-Bahari, Thebes, 25th Dynasty, (about 680 BC)*Granite statue of the Sphinx of Taharqo, (680 BC)'''Late Period (664–332 BC)'''*Saite Sarcophagus of Satsobek, the vizier (prime minister) of the northern part of Egypt in the reign of Psammetichus I, (664–610 BC)*Bronze figure of Isis and Horus, North Saqqara, Egypt, (600 BC)*Sarcophagus of Hapmen, Cairo, 26th Dynasty or later, (600–300 BC)*Kneeling statue of Wahibre, from near Lake Mariout,  (530 BC)*Sarcophagus of Ankhnesneferibre, (525 BC)*Obelisks and sarcophagus of Pharaoh Nectanebo II, (360–343 BC)'''Ptolemaic dynasty (305–30 BC)'''*The famous Rosetta Stone, trilingual stela that unlocked the ancient Egyptian civilisation, (196 BC)*Giant sculpture of a scarab beetle, (32–30 BC)*Fragment of a basalt Egyptian-style statue of Ptolemy, (305–283 BC)*Mummy of Hornedjitef (inner coffin), Thebes, (3rd century BC)*Wall from a chapel of Queen Shanakdakhete, Meroë, (c. 150 BC)*Naos of Ptolemy VII, Philae, (c. 150 BC)'''Roman Period (30 BC-641 AD)'''*Schist head of a young man, Alexandria, (after 30 BC)*The Meriotic Hamadab Stela from the Kingdom of Kush found near the ancient site of Meroë in Sudan, 24 BC*Lid of the coffin of Soter and Cleopatra from Qurna, Thebes, (early 2nd century AD)*Mummy of a youth with a portrait of the deceased, Hawara, (100–200 AD)*Bronze lamp and patera from the X-group tombs, Qasr Ibrim, (1st–6th centuries AD)*Coptic wall painting of the martyrdom of saints, Wadi Sarga, (6th century AD)File:Bm-ginger.jpg|Room 64 -

These mostly range in date from the beginning of the Greek Bronze Age (about 3200 BC) to the establishment of Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, with the Edict of Milan under the reign of the Roman Emperor Constantine I in 313 AD. Archaeology was in its infancy during the nineteenth century and many pioneering individuals began excavating sites across the Classical world, chief among them for the museum were Charles Newton, John Turtle Wood, Robert Murdoch Smith and Charles Fellows.The Greek objects originate from across the Ancient Greek world, from the mainland of Greece and the Aegean Islands, to neighbouring lands in Asia Minor and Egypt in the eastern Mediterranean and as far as the western lands of Magna Graecia that include Sicily and southern Italy. The Cycladic, Minoan and Mycenaean cultures are represented, and the Greek collection includes important sculpture from the Parthenon in Athens, as well as elements of two of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus and the Temple of Artemis at Ephesos.Beginning from the early Bronze Age, the department also houses one of the widest-ranging collections of Italic and Etruscan antiquities outside Italy, as well as extensive groups of material from Cyprus and non-Greek colonies in Lycia and Caria on Asia Minor. There is some material from the Roman Republic, but the collection's strength is in its comprehensive array of objects from across the Roman Empire, with the exception of Britain (which is the mainstay of the Department of Prehistory and Europe).The collections of ancient jewellery and bronzes, Greek vases (many from graves in southern Italy that were once part of Sir William Hamilton's and Edmé-Antoine Durand|Chevalier Durand's collections), Roman glass including the famous Cameo glass Portland Vase, Roman mosaics from Carthage and Utica in North Africa that were excavated by Nathan Davis, and silver hoards from Roman Gaul (some of which were bequeathed by the philanthropist and museum trustee Richard Payne Knight), are particularly important. Cypriot antiquities are strong too and have benefited from the purchase of Sir Robert Hamilton Lang's collection as well as the bequest of Emma Turner in 1892, which funded many excavations on the island. Roman sculptures (many of which are copies of Greek originals) are particularly well represented by the Townley collection as well as residual sculptures from the famous Farnese collection.Objects from the Department of Greece and Rome are located throughout the museum, although many of the architectural monuments are to be found on the ground floor, with connecting galleries from Gallery 5 to Gallery 23. On the upper floor, there are galleries devoted to smaller material from ancient Italy, Greece, Cyprus and the Roman Empire.Key highlights of the collections include::;Parthenon:*The Parthenon Marbles

The collections represent the civilisations of the ancient Near East and its adjacent areas. These cover Mesopotamia, Persia, the Arabian Peninsula, Anatolia, the Caucasus, parts of Central Asia, Syria, the Holy Land and Phoenician settlements in the western Mediterranean from the prehistoric period and include objects from the beginning of Islam in the 7th century. A collection of immense importance, the holdings of Assyrian, Babylonian and Sumerian antiquities are among the most comprehensive in the world with entire suites of rooms panelled in alabaster bas-reliefs from Assyrian palaces at Nimrud, Nineveh and Khorsabad.  Only the Middle East collections of the Louvre and the Pergamon Museum rival it in the range and quality of artefacts.The first significant addition of Mesopotamian objects was from the collection of Claudius James Rich in 1825. The collection was later dramatically enlarged by the excavations of A. H. Layard at the Assyrian sites of Nimrud and Nineveh between 1845 and 1851. At Nimrud, Layard discovered the North-West Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, as well as three other palaces and various temples. He later uncovered the Palace of Sennacherib at Nineveh with 'no less than seventy-one halls'. As a result, a large numbers of Lamassu's, bas-reliefs, stelae, including the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III, were brought to the British Museum.File:BM; RM6 - ANE, Assyrian Sculpture 14 West Wall (M + N) ~ Assyrian Empire + Lamassu, Gates at Balawat, Relief Panel's ; Full Projection.3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Room 6 – Pair of Human Headed Winged Lions and reliefs from Nimrud with the Balawat Gates, c. 860 BCFile:London 307.JPG|thumbnail|Room 52 – Ancient Iran with the Cyrus Cylinder, considered to be the world's first charter of human rights, 559–530 BCLayard's work was continued by his assistant, Hormuzd Rassam and in 1852–1854 he went on to discover the North Palace of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh with many magnificent reliefs, including the famous Royal Lion Hunt scenes. He also discovered the Royal Library of Ashurbanipal, a large collection of cuneiform tablets of enormous importance that today number around 130,000 pieces. W. K. Loftus excavated in Nimrud between 1850 and 1855 and found a remarkable hoard of ivories in the Burnt Palace. Between 1878 and 1882 Rassam greatly improved the Museum's holdings with exquisite objects including the Cyrus Cylinder from Babylon, the bronze gates from Balawat, important objects from Sippar, and a fine collection of Urartian bronzes from Toprakkale.In the early 20th century excavations were carried out at Carchemish, Turkey by D. G. Hogarth and Leonard Woolley, the latter assisted by T. E. Lawrence. The Mesopotamian collections were greatly augmented by excavations in southern Iraq after the First World War. From Tell al-Ubaid came the bronze furnishings of a Sumerian temple, including life-sized lions and a panel featuring the lion-headed eagle Indugud found by H. R. Hall in 1919–24 . Woolley went onto to excavate Ur between 1922 and 1934, discovering the 'Royal Cemeteries' of the 3rd millennium BC. Some of the masterpieces include the 'Standard of Ur', the 'Ram in a Thicket', the 'Royal Game of Ur', and two bull-headed lyres. The department also has three diorite statues of the ruler Gudea from the ancient state of Lagash and a series of limestone kudurru or boundary stones from different locations across ancient Mesopotamia.Although the collections centre on Mesopotamia, most of the surrounding areas are well represented. The Achaemenid collection was enhanced with the addition of the Oxus Treasure in 1897 and objects excavated by the German scholar Ernst Herzfeld and the Hungarian-British explorer Sir Aurel Stein. Reliefs and sculptures from the site of Persepolis were donated by Sir Gore Ouseley in 1825 and the 5th Earl of Aberdeen in 1861. Moreover, the museum has been able to acquire one of the greatest assemblages of Achaemenid silverware in the world. The later Sasanian Empire is also well represented by ornate silver plates and cups, many representing ruling monarchs hunting lions and deer. Phoenician antiquities come from across the region, but the Tharros collection from Sardinia and the large number of Phoenician stelae from Carthage are outstanding. Another often overlooked highlight is Yemeni antiquities, the finest collection outside that country. Furthermore, the museum has a representative collection of Dilmun and Parthian material excavated from various burial mounds at the ancient sites of A'ali and Shakhura in Bahrain.From the modern state of Syria come almost forty funerary busts from Palmyra and a group of stone reliefs from the excavations of Max von Oppenheim at Tell Halaf that was purchased in 1920. More material followed from the excavations of Max Mallowan at Chagar Bazar and Tell Brak in 1935–1938 and from Woolley at Alalakh in the years just before and after the Second World War. Mallowan returned with his wife Agatha Christie to carry out further digs at Nimrud in the postwar period which secured many important artefacts for the museum. The collection of Palestinian material was strengthened by the work of Kathleen Kenyon at Jericho in the 1950s and the acquisition in 1980 of around 17,000 objects found at Lachish by the Wellcome-Marston expedition of 1932–1938.  Archaeological digs are still taking place where permitted in the Middle East, and, depending on the country, the museum continues to receive a share of the finds from sites such as Tell es Sa'idiyeh in Jordan.The museum's collection of Islamic art, including archaeological material, numbers about 40,000 objects, one of the largest of its kind in the world. As such, it contains a broad range of pottery, paintings, tiles, metalwork, glass, seals, and inscriptions from across the Islamic world, from Spain in the west to India in the east. It is particularly famous for its collection of İznik pottery|Iznik ceramics (the largest in the world), a highlight of which is the mosque lamp from the Dome of the Rock, mediaeval metalwork such as the Vaso Vescovali with its depictions of the Zodiac, a fine selection of astrolabes, and Mughal paintings and precious artwork including a large jade terrapin made for the Emperor Jahangir. Thousands of objects were excavated after the war by professional archaeologists at Iranian sites such as Siraf by David Whitehouse and Alamut Castle by Peter Willey. The collection was augmented in 1983 by the Godman bequest of Iznik, Hispano-Moresque and early Iranian pottery. Artefacts from the Islamic world are on display in Gallery 34 of the museum.A representative selection from the Department of Middle East, including the most important pieces, are on display in 13 galleries throughout the museum and total some 4,500 objects. A whole suite of rooms on the ground floor display the sculptured reliefs from the Assyrian palaces at Nineveh, Nimrud and Khorsabad, while 8 galleries on the upper floor hold smaller material from ancient sites across the Middle East. The remainder form the study collection which ranges in size from beads to large sculptures. They include approximately 130,000 cuneiform tablets from Mesopotamia.Key highlights of the collections include:'''Nimrud:''''''Alabaster bas-reliefs from:'''*The North-West Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, (883–859 BC)*Palace of Adad-nirari III, (811–783 BC)*The Sharrat-Niphi Temple, (c. 9th century BC)*Temple of Ninurta, (c. 9th century BC)*South-East Palace ('Burnt Palace'), (8th–7th century BC)*Central- Palace of Tiglath-Pileser III, (745–727 BC)*South-West Palace of Esarhaddon, (681–669 BC)*The Nabu Temple (Ezida), (c. 7th century BC)'''Sculptures:'''*Pair of Human Headed Lamassu Lions, (883–859 BC)*Human Headed Lamassu Bull, sister piece in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, (883–859 BC)*Human Headed Lamassu Lion, sister piece in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, (883–859 BC)*Colossal Statue of a Lion, (883–859 BC)*Stela and Statue of King Ashurnasirpal II, (883–859 BC)*The Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III, (858–824 BC)*Stela of Shamshi-Adad V, (824–811 BC)*Rare Head of Human Headed 'Lamassu', recovered from the South-West Palace of Esarhaddon, (811–783 BC)*Bilingual Assyrian lion weights with both cuneiform and Phoenician inscriptions, (800–700 BC);'''Nineveh:''''''Alabaster bas-reliefs and sculptures from:'''*South-West Palace of Sennacherib, (705–681 BC)*North-Palace of Ashurbanipal, (c. 645 BC)*The ''Dying Lion'' relief, long acclaimed as a masterpiece, (645 BC)*The famous ''Garden Party'' Relief, (645 BC)*Royal Lion Hunt Scenes, (645–635 BC)*White Obelisk of Ashurnasirpal I, (1050–1031 BC)'''Royal Library of Ashurbanipal:'''*A large collection of cuneiform tablets of enormous importance, approximately 22,000 inscribed clay tablets, (7th century BC)*The Flood Tablet, relating part of the famous ''Epic of Gilgamesh'', (7th century BC)*Taylor Prism, hexagonal clay foundation record, (691 BC);'''Khorsabad and Balawat:'''*Alabaster bas-reliefs from the Palace of Sargon II, (710–705 BC)*Pair of Human Headed Winged Lamassu Bulls, (710–705 BC)*The Balawat Gates of Shalmaneser III, (860 BC);'''Ur:'''*The Standard of Ur with depictions of war and peace, (2600 BC)*Queen's Lyre and gold drinking cup from Queen Puabi's tomb, (2600 BC)*The Ram in a Thicket, one of pair, the other is in Philadelphia, (2600–2400 BC)*The Royal Game of Ur, an ancient game board, (2600–2400 BC);'''Wider Collection:'''*Plastered human skull from Jericho, a very early form of portraiture, Palestine, (7000–6000 BC)*Tell Brak Head, one of the oldest portrait busts from the Middle East, north east Syria, (3500–3300 BC)*Uruk Trough, one of the earliest surviving works of narrative relief sculpture from the Middle East, southern Iraq, (3300–3000 BC)*Statue of Idrimi from the ancient city of Alalakh, southern Turkey, (1600 BC)*A fine collection of Urartian bronzes, which now form the core of the Anatolian collection, eastern Turkey, (9th–6th centuries BC)*Tablet of Shamash, depicting the sun-god Shamash, from Sippar, Iraq, (early 9th century BC)*Two large Assyrian stelae from Kurkh, southern Turkey, (850 BC)*Shebna Inscription from Siloam near Jerusalem, Israel, (7th century BC)*East India House Inscription from Babylon, Iraq, (604–562 BC)*Lachish Letters, group of ostraka written in alphabetic Hebrew from Lachish, Israel, (586 BC)*Cylinder of Nabonidus, foundation cylinder of King Nabonidus, Sippar, Iraq, (555–540 BC)*The famous Oxus Treasure, the largest ancient Persian hoard of gold artefacts, (550–330 BC)*The Punic-Libyan Inscription from the Mausoleum of Ateban, Dougga, Tunisia, (146 BC)*Amran Tablets found near Sana'a, Yemen, (1st century BC)*Two limestone ossuaries from caves in Jerusalem, (1st century AD)File:Raminathicket2.jpg|Room 56 – The 'Ram in a Thicket' figure, one of a pair, from Ur, Southern Iraq, c. 2600 BCFile:Standard of Ur -

It ranks as one of the largest and best print room collections in existence alongside the Albertina in Vienna, the Paris collections and the Hermitage. The holdings are easily accessible to the general public in the Study Room, unlike many such collections. The department also has its own exhibition gallery in Room 90, where the displays and exhibitions change several times a year.Since its foundation in 1808, the prints and drawings collection has grown to international renown as one of the richest and most representative collections in the world. There are approximately 50,000 drawings and over two million prints.bmgalThe collection of drawings covers the period from the 14th century to the present, and includes many works of the highest quality by the leading artists of the European schools. The collection of prints covers the tradition of fine printmaking from its beginnings in the 15th century up to the present, with near complete holdings of most of the great names before the 19th century. Key benefactors to the department have been Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode, Richard Payne Knight, John Malcolm, Campbell Dodgson, César Mange de Hauke and Tomás Harris.There are groups of drawings by Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo, (including his only surviving full-scale cartoon), Albrecht Dürer|Dürer (a collection of 138 drawings is one of the finest in existence), Peter Paul Rubens, Rembrandt, Claude and Watteau, and largely complete collections of the works of all the great printmakers including Albrecht Dürer|Dürer (99 engravings, 6 etchings and most of his 346 woodcuts), Rembrandt and Goya. More than 30,000 British drawings and watercolours include important examples of work by Hogarth, Sandby, Turner, Girtin, Constable, Cotman, Cox, Gillray, Rowlandson and Cruikshank, as well as all the great Victorians. There are about a million British prints including more than 20,000 satires and outstanding collections of works by William Blake and Thomas Bewick.. The great eleven volume Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum compiled between 1870 and 1954 is the definitive reference work for the study of British Satirical prints. Over 500,000 objects from the department are now on the online collection database, many with high quality images. A 2011 donation of £1 million enabled the museum to acquire a complete set of Pablo Picasso's ''Vollard Suite''.File:Rogier van der Weyden - Portrait of a Young Woman - WGA25729.jpg|Rogier van der Weyden - Portrait of a Young Woman, c. 1440File:A fool, seated on a basket, about to be shaved by a nun holding a wafer iron by Hieronymus Bosch.jpg|Hieronymus Bosch - A comical barber scene, c. 1477-1516File:Botticelli, allegoria dell'abbondanza, disegno.jpg|Sandro Botticelli - Allegory of Abundance, 1480-1485File:Leonardo da vinci, Study for the Burlington House Cartoon.jpg|Leonardo da Vinci – The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and the Infant Saint John the Baptist (prep for 'The Burlington House Cartoon'), c. 1499–1500File:Adam study - Michelangelo.jpg|Michelangelo – Studies of a reclining male nude: Adam in the fresco 'The Creation of Man' on the vault of the Sistine Chapel, c. 1511File:Raffaello, studio di testa di madonna e bambino.jpg|Raphael – Study of Heads, Mother and Child, c. 1509-11File:Titian - Drowning of the Pharaoh's Host in the Red Sea - WGA22989.jpg|Titian – Drowning of the Pharaoh's Host in the Red Sea, 1515–17File:Albrecht Dürer - Walrus - WGA07101.jpg|Albrecht Dürer - Drawing of a walrus, 1521File:A Lady, called Anne Boleyn, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|Hans Holbein the Younger - Portrait of Anne Boleyn, 1536File:Peter Paul Rubens 077.jpg|Peter Paul Rubens - Drawing of a lioness, c. 1614-1615File:Head of a monk, 1625-64, Francisco de Zurbarán.

It includes some of the earliest objects made by humans in east Africa over 2 million years ago, as well as Prehistoric and neolithic objects from other parts of the world; and the art and archaeology of Europe from the earliest times to the present day. Archeological excavation of prehistoric material took off and expanded considerably in the twentieth century and the department now has literally millions of objects from the Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods throughout the world, as well as from the Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron age in Europe. Stone Age material from Africa has been donated by famous archaeologists such as Louis and Mary Leakey, and Gertrude Caton–Thompson. Paleolithic objects from the Sturge, Christy and Édouard Lartet|Lartet collections include some of the earliest works of art from Europe. Many Bronze Age objects from across Europe were added during the nineteenth century, often from large collections built up by excavators and scholars such as Greenwell in Britain, Tobin and Cooke in Ireland, Lukis and de la Grancière in Brittany, Worsaae in Denmark, Siret at El Argar in Spain, and Klemm and Edelmann in Germany. A representative selection of Iron Age artefacts from Hallstatt were acquired as a result of the Evans/Lubbock excavations and from Giubiasco in Ticino through the Swiss National Museum.In addition, the British Museum's collections covering the period AD 300 to 1100 are among the largest and most comprehensive in the world, extending from Spain to the Black Sea and from North Africa to Scandinavia; a representative selection of these has recently been redisplayed in a newly refurbished gallery. Important collections include Latvian, Norwegian, Gotlandic and Merovingian material from Johann Karl Bähr, Alfred Heneage Cocks, Sir James Curle and Philippe Delamain respectively. However, the undoubted highlight from the early mediaeval period are the magnificent items from the Sutton Hoo royal grave, generously donated to the nation by the landowner Edith Pretty. The department includes the national collection of horology with one of the most wide ranging assemblage of clocks, watches and other timepieces in Europe, with masterpieces from every period in the development of time-keeping. Choice horological pieces came from the Morgan and Ilbert collections. The department is also responsible for the curation of Romano-British objects – the museum has by far the most extensive such collection in Britain and one of the most representative regional collections in Europe outside Italy. It is particularly famous for the large number of late Roman silver treasures, many of which were found in East Anglia, the most important of which is the Mildenhall Treasure. The museum purchased many Roman-British objects from the antiquarian Charles Roach Smith in 1856.  These quickly formed the nucleus of the collection.Objects from the Department of Prehistory and Europe are mostly found on the upper floor of the museum, with a suite of galleries numbered from 38 to 51. Most of the collection is stored in its archive facilities, where it is available for research and study.Key highlights of the collections include:'''Stone Age (c. 3.4 million years BC – c. 2000

Until recently, this department concentrated on collecting Oriental antiquities from urban or semi-urban societies across the Asian continent. Many of those objects were collected by colonial officers and explorers in former parts of the British Empire, especially the Indian subcontinent. Examples include the collections made by individuals such as Charles Stuart, James Prinsep, Charles Masson, Sir Alexander Cunningham, Sir Harold Deane and Sir John Marshall. A large number of Chinese antiquities were purchased from the Anglo-Greek banker George Eumorfopoulos in the 1930s. In the second half of the twentieth century, the museum greatly benefited from the bequest of the philanthropist PT Brooke Sewell, which allowed the department to purchase many objects and fill in gaps in the collection.In 2004, the ethnographic collections from Asia were transferred to the department. These reflect the diverse environment of the largest continent in the world and range from India to China, the Middle East to Japan. Much of the ethnographic material comes from objects originally owned by tribal cultures and hunter-gatherers, many of whose way of life has disappeared in the last century. Particularly valuable collections are from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (much assembled by the British naval officer Maurice Portman), Sri Lanka, Northern Thailand, south-west China, the Ainu of Hokaidu in Japan (chief among them the collection of the Scottish zoologist John Anderson), Siberia and the islands of South-East Asia, especially Borneo. The latter benefited from the purchase in 1905 of the Sarawak collection put together by Dr Charles Hose, as well as from other colonial officers such as Edward A Jeffreys. In addition, a unique and valuable group of objects from Java, including shadow puppets and a gamelan musical set, was assembled by Sir Stamford Raffles.The principal gallery devoted to Asian art in the museum is Gallery 33 with its comprehensive display of Chinese, Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asian objects. An adjacent gallery showcases the Amaravati sculptures and monuments. Other galleries on the upper floors are devoted to its Japanese, Korean, painting and calligraphy, and Chinese ceramics collections.Key highlights of the collections include:*The most comprehensive collection of sculpture from the Indian subcontinent in the world, including the celebrated Buddhist limestone reliefs from Amaravati excavated by Sir Walter Elliot*An outstanding collection of Chinese antiquities, paintings, and porcelain, lacquer, bronze, jade, and other applied arts*The most comprehensive collection of Japanese pre-20th century art in the Western world, many of which originally belonged to the surgeon William Anderson and diplomat Ernest Mason Satow'''East Asia'''*A large collection of Chinese ritual bronzes, (from c. 1500 BC onwards)*Huixian Bronze Hu, an identical pair of bronze vessels from the Eastern Zhou Period, China, (5th century BC)*Japanese antiquities from the Kofun period excavated by the pioneering archaeologist William Gowland, (3rd–6th centuries AD)*The famous Admonitions Scroll by Chinese artist Gu Kaizhi, (344–406 AD)*The colossal Amitābha Buddha from Hancui, China, (585 AD)*A set of ceramic Tang dynasty tomb figures of Liu Tingxun, (c.728 AD)*Seated Luohan from Yixian, one from a set of eight surviving statues, China, (907–1125 AD)*A fine assemblage of Buddhist paintings from Dunhuang, western China, collected by the British-Hungarian explorer Aurel Stein, (5th–11th centuries AD)*Pericival David collection of Chinese ceramics, (10th–18th centuries AD)*Ivory stand in the form of a seated lion, Chos-'khor-yan-rtse monastery in Tibet, (13th century AD)*Pair of ceramic Kakiemon elephants from Japan, (17th century AD)*Japanese prints including The Great Wave off Kanagawa, (1829–32)'''South Asia'''*Excavated objects from the Indus Valley sites of Mohenjo-daro, and Harappa, Pakistan, (2500–2000 BC)*Sandstone fragment of a Pillar of Ashoka with Brahmi inscription from Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, India, (238 BC)*The Kulu Vase found near a monastery in Himachel Pradesh, one of the earliest examples of figurative art from the sub-continent, northern India, (1st century BC)*Copper plate from Taxila, with important Kharoshthi inscription, Pakistan, (1st century BC – 1st century AD)*Indo-Scythian sandstone Mathura Lion Capital and Bracket figure from one of the gateways to the Great Stupa at Sanchi, central India, (1st century AD)*Bimaran Casket and Wardak Vase, reliquaries from ancient stupas in Afghanistan, (1st–2nd centuries AD)*Relic deposits from the stupas at Manikyala, Ahin Posh, Sanchi and Gudivada, (1st–3rd centuries AD)*Seated Buddha from Gandhara, and other Gandhara objects from Kafir Kot, Jamal Garhi and Takht-i-Bahi, Pakistan, (1st–3rd centuries AD)*The Buddhapad Hoard of bronze images from southern India, (6th–8th centuries AD)*Stone statue of Buddha from the Sultanganj hoard, Bihar, eastern India.

Over 350,000 objects spanning thousands of years tells the history of mankind from three major continents and many rich and diverse cultures; the collecting of modern artefacts is ongoing. Many individuals have added to the department's collection over the years but those assembled by Henry Christy, Harry Beasley and William Oldman are outstanding. Objects from this department are mostly on display in several galleries on the ground and lower floors. Gallery 24 displays ethnographic from every continent while adjacent galleries focus on North America and Mexico. A long suite of rooms (Gallery 25) on the lower floor display African art. There are plans in place to develop permanent galleries for showcasing art from Oceania and South America.'''Africa'''File:Room 25 British Museum.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Room 25 – African pots on display in the galleryThe Sainsbury African Galleries display 600 objects from the greatest permanent collection of African arts and culture in the world. The three permanent galleries provide a substantial exhibition space for the Museum's African collection comprising over 200,000 objects. A curatorial scope that encompasses both archaeological and contemporary material, including both unique masterpieces of artistry and objects of everyday life. A great addition was material amassed by Sir Henry Wellcome, which was donated by the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum in 1954. Highlights of the African collection include objects found at megalithic circles in The Gambia, a dozen exquisite Afro-Portuguese ivories, a series of soapstone figures from the Kissi people in Sierra Leone and Liberia, Asante goldwork and regalia from Ghana including the Bowdich collection, the rare Akan Drum from the same region in west Africa, the Benin and Igbo-Ukwu bronze sculptures, the beautiful Bronze Head of Queen Idia, a magnificent brass head of a Yoruba ruler and quartz throne from Ife, a similar terracotta head from Iwinrin Grove near Ife, the Apapa Hoard from Lagos, southern Nigeria, an Ikom monolith from Cross River State, the Torday collection of central African sculpture, textiles and weaponry from the Kuba Kingdom including three royal figures, the unique Luzira Head from Uganda, processional crosses and other ecclesiastical and royal material from Gondar and Magdala, Ethiopia following the British Expedition to Abyssinia, excavated objects from Great Zimbabwe (that includes a unique soapstone, anthropomorphic figure) and satellite towns such as Mutare including a large hoard of Iron Age soapstone figures, a rare divining bowl from the Venda peoples and cave paintings and petroglyphs from South Africa.'''Oceania'''The British Museum's Oceanic collections originate from the vast area of the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Papua New Guinea to Easter Island, from New Zealand to Hawaii. The three main anthropological groups represented in the collection are Polynesia, Melanesia and Micronesia – Aboriginal art from Australia is considered separately in its own right.  Metal working was not indigenous to Oceania before Europeans arrived, so many of the artefacts from the collection are made from stone, shell, bone and bamboo. Prehistoric objects from the region include a bird-shaped pestle and a group of stone mortars from Papua New Guinea. The British Museum is fortunate in having some of the earliest Oceanic and Pacific collections, many of which were put together by members of Cook's and Vancouver's expeditions or by colonial administrators such as Sir George Grey, Sir Frederick Broome and Arthur Gordon, before Western culture significantly impacted on indigenous cultures. The Wilson cabinet of curiosities from Palau is another example of pre-contact ware. The department has also benefited greatly from the legacy of pioneering anthropologists such as Bronisław Malinowski and Katherine Routledge. In addition, the Māori culture|Māori collection is the finest outside New Zealand with many intricately carved wooden and jade objects and the Aboriginal art collection is distinguished by its wide range of bark paintings, including two very early bark etchings collected by John Hunter Kerr. A poignant artefact is the wooden shield found near Botany Bay during Cook's first voyage in 1770. A particularly important group of objects was purchased from the London Missionary Society in 1911, that includes the unique statue of A'a from Rurutu Island, the rare idol from the isle of Mangareva and the Cook Islands deity figure.  Other highlights include the huge Hawaiian statue of Kū|Kū-ka-ili-moku or god of war (one of three extant in the world) and the famous Easter Island statues Hoa Hakananai'a and Moai Hava.'''Americas'''File:Mexico Gallery British Museum (2).jpg|thumb|Room 27 – Huaxtec art on display in the Mexico GalleryThe Americas collection mainly consists of 19th and 20th century items although the Paracas, Moche, Inca, Maya, Aztec, Taino and other early cultures are well represented. The Kayung totem pole, which was made in the late nineteenth century in the Queen Charlotte Islands, dominates the Great Court and provides a fitting introduction to this very wide ranging collection that stretches from the very north of the North American continent where the Inuit population has lived for centuries, to the tip of South America where indigenous tribes have long thrived in Patagonia. Highlights of the collection include First Nation objects from Alaska and Canada collected by the 5th Earl of Lonsdale and the Marquis of Lorne, the Squier and Davis collection of prehistoric mound relics from North America, a selection of pottery vessels found in cliff-dwellings at Mesa Verde, a collection of turquoise Aztec mosaics from Mexico (the largest in Europe), important artefacts from Teotihuacan and Isla de Sacrificios, several rare pre-Columbian manuscripts including the Codex Zouche-Nuttall and Codex Waecker-Gotter, a spectacular series of Mayan lintels from Yaxchilan excavated by the British Mayanist Alfred Maudslay, a very high quality Mayan collection that includes sculptures from Copán Bench Panel|Copan, Tikal, Tulum, Pusilha, Naranjo and Nebaj (including the celebrated Fenton Vase), a group of Zemi Figures from Vere, Jamaica, a number of prestigious pre-Columbian gold and votive objects from Colombia, ethnographic objects from across the Amazon region including the Schomburgk collection, two rare Tiwanaku pottery vessels from Lake Titicaca and important items from Tierra del Fuego donated by Commander Phillip Parker King.File:British Museum otter pipe.jpg|Room 26 - Stone pipe representing an otter from Mound City, Ohio, USA, 200 BC - 400 ADFile:British Museum tomb guardian.jpg|Room 2 - Stone tomb guardian, part human part jaguar, from San Agustín, Colombia, c. 300-600 ADFile:Maya maize god statue.jpg|Room 1 - Maya maize god statue from Copán, Honduras, 600-800 ADFile:Gold Lime Flasks (poporos) Quimbaya Culture, Colombia AD 600-1100 - British Museum.jpg|Room 24 - Gold Lime Flasks (poporos), Quimbaya Culture, Colombia, 600-1100 ADFile:Maya, lintel 25, da yaxchilan, 725.JPG|Room 27 - Lintel 25 from Yaxchilan, Late Classic, Mexico, 600-900 ADFile:Bird pectoral, Popayan, gold alloy, AD900–1600..jpg|Room 24 - Bird pectoral made from gold alloy, Popayán, Colombia, 900-1600 ADFile:Hoa Hakananai'a - Moai in the British Museum.jpeg|Room 24 – Easter Island statue Hoa Hakananai'a Wellcome Trust Gallery, 1000 ADFile:Double-headed serpent turquoise mosaic.jpg|Room 27 - Double-headed serpent turquoise mosaic, Aztec, Mexico, 1400-1500 ADFile:Turquoise Mosaic Mask (Mixtec-Aztec, AD 1400-1521) - British Museum.jpg|Room 27 - Turquoise Mosaic Mask, Mixtec-Aztec, Mexico, 1400-1500 ADFile:Miniature gold llama figurine.jpg|Room 2 - Miniature gold llama figurine, Inca, Peru, about 1500 ADFile:Benin Bronzes at the British Museum 1.jpg|Room 25 - Part of the famous collection of Benin brass plaques, Nigeria, 1500-1600 ADFile:Benin brass plaque 01.jpg|Room 25 - Detail of one of the Benin brass plaques in the museum, Nigeria, 1500-1600 ADFile:Idia mask BM Af1910 5-13 1.jpg|Room 25 - Ivory mask of Queen Idia, Nigeria, 16th century ADFile:Hawaiian feather helmet, British Museum 3.jpg|Room 24 - Hawaiian feather helmet or mahiole, late 1700s ADFile:British museum, totem.JPG|Great Court - Two house frontal totem poles, Haida, British Columbia, Canada, about 1850 ADFile:Punu mask BM Af1904 11-22 1.jpg|Room 25 - Mask (wood and pigment); Punu people, Gabon, 19th century ADFile:Otobo masquerade.jpg|Room 25 - Otobo masquerade in the Africa Gallery, Nigeria, 20th century ADFile:El Anatsui - Man's Cloth.jpg|Room 25 - Modern interpretation of kente cloth from Ghana, late 20th century ADDepartment of Coins and MedalsFile:Room 68 British Museum.jpg|thumb|Room 68 – The refurbished Money Gallery at the museumThe British Museum is home to one of the world's finest numismatic collections, comprising about a million objects, including coins, medals, tokens and paper money. The collection spans the entire history of coinage from its origins in the 7th century BC to the present day and is representative of both the East and West. As in other parts of the museum, the department has been able to expand its collection by purchase, donation and bequest. The department has benefited from the munificence of collectors such as Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode, Sarah Banks, Edward Hawkins, Sir Alexander Cunningham and George Bleazby. A significant strength of the collection are British coins from all ages, which have benefited from the ancient law of Treasure Trove.  This has enabled the museum to purchase important hoards of gold and silver coins, many of which were buried during periods of crisis or upheaval. There are approximately 9,000 coins, medals and banknotes on display around the British Museum. More than half of these can be found in the Citi Money Gallery (Gallery 68), while the remainder form part of the permanent displays throughout the museum. Items from the full collection can be seen by the general public in the Study Room by appointment.File:British Museum gold coin of Croesus.jpg|Gold coin of Croesus, Lydian, modern Turkey, c. 550 BCFile:Chinese knife money.jpg|Knife money made from bronze, China, 4th-3rd centuries BCFile:Alexander coin, British Museum.jpg| Tetradrachm of Lysimachos with the head of Alexander, Greece, about 305-281BCFile:Tetradrachm Ptolemy V.jpg|Tetradrachm issued by Ptolemy V, Greece, 204–181 BCFile:British Museum Alton A Hoard.jpg|50 gold staters of Commius, Tincomarus and Eppillus, Alton, southern England, 1st century BC - 1st century ADFile:Roman gold coins excavated in Pudukottai India one coin of Caligula 31 41 and two coins of Nero 54 68.jpg|Roman coins of Nero and Caligula found at Pudukottai, India, 1st century ADFile:TrajanCoinAhinposhBuddhistMonasteryAfghanistan.jpg|Coin of Trajan from Ahin Posh Buddhist monastery in Afghanistan, 2nd century ADFile:Battriana, monete d'oro del IV secolo 03.JPG|Gold coin from Bactria, Afghanistan, 4th century ADFile:Honorius Hoxne 1.jpg|Gold coin of Emperor Honorius from Hoxne Hoard, England, 4th-5th centuries ADFile:Gold coin of Kumaragupta I.jpg|Gold coin of Kumaragupta I,  Gupta Empire, India, 415–455 ADFile:Wigmund archibishop of York 837 854 gold solidus.jpg|Gold solidus of Wigmund, Archibishop of York, northern England,  837-854 ADFile:Nasr II Nishapur coin 921 922.jpg|Nasr II, Nishapur coin, central Asia, 921-922 ADFile:Aethelred II gold mancus 1003 1006.jpg|Aethelred II gold mancu, England, 1003-1006 ADFile:British Museum Ming banknote.jpg|Chinese Ming banknote for 1 guan, China, 1375 ADFile:British Museum Fishpool Hoard.jpg|Fishpool Hoard of mediaeval coins, northern England, late 15th century ADFile:Quentin metsys, medaglia di desiderio erasmo.JPG|Renaissance medal of Desiderius Erasmus, by Quentin Massijs, Holland, 16th century ADFile:British Museum Sharja Hoard.jpg|Hoard comprising 78 Persian silver coins from Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, late 17th century ADFile:8 Reales, 1770, British Museum 1.jpg| 8 Reales silver coin minted in Potosí, Bolivia, 1770 ADDepartment of Conservation and Scientific ResearchThis department was founded in 1920. Conservation has six specialist areas: ceramics ; glass; metals; organic material (including textiles); stone, wall paintings and mosaics; Eastern pictorial art and Western pictorial art. The science department has and continues to develop techniques to date artefacts, analyse and identify the materials used in their manufacture, to identify the place an artefact originated and the techniques used in their creation. The department also publishes its findings and discoveries.Libraries and ArchivesThis department covers all levels of education, from casual visitors, schools, degree level and beyond. The Museum's various libraries hold in excess of 350,000 books, journals and pamphlets covering all areas of the museum's collection. Also the general Museum archives which date from its foundation in 1753 are overseen by this department; the individual departments have their own separate archives and libraries covering their various areas of responsibility, which can be consulted by the public on application.  The Anthropology Library is especially large, with 120,000 volumes.See the "Facilities and Services" tab on the home page for each department for details on each library; not all are kept at Bloomsbury.  However, the Paul Hamlyn Library, which had become the central reference library of the British Museum and the only library there freely open to the general public, closed permanently in August 2011. The website and online database of the collection also provide increasing amounts of information.British Museum PressThe British Museum Press (BMP) is the publishing business and a division of the British Museum Company Ltd, a company and a charity (established in 1973) wholly owned by the Trustees of the British Museum.The BMP publishes both popular and scholarly illustrated books to accompany the exhibition programme and explore aspects of the general collection. Profits from their sales goes to support the British Museum."aboutbmp"Scholarly titles are published in the Research Publications series, all of which are peer-reviewed. This series was started in 1978 and was originally called Occasional Papers. The series is designed to disseminate research on items in the collection. Between six and eight titles are published each year in this series.ControversyFile:Elgin Marbles east pediment.jpg|thumb|right|A few of the Elgin Marbles (also known as the Parthenon Marbles) from the East Pediment of the Parthenon.It is a point of controversy whether museums should be allowed to possess artefacts taken from other countries, and the British Museum is a notable target for criticism. The Elgin Marbles, Benin Bronzes and the Rosetta Stone are among the most disputed objects in its collections, and organisations have been formed demanding the return of these artefacts to their native countries of Greece, Nigeria and Egypt respectively.  Parthenon Marbles claimed by Greece were also claimed by UNESCO among others for restitution. From 1801 to 1812, Elgin's agents took about half of the surviving sculptures of the Parthenon, as well as sculptures from the Propylaea and Erechtheum.In recent years, controversies pertaining to reparation of looted artefacts taken from the Old Summer Palace during the Anglo-French invasion in 1860 have also begun to surface. The ransacking and destruction of the Chinese palaces has lead to deep unhealed historical wounds in Chinese cultural history. Victor Hugo, one of the most celebrated French novelist and poet, already condemned both the French and British for their plundering. The British Museum and Victoria ; Albert Museum, among other nations, have been asked since 2009 to open their archives for investigation by a team of Chinese Investigators as a part of an international mission to document lost national treasures. However, there have been fears that the United Kingdom may be asked to return these treasures. As of 2010, Neil MacGregor, the Director of the British Museum, said he hoped that both British and Chinese investigators would work together on the controversial collection, which continue to result in resentment in China.The British Museum has refused to return these artefacts, stating that the "restitutionist premise, that whatever was made in a country must return to an original geographical site, would empty both the British Museum and the other great museums of the world". The Museum has also argued that the British Museum Act of 1963 legally prevents any object from leaving its collection once it has entered it. Nevertheless, it has returned items such as the Tasmanian Ashes after a 20-year-long battle with Australia.The British Museum continues to assert that it is an appropriate custodian and has an inalienable right to its disputed artefacts under British law.Disputed items in the collection*Elgin Marbles – claimed by Greece and backed by UNESCO among others for restitution*Benin Bronzes – claimed by Nigeria, 30 pieces sold by the British Museum privately to the Nigerian government in the 1950s* Ethiopian Tabots – claimed by Ethiopia* 4 stolen drawings (Nazi plunder) – Compensation paid to Uri Peled for the amount of £175,000 by the British Museum* Achaemenid empire gold and silver artefacts from the Oxus Treasure – claimed by Tajikistan* Aboriginal human remains – returned to Tasmania by the British Museum "ktixsj"* Rosetta Stone – claimed by Egypt* Some 24,000+ scrolls, manuscripts, paintings, scriptures, and relics from the Mogao Caves, including the Diamond Sutra – claimed by the People's Republic of China* Anahit goddess statue – claimed by ArmeniaGalleries;''Building''File:BM, Main Floor Main Entrance Hall ~ South Stairs.6.JPG|Main Staircase, Discobolus of Myron (the Discus-Thrower)File:British Museum Reading Room Panorama Feb 2006.jpg|British Museum Reading RoomFile:British Museum 2010-06-04 B.jpg|Ceiling of the Great Court and the black siltstone obelisks of Nectanebo II, c. 350 BCFile:Flickr - Nic's events - British Museum with Cory and Mary, 6 Sep 2007 - 183.jpg|Detail of an Ionic capital on a pilaster in the Great CourtFile:England; London - The British Museum, Facade South Front ~ -Main Entrance + West Wing- Colonnade + The Africa Garden.2.jpg|African Garden – created by BBC TV programme Ground Force;''Museum Galleries''''Department of Ancient Egypt and Sudan''File:BM, AES Egyptian Sculpture (Room 4), View South + Towards Assyrian Sculpture Gallery (Room 6).JPG|Room 4 – Egyptian Sculpture, view towards the Assyrian TranseptFile:BM, AES Egyptian Sculpture (Room 4), View North.3.JPG|Room 4File:Egyptian Gallery.JPG|Room 4''Department of the Middle East''File:BM; RM6 - ANE, Assyrian Sculpture 32 -East (N), Centre Island + North Wall- ~ Assyrian Empire + -Lamassu, Stela's, Statue's, Obelisk's, Relief Panel's ; Full Projection.1.jpg|The British Museum, Room 6 – Assyrian SculptureFile:BM; RM8 - ANE, Nimrud Palace Reliefs 75 South + East Wall (S) ~ Central Palace of Tiglath-pileser III (744-727 B.C) + Full Elevation ; Viewing South.1.JPG| Room 8 – Pair of Lamassu from Nimrud ; reliefs from the palace of Tiglath-Pileser IIIFile:BM; RM7 - ANE, Nimrud Palace Reliefs 1 Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 B.C) ~ Full Elevation ; Viewing South.JPG| Room 7 – Reliefs from the North-west palace of Ashurnasirpal II, NimrudFile:BM; ANE - RM 89, Assyrian Reliefs ~ Nineveh.JPG| Room 89 – Nimrud ; Nineveh Palace ReliefsFile:BM; ANE - Nineveh, The Royal Lion Hunt (Room 10).JPG| Room 10 – Nineveh, The Royal Lion Hunt''Department of Greece and Rome''File:Parthenon Frieze.JPG|Room 18 – Ancient GreeceFile:Tomb of Merehi 1.jpg|Room 20a – Tomb of Merehi ; Greek Vases, Lycia, 360 BCFile:British Museum - Room 85, Roman Portrait Sculpture.JPG|Room 85 – Portrait Sculpture, RomanFile:BM; GMR - RM 83, Roman Sculpture.JPG|Room 83 – Roman SculptureFile:Townley Sculptures.JPG| Room 84 – Towneley Roman SculpturesFile:SFEC BritMus Roman 022.JPG|Main Staircase – Discobolus, RomanFile:The Townley Caryatid (anterior).jpg|Main Staircase – Townley Caryatid, Roman, 140–160 AD;''Exhibitions''''Forgotten Empire Exhibition (October 2005 – January 2006)''File:Forgotten Empire Exhibition, (Room 5).1.JPG | Room 5 – Exhibitions PanoramaFile:The British Museum, Room 5-Persepolis Bas-relief.jpg| Room 5 – The Persepolis CastsFile:BM; ANE - Forgotten Empire Exhibition, (Room 5).3.JPG | Room 5 – Exhibitions RelicsFile:BM; ANE - Forgotten Empire Exhibition, The Cyrus Cylinder (Room 5).JPG| Room 5 – The Cyrus CylinderSee also*''A History of the World in 100 Objects''*Employees of the British Museum*List of most visited art museums in the world*People associated with the British Museum*The British Museum FriendsNotes'''a.''' none Sculptures and applied art are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum houses earlier art, non-Western art, prints and drawings, and art of a later date is at Tate Modern. The National Gallery, holds the National Collection of Western European Art, with Tate Britain deposited with British Art from 1500.'''b.''' none By the Act of Parliament it received a name – the British Museum. The origin of the name is not known; the word 'British' had some resonance nationally at this period, so soon after the Jacobite rebellion of 1745; it must be assumed that the Museum was christened in this light.'''c.''' none The estimated footage of the various libraries as reported to the Trustees has been summarised by Harris (1998), 3,6: Sloane 4,600, Harley 1,700, Cotton 384, Edwards 576, The Royal Library 1,890.'''d.''' none This was perhaps rather unfortunate as the title to the house was complicated by the fact that part of the building had been erected on leasehold property (the Crown lease of which ran out in 1771); perhaps that is why George III paid such a modest price (nominally £28,000) for what was to become Buckingham Palace. See Howard Colvin''et al.'' (1976), 134.'''e.''' none Understanding of the foundation of the National Gallery is complicated by the fact that there is no documented history of the institution. At first the National Gallery functioned effectively as part of the British Museum, to which the Trustees transferred most of their most important pictures (ex. portraits). Full control was handed over to the National Gallery in 1868, after the List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 1840–1859|Act of Parliament of 1856 established the Gallery as an independent body.'''f.''' none Ashmole, the Keeper of the Greek and Roman Antiquities appreciated the original top-lighting of these galleries and removed the Victorian colour scheme, commenting:The old Elgin Gallery was painted a deep terracotta red, which, though in some ways satisfactory, diminished its apparent size, and was apt to produce a depressing effect on the visitor. It was decided to experiment with lighter colours, and the walls of the large room were painted with what was, at its first application, a pure cold white, but which after a year's exposure had unfortunately yellowed. The small Elgin Room was painted with pure white tinted with prussian blue, and the Room of the metopes was painted with pure white tinted with cobalt blue and black; it was necessary, for practical reasons, to colour all the dadoes a darker colour;/blockquote;'''g.''' none Ashmole had never liked the Duveen Gallery:It is, I suppose, not positively bad, but it could have been infinitely better. It is pretentious, in that it uses the ancient Marbles to decorate itself. This is a long outmoded idea, and the exact opposite of what a sculpture gallery should do. And, although it incorporates them, it is out of scale, and tends to dwarf them with its bogus Doric features, including those columns, supporting almost nothing which would have made an ancient Greek artist architect wince.
