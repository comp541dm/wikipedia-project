Blue Angels (song)The '''Blue Angels''' is the United States Navy's flight demonstration squadron, with aviators from the Navy and Marines. The Blue Angels team was formed in 1946,. Blue Angels official site. making it the second oldest formal flying aerobatic team (under the same name) in the world, after the French Patrouille de France formed in 1931. The Blue Angels' six demonstration pilots fly the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18 Hornet, typically in more than 70 shows at 34 locations throughout the United States each year, where they still employ many of the same practices and techniques used in their aerial displays in 1946. An estimated 11 million spectators view the squadron during air shows each full year. The Blue Angels also visit more than 50,000 people in a standard show season (March through November) in schools and hospitals. Since 1946, the Blue Angels have flown for more than 260 million spectators.On 1 March 2013 the U.S. Navy announced that due to sequestration actions aerial demonstration team performances including that of the Blue Angels would cease from 1 April 2013. 1 March 2013 NBC News; [U.S. Navy Cancels Blue Angels 2013 Performances] 10 April 2013, U.S. Navy In October 2013, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, stating that "community and public outreach is a crucial Departmental activity", announced that the Blue Angels (along with the U.S. Air Force's Thunderbirds) would resume appearing at air shows starting in 2014, although the number of flyovers will continue to be severely reduced.MissionsThe mission of the United States Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron is "to showcase the pride and professionalism of the United States Navy and Marine Corps by inspiring a culture of excellence and service to country through flight demonstrations and community outreach.""Blueangels.navy.mil"Air showThe Blue Angels' show season runs each year from March until November. They perform at both military and civilian airfields, and often perform directly over major cities such as San Francisco's "Fleet Week" maritime festival, Cleveland's annual Labor Day Air Show, the Chicago Air and Water Show, Milwaukee Air and Water Show, and Seattle's annual Seafair festival.File:Blue Angels Flying in Delta Formation at Miramar.jpg|thumb|left|The Blue Angels flying in a Delta Formation at Miramar, San Diego in 2011During their aerobatic demonstration, the Blues fly six F/A-18 Hornet aircraft, split into the Diamond Formation (Blue Angels 1 through 4) and the Lead and Opposing ''Solos'' (Blue Angels 5 and 6). Most of the show alternates between maneuvers performed by the Diamond Formation and those performed by the Solos. The Diamond, in tight formation and usually at lower speeds (400mph), performs maneuvers such as formation loops, barrel rolls, and transitions from one formation to another. The Solos showcase the high performance capabilities of their individual aircraft through the execution of high-speed passes, slow passes, fast rolls, slow rolls, and very tight turns. The highest speed flown during an air show is 700mph (just under Mach 1) and the lowest speed is 120mph."Blueangels.navy.mil"Some of the maneuvers include both solo aircraft performing at once, such as opposing passes (toward each other in what appears to be a collision course) and mirror formations (back-to-back. belly-to-belly, or wingtip-to-wingtip, with one jet flying inverted). The Solos join the Diamond Formation near the end of the show for a number of maneuvers in the Delta Formation.The parameters of each show must be tailored in accordance with local weather conditions at showtime: in clear weather the ''high'' show is performed; in overcast conditions a ''low'' show is performed, and in limited visibility (weather permitting) the ''flat'' show is presented.The ''high'' show requires at least an  ceiling and visibility of at least 0 from the show's centerpoint. The maximum ceilings allowed for low and flat shows are 3,500 feet (~1km) and -1, respectively.Origin of squadron name, insignia and paint schemeWhen initially formed, the unit was called the ''Navy Flight Exhibition Team''. The squadron was officially redesignated as the United States Navy Flight Demonstration ''Squadron'' in December 1974. The original team was christened the ''Blue Angels'' in 1946, when one of the pilots came across the name of New York City's Blue Angel Nightclub in ''The New Yorker'' magazine; the team introduced themselves as the "Blue Angels" to the public for the first time on 21 July 1946, in Omaha, Nebraska.The official Blue Angels insignia was designed by then team leader Lt. Cmdr. R. E. "Dusty" Rhodes and Virginia Porter (Illustrator for Naval Air Advanced Training Command), then approved by Chief of Naval Operations in 1949. It is nearly identical to the current design. In the cloud in the upper right quadrant, the aircraft were originally shown heading down and to the right. Over the years, the plane silhouettes have changed along with the squadron's aircraft. Additionally, the lower left quadrant, which contains the Chief of Naval Air Training insignia, has occasionally contained only Naval Aviator wings.Originally, demonstration aircraft were navy blue (nearly black) with gold lettering. The current shades of blue and yellow were adopted when the team transitioned to the Bearcat in 1946. For a single year in 1949, the team performed in an all-yellow scheme with blue markings.Current aircraftWater condensation in the strake vortices of a Hornet during a tight maneuver.The Blues' F/A-18 Hornets are former fleet aircraft that are nearly combat-ready. Modifications to each aircraft include removal of the aircraft gun and replacement with the tank that contains smoke-oil used in demonstrations, and outfitting with the control stick spring system for more precise aircraft control input.  The standard demonstration configuration has a spring tensioned with lb of force installed on the control stick as to allow the pilot minimal room for uncommanded movement. The Blues do not wear G-suits, because the air bladders inside them would repeatedly deflate and inflate, interfering with the control stick between the pilot's legs. Instead, Blue Angel pilots tense their muscles to prevent blood from rushing from their heads and rendering them unconscious."Fat Albert" conducting a Rocket Assisted Take Off.The show's narrator flies Blue Angel 7, a two-seat F/A-18D Hornet, to show sites. The Blues use this jet for backup, and to give demonstration rides to VIP civilians. Three backseats at each show are available; one of them goes to members of the press, the other two to "Key Influencers".  The No.4 slot pilot often flies the No. 7 aircraft in Friday's "practice" shows.The Blue Angels use a United States Marine Corps C-130T Hercules, nicknamed "Fat Albert", for their logistics, carrying spare parts, equipment, and to carry support personnel between shows. Beginning in 1975, "Bert" was used for Jet Assisted Take Off (JATO) and short aerial demonstrations just prior to the main event at selected venues, but the JATO demonstration ended in 2009 due to dwindling supplies of rockets. "Fat Albert Airlines" flies with an all-Marine crew of three officers and five enlisted personnel.Team membersFile:Voris and 1st Blue Angel team 1946.jpg|thumb|The first Blue Angel Flight Demonstration Squadron (1946â€“1947), assembled in front of one of their F6F Hellcats (l to r): Lt.

The demonstration pilots and narrator are made up of Navy and USMC Naval Aviators. Pilots serve two to three years,"Blueangels.navy.mil"and position assignments are made according to team needs, pilot experience levels, and career considerations for members.The officer selection process requires pilots and support officers (flight surgeon, events coordinator, maintenance officer, supply officer, and public affairs officer) wishing to become Blue Angels to apply formally via their chain-of-command, with a personal statement, letters of recommendation and flight records.  Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18 demonstration pilots and naval flight officers are required to have a minimum of 1,250 tactical jet hours and be carrier-qualified.  Marine Corps C-130 demonstration pilots are required to have 1,200 flight hours and be an aircraft commander.Applicants "rush" the team at one or more airshows, paid out of their own finances, and sit in on team briefs and post-show activities and social events.  Rushes are asked to tell a joke prior to the brief, and graded by the team as part of the rigorous selection process.  Team members vote in secret on the next year's members, with no accountability to the higher Navy authority why an applicant was or was not selected.  Selections must be unanimous. There have been female and racial minority staff officers as official Blue Angel members, in support of the Blue Angels recruiting for the Navy and Marine Corps.  The most recent minority Blue Angel pilot was LCDR Keith Hoskins on the 2000 team.  Flight surgeons serve a two-year term, and act as the team recorder during air shows, and help oversee emergency response planning with the various air show planners.  The first female Blue Angel flight surgeon was LT Tamara Schnurr, as a member of the 2001 team.The team leader (#1) is the Commanding Officer and is always a Navy Commander, who may be promoted to Captain mid-tour if approved for Captain by the selection board. Pilots of numbers 2â€“7 are Navy Lieutenants or Lieutenant Commanders, or Marine Corps Captains or Majors. The number 7 pilot narrates for a year, and then typically flies Opposing and then Lead Solo the following two years, respectively. The number 3 pilot moves to the number 4 (slot) position for his second year. Blue Angel No.4 serves as the demonstration safety officer, due largely to the perspective he is afforded from the slot position within the formation, as well as his status as a second-year demonstration pilot. There are a number of other officers in the squadron, including a Naval Flight Officer, the USMC C-130 pilots, a Maintenance Officer, an Administrative Officer, and a Flight Surgeon. Enlisted members range from E-4 to E-9, and perform all maintenance, administrative, and support functions. They serve three to four years in the squadron."Blueangels.navy.mil"After serving with the Blues, members return to fleet assignments.U.S. Navy Blue Angels are :*Flying Blue Angel No.1, Commander Ryan Bernacchi, USN (Commanding Officer/Flight Leader)*Flying Blue Angel No.2, Lieutenant Matt Suyderhoud, USN (Right Wing)*Flying Blue Angel No.3, Lieutenant Lance Benson, USN (Left Wing)*Flying Blue Angel No.4, Lieutenant Andy Talbott, USN (Slot)*Flying Blue Angel No.5, Lieutenant Ryan Chamberlain, USN (Lead Solo)*Flying Blue Angel No.6, Captain Jeff Kuss, USMC (Opposing Solo)*Flying Blue Angel No.7, Lieutenant Tyler Davies, USN (Advance Pilot/Narrator)*Events Coordinator, Blue Angel No.8, Captain Corrie Mays, USMC*Flying Fat Albert, Major Mark Montgomery, USMC*Flying Fat Albert, Major Mark Hamilton, USMC*Flying Fat Albert, Captain Katie Higgins, USMC*Executive Officer, Commander Bob Flynn, USN*Maintenance Officer, Lieutenant Samuel Rose, USN*Flight Surgeon, Lieutenant Commander Joe Schwartz, MC USN*Administrative Officer, Lieutenant junior grade Phillip Harper, USN*Supply Officer, Lieutenant Gregory Bollinger, USN*Public Affairs Officer, Lieutenant Joe Hontz, USNCommanding officerCaptain Tom FroschCapt.

Frosch has more than 3,000 flight hours, 830 carrier arrested landings, and is a graduate of U.S. Naval Test Pilot School aboard NAS Patuxent River, where he subsequently was an F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet test pilot with VX-23 (Air Test and Evaluation Squadron TWO THREE) STRIKE TEST. His decorations include the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, two Meritorious Service Medals, two Individual Air Medals with Combat "V" (Six Strike Flight), three Navy Commendation Medals, one with Combat "V", and numerous unit, campaign and service awards.Training and weekly routineAnnual winter training takes place at NAF El Centro, California, where new and returning pilots hone skills learned in the fleet. During winter training, the pilots fly two practice sessions per day, six days a week, in order to fly the 120 training missions needed to perform the demonstration safely. Separation between the formation of aircraft and their maneuver altitude is gradually reduced over the course of about two months in January and February. The team then returns to their home base in Pensacola, Florida, in March, and continues to practice throughout the show season. A typical week during the season has practices at NAS Pensacola on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. The team then flies to its show venue for the upcoming weekend on Thursday, conducting "circle and arrival" orientation maneuvers upon arrival. The team flies a "practice" airshow at the show site on Friday. This show is attended by invited guests but is often open to the general public. The main airshows are conducted on Saturdays and Sundays, with the team returning home to NAS Pensacola on Sunday evenings after the show. Monday is the Blues' day off.History1940sFile:Blue Angels Vinage Insignia.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.8|The original team insigniaOn 24 April 1946 Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Chester Nimitz issued a directive ordering the formation of a flight exhibition team to boost Navy morale, demonstrate naval air power, and maintain public interest in naval aviation. However, an underlying mission was to help the Navy generate public and political support for a larger allocation of the shrinking defense budget. In April of that year, Rear Admiral Ralph Davison personally selected Lieutenant Commander Roy Marlin "Butch" Voris, a World War II fighter ace, to assemble and train a flight demonstration team, naming him Officer-in-Charge and Flight Leader. Voris selected three fellow instructors to join him (Lt. Maurice "Wick" Wickendoll, Lt. Mel Cassidy, and Lt. Cmdr. Lloyd Barnard, veterans of the War in the Pacific), and they spent countless hours developing the show. The group perfected its initial maneuvers in secret over the Florida Everglades so that, in Voris' words, "if anything happened, just the alligators would know". The team's first demonstration before Navy officials took place on 10 May 1946 and was met with enthusiastic approval.Grumman F6F-5 Hellcats in 1946On 15 June Voris led a trio of Grumman F6F-5 Hellcats, specially modified to reduce weight and painted sea blue with gold leaf trim, through their inaugural 15-minute-long performance at their Florida home base, Naval Air Station Jacksonville."OFFICIAL"The team employed an SNJ Texan, painted and configured to simulate a Japanese Zero, to simulate aerial combat. This aircraft was later painted yellow and dubbed the "Beetle Bomb". This aircraft is said to have been inspired by one of the Spike Jones' ''Murdering the Classics'' series of musical satires, set to the tune (in part) of the William Tell Overture as a thoroughbred horse race scene, [with "Beetle Bomb" being the "trailing horse"] in the lyrics.The team thrilled spectators with low-flying maneuvers performed in tight formations, and (according to Voris) by "keeping something in front of the crowds at all times. My objective was to beat the Army Air Corps. If we did that, we'd get all the other side issues. I felt that if we weren't the best, it would be my naval career." The Blue Angels' first public demonstration also netted the team its first trophy, which sits on display at the team's current home at NAS Pensacola.In 1947 the Blue Angels introduced the famous "diamond" formation.The team soon became known worldwide for its spectacular aerobatic maneuvers. On 25 August 1946 the squadron upgraded their aircraft to the F8F-1 Bearcat. In May 1947, flight leader Lt. Cmdr. Bob Clarke replaced Butch Voris as the leader of the team and introduced the famous Diamond Formation, now considered the Blue Angels' trademark.In 1949, the team acquired a Douglas R4D Sky Train for logistics to and from show sites. The team's SNJ was also replaced by a F8F-1 "Bearcat", painted yellow for the air combat routine, inheriting the "Beetle Bomb" nickname. The Blues transitioned to the straight-wing Grumman F9F-2 Panther on 13 July 1949, wherein the F8F-1 "Beetle Bomb" was relegated to solo aerobatics before the main show, until it crashed on takeoff at a training show in Pensacola in 1950.Team headquarters shifted from NAS Corpus Christi, Texas, to NAAS Whiting Field, Florida, in the fall of 1949, announced 14 July 1949.Fort Walton, Florida, "'''Blue Angels' To Pensacola â€“ Navy Flight Exhibition Team Is Transferred''", Playground News, Thursday 14 July 1949, Volume 4, Number 24, page 2.1950sThe "Blues" continued to perform nationwide until the start of the Korean War in 1950, when (due to a shortage of pilots, and no planes were available) the team was disbanded and its members were ordered to combat duty. Once aboard the aircraft carrier 6 the group formed the core of VF-191, Satan's Kittens.F9F-8 Cougar formation in 1956The Blue Angels were officially recommissioned on 25 October 1951, and reported to NAS Corpus Christi, Texas. Lt. Cdr. Voris was again tasked with assembling the team (he was the first of only two commanding officers to lead them twice). In 1953 the team traded its Sky Train for a Curtiss R5C Commando.The first Marine Corps pilot, Capt Chuck Hiett, joined the team and they relocated to their current home of NAS Pensacola in the winter of 1954. It was here they progressed to the swept-wing Grumman F9F-8 Cougar. In August 1954, "Blues" leader LCDR Ray Hawkins became the first naval aviator to survive an ejection at supersonic speeds when his F9F-6 became uncontrollable on a cross-country flight.File:Grumman F11F-1 Tiger Blue Angels.jpg|thumb|Grumman F11F-1 Tiger, 1957â€“69In September 1956, the team added a sixth aircraft to the flight demonstration in the Opposing Solo position, and gave its first performance outside the United States at the International Air Exposition in Toronto, Canada. It also upgraded its logistics aircraft to the Douglas R5D Skymaster.In January 1957, the team left its winter training facility at Naval Air Facility El Centro, California for a ten-year period. For the next ten years, the team would winter at NAS Key West, Florida. For the 1957 show season, the Blue Angels transitioned to the supersonic Grumman F11F-1 Tiger, first flying the short-nosed, and then the long-nosed versions. The first Six-Plane Delta Maneuvers were added in the 1958 season.1960sIn July 1964, the Blue Angels participated in the Aeronaves de Mexico Anniversary Air Show over Mexico City, Mexico, before an estimated crowd of 1.5million people.In 1965, the Blue Angels conducted a Caribbean island tour, flying at five sites. Later that year, they embarked on a European tour to a dozen sites, including the Paris Air Show, where they were the only team to receive a standing ovation.The ''Blues'' toured Europe again in 1967 touring six sites. In 1968 Skymaster transport aircraft was replaced with a C-121J Constellation. The ''Blues'' transitioned to the two-seat McDonnell Douglas F-4J Phantom II in 1969, nearly always keeping the back seat empty for flight demonstrations. The ''Phantom'' was the only plane to be flown by both the "Blues" and the United States Air Force Thunderbirds. That year they also upgraded to the Lockheed C-121 Super Constellation for logistics.1970sFile:Golden Crown and Blue Angles.jpg|thumb|Members from the Imperial Iranian Air Force Golden Crown and the Blue Angels during the joint airshow; Kushke Nosrat Airbase, 1973The ''Blues'' received their first U.S. Marine Corps Lockheed KC-130F Hercules in 1970. An all-Marine crew manned it. That year, they went on their first South American tour. In 1971, the team conducted its first Far East Tour, performing at a dozen locations in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Guam, and the Philippines. In 1972, the Blue Angels were awarded the Navy's Meritorious Unit Commendation for the two-year period from 1 March 1970 â€“ 31 December 1971. Another European tour followed in 1973, including air shows in Tehran, Iran, England, France, Spain, Turkey, Greece, and Italy.All six Blue Angel A-4F Skyhawks executing a "fleur de lis" maneuver.In December 1974 the Navy Flight Demonstration Team downsized to the subsonic Douglas A-4F Skyhawk II and was reorganized into the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron. This reorganization permitted the establishment of a commanding officer (the flight leader), added support officers, and further redefined the squadron's mission emphasizing the support of recruiting efforts. Commander Tony Less was the squadron's first official commanding officer.1980sOn 8 November 1986 the Blue Angels completed their 40th anniversary year during ceremonies unveiling their present aircraft, the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, the first multi-role fighter/attack aircraft. The power and aerodynamics of the Hornet allows them to perform a slow, high angle of attack "tail sitting" maneuver, and to fly a "dirty" (landing gear down) formation loop, the last of which is not duplicated by the USAF Thunderbirds.Also in 1986, LCDR Donnie Cochran, joined the Blue Angels as the first African-American Naval Aviator to be selected. He would return to lead the team in 1993.File:Blue Angels flying in formation1.jpg|thumb|right|F/A-18s Performing in San Francisco1990sIn 1992 the Blue Angels deployed for a month-long European tour, their first in 19 years, conducting shows in Sweden, Finland, Russia (the first foreign flight demonstration team to perform there), Romania, Bulgaria, Italy, the United Kingdom and Spain.In 1998, CDR Patrick Driscoll made the first "Blue Jet" landing on a "haze gray and underway" aircraft carrier, USS ''Harry S. Truman'' (CVN-75).2000sIn 2006, the Blue Angels marked their 60th year of performing. On 30 October 2008 a spokesman for the team announced that the team would complete its last three performances of the year with five jets instead of six. The change was because one pilot and another officer in the organization had been removed from duty for engaging in an "inappropriate relationship". The Navy stated that one of the individuals was a man and the other a woman, one a Marine and the other from the Navy, and that Rear Admiral Mark Guadagnini, chief of Naval air training, was reviewing the situation. At the next performance at Lackland Air Force Base following the announcement the No.4 or slot pilot, was absent from the formation. A spokesman for the team would not confirm the identity of the pilot removed from the team. On 6 November 2008 both officers were found guilty at an admiral's mast on unspecified charges but the resulting punishment was not disclosed.Scutro, Andrew, "[2 Blue Angels found guilty, await punishment]", ''Military Times'', 8 November 2008. The names of the two members involved were later released on the Pensacola News Journal website/forum as pilot No. 4 USMC Maj. Clint Harris and the administrative officer, Navy Lt. Gretchen Doane., Defensetech.orgFat Albert performed its final JATO demonstration at the 2009 Pensacola Homecoming show, spending their 8 remaining JATO bottles. This demonstration not only was the last JATO performance of the squadron, but also the final JATO profile of the entire U.S. Marine Corps.["End of JATO for Blue Angels!"], blueangels.navy.mil, November 20092010sOn 22 May 2011, the Blue Angels were performing at the Lynchburg Regional Airshow in Lynchburg, Virginia, when the Diamond formation flew the Barrel Roll Break maneuver at an altitude that was lower than the required minimum altitude., YouTube.com The maneuver was aborted, the remainder of the demonstration canceled and all aircraft landed safely. The next day, the Blue Angels announced that they were initiating a safety stand-down, canceling their upcoming Naval Academy Airshow and returning to their home base in Pensacola, Florida, for additional training and airshow practice.[Blue Angels Cancel Naval Academy Airshow]. blueangels.navy.mil. On 26 May, the Blue Angels announced they would not be flying their traditional fly-over of the Naval Academy Graduation Ceremony and that they were canceling their 28â€“29 May 2011 performances at the Millville Wings and Wheels Airshow in Millville, New Jersey.On 27 May 2011, the Blue Angels announced that Commander Dave Koss, the squadron's Commanding Officer, would be stepping down. He was replaced by Captain Greg McWherter, the team's previous Commanding Officer. The squadron canceled performances at the Rockford, Illinois Airfest 4â€“5 June and the Evansville, Indiana Freedom Festival Air Show 11â€“12 June to allow additional practice and demonstration training under McWherter's leadership."cnn2011"Between 2 and 4 September 2011 on Labor Day weekend, the Blue Angels flew for the first time with a 50â€“50 blend of conventional JP-5 jet fuel and a camelina-based biofuel at Naval Air Station Patuxent River airshow at Patuxent River, Maryland.  McWherter flew an F/A-18 test flight on 17 August and stated there were no noticeable differences in performance from inside the cockpit.On 9 April 2013, the U.S. Navy released a statement that it was cancelling all remaining 2013 performances due to budget constraints, which ends the 2013 Blue Angels season after 2 of 35 scheduled shows were performed.  The Navy also stated it continues to believe the value of inspiring future generations,"Navy_Cancels"and that the 2014 Blue Angels Schedule has not been subject to any cancellations, the schedule itself was released in September 2013.In June 2014, Captain Greg McWherter, flight leader of the Blue Angels for 2008-2010 and 2011-2012, received letter of reprimand from Adm. Harry Harris after an admiral's mast for â€œfailing to stop obvious and repeated instances of sexual harassment, condoning widespread lewd practices within the squadron and engaging in inappropriate and unprofessional discussions with his junior officers" during his second tour with the team.In July 2014, Marine Corps Capt. Katie Higgins, 27, became the first female pilot to join the Blue Angels.Aircraft timelineThe "Blues" have flown eight different demonstration aircraft and five support aircraft models:;Demonstration aircraft#Grumman F6F-5 Hellcat: Juneâ€“August 1946#Grumman F8F-1 Bearcat: August 1946 â€“ 1949#Grumman F9F-2 Panther: 1949 â€“ June 1950 (first jet); F9F-5 Panther: 1951 - Winter 1954/55#Grumman F9F-8 Cougar: Winter 1954/55 - mid-season 1957 (swept-wing)#Grumman F11F-1 (F-11) Tiger: mid-season 1957 â€“ 1969 (first supersonic jet)#McDonnell Douglas F-4J Phantom II: 1969 â€“ December 1974#Douglas A-4F Skyhawk: December 1974 â€“ November 1986#McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|McDonnell Douglas F/A-18A/B/C/D Hornet (F/A-18B/D are #7 aircraft): November 1986 â€“ present;Support aircraft#Douglas R4D Skytrain: 1949â€“1955#Curtiss R5C Commando: 1953#Douglas R5D Skymaster: 1956â€“1968#Lockheed C-121 Super Constellation: 1969â€“1973#Lockheed C-130 Hercules "Fat Albert": 1970â€“present;Miscellaneous aircraft#North American SNJ Texan (used to simulate a Japanese A6M Zero aircraft in demonstrations during the late 1940s)#Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star (Used during the 1950s as a VIP transport aircraft for the team)#Vought F7U Cutlass (two of the unusual F7Us were received in late 1952 and flown as a side demonstration during the 1953 season but they were not a part of their regular formations which at the time used the F9F Panther.
