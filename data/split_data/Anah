'''Anah''' or '''Ana''' (, ''ʾĀna''), formerly also known as '''Anna''',1878 is an Iraqi town on the Euphrates river, approximately mid-way between the Gulf of Alexandretta and the Persian Gulf. Anah lies from west to east on the right bank along a bend of the river just before it turns south towards Hīt|Hit.EtymologyNameThe town is called '''Ha-na-atK1''' in a Babylonian letter around 2200bc,1911 '''A-na-at''' by the scribes of Tukulti-Ninurta 885bc, and '''An-at''' by the scribes of Assur-nasir-pal II in 879bc.1911 The name has been connected with the widely-worshipped war goddess Anat.1911 It was known as ''Anathō'' () to Isidore Charax and ''Anatha'' to Ammianus Marcellinus; early Arabic writers described it variously as ''ʾĀna'' or (as if plural) ''ʾĀnāt''.1911HistoryAncientDespite maintaining its name across 42 centuries, the exact location of the settlement seems to have moved from time to time. Sources across most of its early history, however, place Anah on an island in the Euphrates.Its early history under the Babylonians is uncertain. A 3rd-millenniumbc letter mentions six "men of Hanat" are mentioned in a description of disturbances in the Residency of Suhi, which would have included the district of Anah.1911 It is probably not the place mentioned by Amenhotep I in the 16th centurybc or in the speech of Sennacherib's messengers to Hezekiah, but probably was the site "in the middle of the Euphrates" opposite which Assur-nasir-pal II halted during his 879bc campaign.1911 It may also be mentioned in four 7th-centurybc documents edited by Claude Hermann Walter Johns.Xenophon records that the army of Cyrus resupplied during a campaign in 401bc at "Charmande" near the end of a 90-parasang march between Korsote and Pylae,Xenophon, ''Anabasis''. which likely intends Anah. It was the site where Julian first met opposition in his ad363 expedition against Parthia. He got possession of the place and relocated its inhabitants.1911MedievalIn 657, during the Muslim conquest of Iraq, Ali's lieutenants Ziyad and Shureih were refused passage across the Euphrates at Anah. Later, in 1058, Anah was the place of exile of the caliph Qaim when Basisiri was in power. In the 14th century, Anah was the seat of the catholicos who served as primate over the Persian Christians.1911Medieval Arab poets celebrated Anah's wine; in the 14th century, Mustaufi wrote of the fame of its palm groves.In 1574, Leonhart Rauwolff found the town divided into two parts, the Turkish "so surrounded by the river that you cannot go into it but by boats" and the larger Arabian section along one of the banks. In 1610, Texeira said Anah lay on both banks of the river, with which Pietro Della Valle agreed. In that year, Della Valle found the Scot George Strachan resident at Anah, working as the physician to the emir and studying Arabic; he also found some sun worshippers still living there. Della Valle and Texeira called Anah the principal Arab town on the Euphrates, controlling a major route west from Baghdad and territory reaching Palmyra.1911ModernAt the beginning of the 19th century, G.A. Olivier found only 25 men in service of the local prince, with residents fleeing daily to escape from bedouin attacks against which he offered no protection.1807 He described the city as a single long street of five or six miles along a narrow strip of land between the river and a ridge of rocky hills. W.F. Ainsworth, chronicling the English Euphrates expedition, reported that in 1835 the Arabs inhabited the northwest part of the town, the Christians the center, and the Jews the southeast.1888 The same year, the steamer ''Tigris'' went down in a storm just above Anah, near where Julian's force had suffered from a similar storm.1911By the mid-19th century, the houses were separated from one another by fruit gardens, which also filled the riverine islands near the town.1878 The most easterly island contained a ruined castle, while the ruins of ancient Anatho extended a further 2 miles along the left bank.1878 It marked the boundary between the olive (north) and date (south) growing regions in the area.1911 With the positioning of Turkish troops in the town around 1890, the locals no longer had to pay blackmail (''huwwa'') to the bedouins. Through the early 20th century, coarse cotton cloth was the only manufacture.18781911Mosque in AnahF.R. Chesney reported about 1800 houses, 2 mosques, and 16 waterwheels. One minaret is particularly old. Northedge reported the locals commonly attributed it to the 11th century but opined that it was more likely from about a century after that. It rose from one of the islands and belonged to the local mosque. Dr. Muayad Said described it as an octagonal body "enhanced by alcoves, some of which are blind" and noted earlier conservation work undertaken in 1935, 1963 and 1964. When the valley was flooded by the Haditha Dam in 1984 and '85, the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities cut it into sections and removed it to the new Anah, where it was re-erected to a height of  at the end of the 1980s.ISIS has reportedly controlled the town since 2014.Alissa J.
