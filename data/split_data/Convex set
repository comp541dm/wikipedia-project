Illustration of a convex set which looks somewhat like a deformed circle. The (black) line segment joining points x and y lies completely within the (green) set. Since this is true for any points x and y within the set that we might choose, the set is convex.Illustration of a non-convex set. Since the red part of the (black and red) line-segment joining the points x and y lies ''outside'' of the (green) set, the set is non-convex.In Euclidean space, a '''convex set''' is the region such that, for every pair of points within the region, every point on the straight line segment that joins the pair of points is also within the region. For example, a solid cube is a convex set, but anything that is hollow or has a dent in it, for example, a crescent shape, is not convex. A convex curve forms the boundary of a convex set.The notion of a convex set can be generalized to other spaces as described below.In vector spacesA function is convex if and only if its epigraph, the region (in green) above its graph (in blue), is a convex set.Let S be a vector space over the real numbers, or, more generally, some ordered field. This includes Euclidean spaces. A set C in S is said to be '''convex''' if, for all x and y in C and all t in the interval , the point  also belongs to C. In other words, every point on the line segment connecting x and y is in C. This implies that a convex set in a real or complex topological vector space is path-connected, thus connected.Furthermore, C is strictly convex if every point on the line segment connecting x and y other than the endpoints is inside the interior of C.A set C is called absolutely convex if it is convex and balanced.The convex subsets of '''R''' (the set of real numbers) are simply the intervals of '''R'''. Some examples of convex subsets of the Euclidean plane are solid regular polygons, solid triangles, and intersections of solid triangles. Some examples of convex subsets of a Euclidean 3-dimensional space are the Archimedean solids and the Platonic solids. The Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra are examples of non-convex sets.Non-convex set:''"Concave set" redirects here.A set that is not convex is called a ''non-convex set''. A polygon that is not a convex polygon is sometimes called a concave polygon,. and some sources more generally use the term ''concave set'' to mean a non-convex set, but most authorities prohibit this usage.PropertiesIf S is a convex set in n-dimensional space, then for any collection of r, , n-dimensional vectors  in S, and for any nonnegative numbers  such that , then one has::\sum_{k=1}^r\lambda_k u_k \in S.A vector of this type is known as a convex combination of .Intersections and unionsThe collection of convex subsets of a vector space has the following properties:Soltan, Valeriu, ''Introduction to the Axiomatic Theory of Convexity'', ≈ûtiin≈£a, Chi≈üinƒÉu, 1984 (in Russian).#The empty set and the whole vector-space are convex.#The intersection of any collection of convex sets is convex.#The ''union'' of a non-decreasing sequence of convex subsets is a convex set. For the preceding property of unions of non-decreasing sequences of convex sets, the restriction to nested sets is important: The union of two convex sets need ''not'' be convex.Closed convex setsClosed convex sets are convex sets that contain all their limit points. They can be characterised as the intersections of ''closed half-spaces'' (sets of point in space that lie on and to one side of a hyperplane).From what has just been said, it is clear that such intersections are convex, and they will also be closed sets. To prove the converse, i.e., every convex set may be represented as such intersection, one needs the supporting hyperplane theorem in the form that for a given closed convex set C and point P outside it, there is a closed half-space H that contains C and not P. The supporting hyperplane theorem is a special case of the Hahn‚ÄìBanach theorem of functional analysis.Convex sets and rectanglesLet C be a convex body in the plane. We can inscribe a rectangle r in C such that a homothetic copy R of r is circumscribed about C. The positive homothety ratio is at most 2 and:::\tfrac{1}{2} \cdot\text{Area}(R) \leq \text{Area}(C) \leq 2\cdot \text{Area}(r)Convex hulls and Minkowski sumsConvex hullsconvex hullEvery subset A of the vector space is contained within a smallest convex set (called the convex hull of A), namely the intersection of all convex sets containing A. The convex-hull operator Conv() has the characteristic properties of a hull operator::{| border="0"|-| ''extensive''| ,|-| ''non-decreasing''|  implies that , and|-| ''idempotent''| .|}The convex-hull operation is needed for the set of convex sets to form a ;;lattice, in which the "''join''" operation is the convex hull of the union of two convex sets: .The intersection of any collection of convex sets is itself convex, so the convex subsets of a (real or complex) vector space form a complete lattice.Minkowski additionMinkowski additionFile:Minkowski sum.png|thumb|alt=Three squares are shown in the nonnegative quadrant of the Cartesian plane. The square  is green. The square .|Minkowski addition of sets. The ;;sum of the squaresQ1=[0,1]2 andQ2=[1,2]2 is the squareQ1+Q2=[1,3]2.In a real vector-space, the ''Minkowski sum'' of two (non-empty) sets,  and , is defined to be the set  formed by the addition of vectors element-wise from the summand-sets:.More generally, the ''Minkowski sum'' of a finite family of (non-empty) sets  is ;; the set ;; formed by element-wise addition of vectors;;: \sum_n S_n = \left \{ \sum_n x_n : x_n \in S_n \right \}.For Minkowskiaddition, the ''zero set''containing only the null vector|zerovector0 has special importance: For every non-empty subsetS of a vector space:;in algebraic terminology,  is the identity element of Minkowski addition (on the collection of non-empty sets).The empty set is important in Minkowski addition, because the empty set annihilates every other subset: For every subset S of a vector space, its sum with the empty set is empty: .Convex hulls of Minkowski sumsMinkowski addition behaves well with respect to the operation of taking convex hulls, as shown by the following proposition:Let  be subsets of a real vector-space, the convex hull of their Minkowski sum is the Minkowski sum of their convex hulls:.This result holds more generally for each finite collection of non-empty sets::\text{Conv}\left ( \sum_n S_n \right ) = \sum_n \text{Conv} \left (S_n \right).In mathematical terminology, the operations of Minkowski summation and of forming convex hulls are commuting operations.Theorem3 (pages562‚Äì563): For the commutativity of Minkowski addition and convexification, see Theorem1.1.2 (pages2‚Äì3) in Schneider; this reference discusses much of the literature on the convex hulls of Minkowski sumsets in its "Chapter3 Minkowski addition" (pages126‚Äì196):Minkowski sums of convex setsThe Minkowski sum of two compact convex sets is compact. the sum of a compact convex set and a closed convex set is closed.Lemma5.3:Generalizations and extensions for convexityThe notion of convexity in the Euclidean space may be generalized by modifying the definition in some or other aspects. The common name "generalized convexity" is used, because the resulting objects retain certain properties of convex sets.Star-convex setsStar domainLet C be a set in a real or complex vector space. C is '''star convex''' if there exists an  in C such that the line segment from  to any point y in C is contained in C. Hence a non-empty convex set is always star-convex but a star-convex set is not always convex.Orthogonal convexityOrthogonal convex hullAn example of generalized convexity is '''orthogonal convexity'''.Rawlins G.J.E. and Wood D, "Ortho-convexity and its generalizations",  in: ''Computational Morphology'', 137-152. Elsevier, 1988.A set S in the Euclidean space is called '''orthogonally convex''' or '''ortho-convex''', if any segment parallel to any of the coordinate axes connecting two points of S lies totally within S. It is easy to prove that an intersection of any collection of orthoconvex sets is orthoconvex. Some other properties of convex sets are  valid as well.Non-Euclidean geometryThe definition of a convex set and a convex hull extends naturally to geometries which are not Euclidean by defining a geodesically convex set to be one that contains the geodesics joining any two points in the set.Order topologyConvexity can be extended for a space X endowed with the order topology, using the total order  of the space.Munkres, James; ''Topology'', Prentice Hall; 2nd edition (December 28, 1999). ISBN 0-13-181629-2.Let . The subspace Y is a convex set if for each pair of points ''a'', ''b'' in Y such that , the interval  is contained in Y. That is, Y is convex if and only if for all ''a'', ''b'' in Y,  implies .Convexity spacesThe notion of convexity may be generalised to other objects, if certain properties of convexity are selected as axioms.Given a set X, a '''convexity''' over X is a collection {{math|''ùíû''}} of subsets of X satisfying the following axioms:"Soltan""Singer"#The empty set and X are in {{math|''ùíû''}}#The intersection of any collection from {{math|''ùíû''}} is in {{math|''ùíû''}}.#The union of a chain (with respect to the inclusion relation) of elements of {{math|''ùíû''}} is in {{math|''ùíû''}}.The elements of {{math|''ùíû''}} are called convex sets and the pair {{math|(''X'', ''ùíû'')}} is called a '''convexity space'''. For the ordinary convexity, the first two axioms hold, and the third one is trivial.For an alternative definition of abstract convexity, more suited to discrete geometry, see the ''convex geometries'' associated with antimatroids.See also* Concave set* Convex curve* Convex function* Convex metric space* Convex optimization* Carath√©odory's theorem (convex hull)* Choquet theory* Helly's theorem* Holomorphically convex hull* Pseudoconvexity* Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemmaReferencesExternal links*
