Woods, which they adapted for the screen from the novel and play ''The Clansman: An Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan'' by Thomas Dixon, Jr. Collection National Film Registry.Griffith on the set of ''The Birth of a Nation'' (1915) with actor Henry Walthall and others.'''''The Birth of a Nation''''' (originally called ''The Clansman'') is a 1915 American silent epic drama film directed by D. W. Griffith and starring Lillian Gish. The screenplay is adapted from the novel and play ''The Clansman'', both by Thomas Dixon, Jr. Griffith co-wrote the screenplay (with Frank E. Woods), and co-produced the film (with Harry Aitken). It was released on February 8, 1915. Over two hours long, the film was originally presented in two parts separated by an intermission; it was the first 12-reel film in America.The film chronicles the relationship of two families in the American Civil War and Reconstruction era: the pro-Union Northern Stonemans and the pro-Confederacy Southern Camerons over the course of several years. The assassination of President Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth is dramatized.The film was a commercial success, though it was highly controversial owing to its portrayal of black men (some played by white actors in blackface) as unintelligent and sexually aggressive towards white women, and the portrayal of the Ku Klux Klan (whose original founding is dramatized) as a heroic force.   There were widespread African-American protests against ''The Birth of a Nation'', such as in Boston, while thousands of white Bostonians flocked to see the film. The NAACP spearheaded an unsuccessful campaign to ban the film."NAACP"Griffith's indignation at efforts to censor or ban the film motivated him to produce ''Intolerance'' the following year.The film is also credited as one of the events that inspired the formation of the "second era" Ku Klux Klan at Stone Mountain, Georgia, in the same year. ''The Birth of a Nation'', along with the trial and lynching of Leo Frank for the 1913 murder of Mary Phagan in Atlanta, was used as a recruiting tool for the KKK. Under President Woodrow Wilson it was the first American motion picture to be screened at the White House, although in 1914 the Italian film ''Cabiria'' had been shown on the White House lawn.Kennedy, Ross A.

Phil, the elder Stoneman son, falls in love with Margaret Cameron, while young Ben Cameron idolizes a picture of Elsie Stoneman. When the Civil War begins, these young men enlist in their respective armies.A black militia acting under a white leader ransacks the Cameron house; the Cameron women are rescued by Confederate soldiers who rout the militia. Meanwhile, the younger Stoneman and two of the Cameron brothers are killed in the war.  Ben Cameron is wounded after a heroic charge at the Siege of Petersburg; as a result, he earns the nickname "the Little Colonel." He is taken to a Northern hospital in Washington, D.C., where he at last meets the Elsie Stoneman of the picture he has been carrying; she is working there as a nurse. While recovering, Cameron is told that he will be hanged for being a Confederate guerrilla. Elsie takes Cameron's mother, who had traveled to Washington to tend her son, to see Abraham Lincoln, and the mother persuades the president to issue a pardon to Ben Cameron.When Lincoln is assassinated at Ford's Theater, his conciliatory postwar policy expires with him. In the wake of the president's death, and with a power vacuum having opened up, Austin Stoneman and his fellow radical congressmen are determined to carry out their desire to punish the South, employing harsh measures that Griffith depicts as having been typical of the Reconstruction era.Griffith followed the then-dominant Dunning School or "Tragic Era" view of Reconstruction presented by early 20th-century historians such as William Archibald Dunning and Claude G. Bowers. Stokes 2007, pp. 190–191.Part 2: ReconstructionBattle scene from ''The Birth of a Nation''Stoneman and his protégé Silas Lynch, a mulatto exhibiting psychopathic characteristics, travel to South Carolina to observe the implementation of Reconstruction policies firsthand. Black occupation soldiers are seen parading through the streets and pushing white residents aside on the sidewalks. During the election, in which Lynch is elected lieutenant governor, whites are seen being prevented from voting while blacks are observed stuffing the ballot boxes. The newly elected, mostly black members of the South Carolina legislature are shown at their desks displaying inappropriate behavior, such as one member taking off his shoe and putting his feet up on his desk, and others drinking liquor and feasting on stereotypically African American fare such as fried chicken. The legislature passes laws requiring white civilians to salute black soldiers and allowing mixed-race marriages.Meanwhile, inspired by observing white children pretending to be ghosts to scare black children, Ben fights back by forming the Ku Klux Klan. As a result, Elsie, out of loyalty to her father, breaks off her relationship with Ben. Later, Flora Cameron goes off alone into the woods to fetch water and is followed by Gus, a freedman and soldier who is now a captain. He confronts Flora and tells her that he desires to get married. Frightened, she flees into the forest, pursued by Gus. Trapped on a precipice, Flora warns Gus she will jump if he comes any closer. When he does, she leaps to her death. Having run through the forest looking for her, Ben has seen her jump; he holds her as she dies, then carries her body back to the Cameron home. In response, the Klan hunts down Gus, tries him, finds him guilty, lynches him, and delivers his corpse to Lt. Gov. Lynch's doorstep.Lynch then orders a crackdown on the Klan. Dr. Cameron, Ben's father, is arrested for possessing Ben's Klan costume, now considered a crime punishable by death. His faithful black servants rescue him with help from Phil Stoneman. Together they flee, along with Margaret Cameron. When their wagon breaks down, they make their way through the woods to a small hut that is home to two sympathetic former Union soldiers who agree to hide them.  As an intertitle states, "The former enemies of North and South are united again in defense of their Aryan birthright."Congressman Stoneman leaves to avoid being connected with Lt. Gov. Lynch's crackdown. Elsie, learning of Dr. Cameron's arrest, goes to Lynch to plead for his release. Lynch, who had been lusting after Elsie, tries to force her to marry him, which causes her to faint. Stoneman returns, causing Elsie to be placed in another room.  At first, Stoneman is happy when Lynch tells him he wants to marry a white woman, but is then angered when Lynch tells him that it is Stoneman's daughter. Undercover Klansmen spies discover Elsie's plight when she breaks a window and cries out for help, and the Klansmen go to get help. Elsie falls unconscious again, and revives while gagged and being bound. The Klan, gathered together at full strength and with Ben leading them, rides in to regain control of the town. When news about Elsie reaches Ben, he and others go to her rescue. Elsie frees her mouth and screams for help. Lynch is captured. Victorious, the Klansmen celebrate in the streets. Meanwhile, Lynch's militia surrounds and attacks the hut where the Camerons are hiding. The Klansmen, with Ben at their head, race in to save them just in time.The next election day, blacks find a line of mounted and armed Klansmen just outside their homes, and are intimidated into not voting. The film concludes with a double wedding as Margaret Cameron marries Phil Stoneman and Elsie Stoneman marries Ben Cameron. The masses are shown oppressed by a giant warlike figure who gradually fades away. The scene shifts to another group finding peace under the image of Jesus Christ. The penultimate title rhetorically asks: "Dare we dream of a golden day when the bestial War shall rule no more? But instead ;mdash; the gentle Prince in the Hall of Brotherly Love in the City of Peace."Cast* Lillian Gish as Elsie Stoneman* Mae Marsh as Flora Cameron, the pet sister* Henry B.

Gus was portrayed in blackface by white actor Walter Long.''The Birth of a Nation'' began filming in 1914 and pioneered such camera techniques as the use of panoramic long shots, the iris effects, still-shots, night photography, panning camera shots, and a carefully staged battle sequence with hundreds of extras made to look like thousands. It also contains many new artistic techniques, such as color tinting for dramatic purposes, building up the plot to an exciting climax, dramatizing history alongside fiction, and featuring its own musical score written for an orchestra.When the film was released, it shattered both box office and film-length records, running three hours and ten minutes. In 1998, it was voted one of the "Top 100 American Films" (#44) by the American Film Institute.The film was based on Thomas Dixon, Jr.'s novels ''The Clansman'' and ''The Leopard's Spots''. It was originally to have been shot in Kinemacolor but D. W. Griffith took over the Hollywood studio of Kinemacolor and Kinemacolor's plans to film Dixon's novel. Griffith, whose father served as a colonel in the Confederate Army, agreed to pay Thomas Dixon $10,000 (equal to $ today) for the rights to his play ''The Clansman''. Since he ran out of money and could afford only $2,500 of the original option, Griffith offered Dixon 25 percent interest in the picture. Dixon reluctantly agreed, and the unprecedented success of the film made him rich. Dixon's proceeds were the largest sum any author had received for a motion picture story and amounted to several million dollars.Griffith's budget started at US$40,000 (equal to $ today) but rose to over $100,000"Hall ; Neale (2010)"; (the equivalent of $ in constant dollars).USWest Point engineers provided technical advice on the Civil War battle scenes. They provided Griffith with the artillery used in the film.Seelye, Katharine Q. "When Hollywood's Big Guns Come Right From the Source", ''The New York Times'', June 10, 2002. Some scenes from the movie were filmed on the porches and lawns of Homewood Plantation in Natchez, Mississippi.The film premiered on February 8, 1915, at Clune's Auditorium in downtown Los Angeles. At its premiere the film was entitled ''The Clansman,'' but the title was later changed to ''The Birth of a Nation'' to reflect Griffith's belief that the United States emerged from the American Civil War and Reconstruction as a unified nation.[Dirks, Tim, ''The Birth of a Nation'', filmsite.org] Retrieved May 27, 2010.The film is in the public domain.["The Birth of a Nation" at the Internet Archive]. Retrieved August 2, 2009.ScoreSheet music for "The Perfect Song", one of the themes Breil composed for the film.Although ''The Birth of a Nation'' is commonly regarded as a landmark for its dramatic and visual innovations, its use of music was arguably no less revolutionary.Hickman 2006, p. 77. Though film was still silent at the time, it was common practice to distribute musical cue sheets, or less commonly, full scores (usually for organ or piano accompaniment) along with each print of a film.Hickman 2006, pp. 68–69.For ''The Birth of a Nation'', composer Joseph Carl Breil created a three-hour-long musical score that combined all three types of music in use at the time: adaptations of existing works by classical composers, new arrangements of well-known melodies, and original composed music."hickman77"Though it had been specifically composed for the film, Breil's score was not used for the Los Angeles première of the film at Clune's Auditorium; rather, a score compiled by Carli Elinor was performed in its stead, and this score was used exclusively in West Coast showings. Breil's score was not used until the film debuted in New York at the Liberty Theatre, and was the score utilized in all showings save those on the West Coast."hickman78""marks-1997"Outside of original compositions, Breil adapted classical music for use in the film, including passages from ''Der Freischütz'' by Carl Maria von Weber, ''Leichte Kavallerie'' by Franz von Suppé, Symphony No. 6 by Ludwig van Beethoven, and ''Ride of the Valkyries'' by Richard Wagner, the latter used as a leitmotif during the ride of the KKK."hickman77"Breil also arranged several traditional and popular tunes that would have been recognizable to audiences at the time, including many Southern melodies; among these songs were "Maryland, My Maryland", "Dixie", "Old Folks at Home", "The Star-Spangled Banner", "America the Beautiful", "The Battle Hymn of the Republic", "Auld Lang Syne", and "Where Did You Get That Hat?"."hickman77"In his original compositions for the film, Breil wrote numerous leitmotifs to accompany the appearance of specific characters. The principal love theme that was created for the romance between Elsie Stoneman and Ben Cameron was published as "The Perfect Song" and is regarded as the first marketed "theme song" from a film; it was later even used as the theme song for the popular radio and television sitcom ''Amos 'n' Andy''.Hickman 2006, p. 78.Responses and receptionPoster and advertisement of ''The Birth of a Nation'' on the second week of release. It includes preview images from the film.The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), founded in 1909, protested premieres of the film in numerous cities. According to the historian David Copeland, "by the time of the movie's March 3 [1915] premiere in New York City, its subject matter had embroiled the film in charges of racism, protests, and calls for censorship, which began after the Los Angeles branch of the NAACP requested the city's film board ban the movie. Since film boards were composed almost entirely of whites, few review boards initially banned Griffith's picture". The NAACP also conducted a public education campaign, publishing articles protesting the film's fabrications and inaccuracies, organizing petitions against it, and conducting education on the facts of the war and Reconstruction.[NAACP – Timeline]Because of the lack of success in NAACP's actions to ban the film, on April 17, 1915, NAACP secretary Mary Childs Nerney wrote to NAACP Executive Committee member George Packard: "I am utterly disgusted with the situation in regard to ''The Birth of a Nation'' ... kindly remember that we have put six weeks of constant effort of this thing and have gotten nowhere."Jane Addams, an American social worker and social reformer, and the founder of Hull House, voiced her reaction to the film in an interview published by the ''New York Post'' on March 13, 1915, just ten days after the film was released. She stated that "One of the most unfortunate things about this film is that it appeals to race prejudice upon the basis of conditions of half a century ago, which have nothing to do with the facts we have to consider to-day. Even then it does not tell the whole truth. It is claimed that the play is historical: but history is easy to misuse.""Stokes_432"When the film was released, riots broke out in Boston, Philadelphia and other major cities in the United States. The film's inflammatory nature was a catalyst for gangs of whites to attack blacks. On 24 April 1916, the Chicago American reported that a white man murdered a black teenager in Lafayette, Indiana after seeing the film, although there has been some controversy as to whether the murderer had actually seen ''The Birth of a Nation''.Gallen, Ira H. ; Stern Seymour. ''D.W. Griffith's 100th Anniversary The Birth of A Nation'' (2014) p.47f. The mayor of Cedar Rapids, Iowa was the first of twelve mayors to ban the film in 1915 out of concern that it would promote race prejudice, after meeting with a delegation of black citizens. The NAACP set up a precedent-setting national boycott of the film, likely seen as the most successful effort. Additionally, they organised a mass demonstration when the film was screened in Boston, and it was banned in three states and several cities.Thomas Dixon, Jr., author of ''The Birth of a Nation''s source play and novel ''The Clansman'', was a former classmate of then-president Woodrow Wilson at Johns Hopkins University. Dixon managed to arrange a screening of ''The Birth of a Nation'' at the White House for Wilson, members of his cabinet, and their families, in what was at the time one of the firsts ever screenings at the White House. Wilson was falsely reported to have said about the film, "It is like writing history with lightning. And my only regret is that it is all so terribly true". Wilson's aide, Joseph Tumulty, denied the claims and said that "the President was entirely unaware of the nature of the play before it was presented and at no time has expressed his approbation of it." Historians believe the quote attributed to Wilson originated with Dixon, who was relentless in publicizing the film. After controversy over the film had grown, Wilson wrote that he disapproved of the "unfortunate production."Griffith, indignant at the film's negative critical reception, wrote letters to newspapers, and published a pamphlet in which he accused his critics of censoring unpopular opinions.Mayer, David (2009). ''Stagestruck Filmmaker: D.W. Griffith ; the American Theatre''. University of Iowa Press. p. 166. ISBN 1587297906. When Sherwin Lewis for the New York Globe wrote a critical piece that expressed criticism towards the distorted portrayal of the history and that it was not worth being constitutionally protecting because it was to make a few "dirty dollars", Griffith responded that "the public should not be afraid to accept the truth, even though it might not like it". He also added to say that the man who wrote the editorial was "damaging my reputation as a producer" and "a liar and a coward". He conceived his next film, ''Intolerance'' (1916), as a response to those who had censored his film."Mayer_166"Despite the film's controversy, ''The Birth of a Nation'' was critically well-received and very popular. At over three hours in length (including intermissions), the film was ground-breaking in its production value, budget and ambition. At the time, the film was unlike anything the American audiences had ever seen before.Box office performanceThe box office gross of ''The Birth of a Nation'' is not known, and was long subject to exaggeration.Aberdeen, J. A. [Distribution: States Rights or Road Show"], Hollywood Renegades Archive. Retrieved May 2, 2014. At the end of 1917 Epoch reported to its shareholders cumulative receipts of $4.8 million,"Schickel_281"and Griffith's own records put Epoch's worldwide earnings from the film at $5.2 million as of 1919, although the distributor's share of the revenue at this time was much lower than the exhibition gross. In the biggest cities, Epoch negotiated with individual theater owners for a percentage of the box office; elsewhere the producer sold all rights in a particular state to a single distributor (an arrangement known as "state's rights" distribution). The film historian Richard Schickel says that under the state's rights contracts, Epoch typically received about 10% of the box office gross—which theater owners often underreported—and concludes that "''Birth'' certainly generated more than $60 million in box-office business in its first run". By 1940 ''Time'' magazine estimated the film's cumulative gross rental (the distributor's earnings) at approximately $15 million. For years ''Variety'' had the gross rental listed as $50 million, but in 1977 repudiated the claim and revised its estimate down to $5 million."Schickel_281"It is not known for sure how much the film has earned in total, but producer Harry Aitken put its estimated earnings at $15–18 million in a letter to a prospective investor in a proposed sound version;"Wasko"it is likely the film earned over $20 million for its backers, and generated $50–100 million in box office receipts.The film played at the Liberty Theater in New York City for 44 weeks and tickets were priced at $2.20 ($51.50 in 2015 dollars).Sequel, appropriations, and spin-offsD. W. Griffith made a film in 1916, called ''Intolerance'', partly in response to the criticism that ''Birth Of A Nation'' received. Griffith has made clear within numerous interviews that the film's title and main themes were chosen in response to those who Griffith felt had been intolerant to his ''Birth Of A Nation''.A sequel called ''The Fall of a Nation'' was released in 1916. It was the first sequel in film history. The film was directed by Thomas Dixon, Jr., who adapted it from his own novel of the same name. The film has three acts and a prologue.The Fall of a Nation (1916)  Despite its success in the foreign market, the film was not a success among the American audiences.  It is believed that it is now a lost film.In 1918, an American silent drama film directed by John W. Noble called ''The Birth of a Race'' was released as a direct response to ''The Birth of a Nation''. The film was an ambitious project by producer Emmett Jay Scott to challenge Griffith's film and tell another side of the story, but was ultimately unsuccessful.In 1919, the director/producer/writer Oscar Micheaux released ''Within Our Gates'', a response from the African-American community. Notably, he reversed a key scene of Griffith's film by depicting a white man assaulting a black woman.The film was remixed in 2004 as ''Rebirth of a Nation'', a live cinema experience by DJ Spooky at Lincoln Center, and has toured at many venues around the world including The Acropolis as a live cinema "remix". The remix version was also presented at Paula Cooper Gallery in New York.In 2016, Nate Parker produced and directed the film The Birth of a Nation (2016 film), a story of a slave boy who becomes a leader through education and preaching. Parker states: " I've reclaimed this title and re-purposed it as a tool to challenge racism and white supremacy in America, to inspire a riotous disposition toward any and all injustice in this country (and abroad) and to promote the kind of honest confrontation that will galvanize our society toward healing and sustained systemic change."Ideology and accuracyWoodrow Wilson's ''History of the American People'' is quoted in ''The Birth of a Nation''.The film remains controversial due to its interpretation of American history. University of Houston historian Steven Mintz summarizes its message as follows: Reconstruction was a disaster, blacks could never be integrated into white society as equals, and the violent actions of the Ku Klux Klan were justified to reestablish honest government.[UG.edu], Digital History. The South is portrayed as a victim. The first overt mentioning of the war is the scene in which Abraham Lincoln signs the call for the first 75,000 volunteers. However, the first aggression in the Civil War, made when the Confederate troops fired on Fort Sumter in 1861, is not mentioned in the film.  The film suggested that the Ku Klux Klan restored order to the postwar South, which was depicted as endangered by abolitionists, freedmen, and carpetbagging Republican politicians from the North. This reflects the so-called Dunning School of historiography.Stokes 2007, pp. 190–91. The film portrays President Abraham Lincoln as a friend of the Confederacy, and refers to him as "the Great Heart".  The two romances depicted in the film,  Phil Stoneman with Margaret Cameron and Ben Cameron with Elsie Stoneman, reflect Griffith's retelling of history.  The couples are used as a metaphor, representing the film's broader message of the need for the reconciliation of the North and South to defend white supremacy. Among both couples, there is an attraction that forms before the war, stemming from the friendship between their families.  With the war, though, both families are split apart, and their losses culminate in the end of the war with the defense of white supremacy.  One of the intertitles clearly sums up the message of unity, stating, "The former enemies of North and South are united again in defense of their Aryan birthright."Some historians, such as E. Merton Coulter in his ''The South Under Reconstruction'' (1947), maintained the Dunning School view after World War II. Today, the Dunning School position is largely seen as a product of anti-black racism of the early 20th century, by which many Americans held that black Americans were unequal as citizens.Veteran film reviewer Roger Ebert wrote,Despite some similarities between the Congressman Stoneman character and  Rep. Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania, Rep. Stevens did not have the family members described and did not move to South Carolina during Reconstruction. He died in Washington, D.C. in 1868. However, Stevens was widely rumored to keep a biracial mistress-housekeeper, who was generously provided for in his will.Marc Egnal, ''Clash of Extremes'', 2009.The depictions of mass Klan paramilitary actions do not seem to have historical equivalents, although there were incidents in 1871 where Klan groups traveled from other areas in fairly large numbers to aid localities in disarming local companies of the all-black portion of the state militia under various justifications, prior to the eventual Federal troop intervention, and the organized Klan's continued activities as small groups of "night riders."West, Jerry Lee. ''The Reconstruction Ku Klux Klan in York County, South Carolina, 1865–1877'' (2002) p. 67The Civil Rights Movement and other social movements created a new generation of historians, such as scholar Eric Foner, who led a reassessment of Reconstruction. Building on W.E.B. DuBois' work but also adding new sources, they focused on achievements of the African-American and white Republican coalitions, such as establishment of universal public education and charitable institutions in the South and extension of suffrage to black men. In response, the Southern-dominated Democratic Party and its affiliated white militias had used extensive terrorism, intimidation and outright assassinations to suppress African-American leaders and voting in the 1870s and to regain power.Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War''. New York: Farrar Straus and Giroux, 2006, p. 150-154SignificanceFile:Nation walsh.jpg|thumb|Raoul Walsh as John Wilkes BoothReleased in 1915, ''The Birth of a Nation'' has been credited as groundbreaking among its contemporaries for its innovative application of the medium of film. According to the film historian Kevin Brownlow, the film was "astounding in its time" and initiated "so many advances in film-making technique that it was rendered obsolete within a few years." The content of the work, however, has received widespread criticism for its blatantly racist and fantastical depictions of scenes that are presented onscreen as if in documentary form. Film critic Roger Ebert writes, "Certainly ''The Birth of a Nation'' (1915) presents a challenge for modern audiences. Unaccustomed to silent films and uninterested in film history, they find it quaint and not to their taste. Those evolved enough to understand what they are looking at find the early and wartime scenes brilliant, but cringe during the postwar and Reconstruction scenes, which are racist in the ham-handed way of an old minstrel show or a vile comic pamphlet." ''"Birth of a Nation'' was the first picture that really made people take the motion picture industry seriously," said Mary Pickford.The film held the mantle of the highest grossing film until it was overtaken by ''Gone with the Wind''.In 1992, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. Despite its controversial story, the film has been praised by film critics such as Roger Ebert, who said: "''The Birth of a Nation'' is not a bad film because it argues for evil. Like Riefenstahl's ''Triumph of the Will'', it is a great film that argues for evil. To understand how it does so is to learn a great deal about film, and even something about evil."EbertThe website ''Rotten Tomatoes'', which compiles reviews from various sources, indicates the film has a 100% approval rating.According to a 2002 article in the ''Los Angeles Times'', the film facilitated the refounding of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s., A Painful Present as Historians Confront a Nation's Bloody Past. As late as the 1970s, the Ku Klux Klan continued to use the film as a recruitment tool.'''American Film Institute recognition'''* AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (1997) – #44New opening titles on re-releaseOne famous part of the film was added by Griffith only on the second run of the film and is missing from most online versions of the film (presumably taken from first run prints.)This includes the one at the Internet Movie Archive  and the Google video copy  and Veoh [Watch Videos Online | The Birth of a Nation | Veoh.com]. However, of multiple YouTube copies one which has the full opening titles is DW GRIFFITH THE BIRTH OF A NATION PART 1 1915These are the second and third of three opening title cards which defend the film. The added titles read:A PLEA FOR THE ART OF THE MOTION PICTURE:We do not fear censorship, for we have no wish to offend with improprieties or obscenities, but we do demand, as a right, the liberty to show the dark side of wrong, that we may illuminate the bright side of virtue – the same liberty that is conceded to the art of the written word – that art to which we owe the Bible and the works of Shakespeare;/blockquote;andIf in this work we have conveyed to the mind the ravages of war to the end that war may be held in abhorrence, this effort will not have been in vain.;/blockquote;Various film historians have expressed a range of views about these titles. To Nicholas Andrew Miller, this shows that "Griffith's greatest achievement in ''The Birth of a Nation'' was that he brought the cinema's capacity for spectacle... under the rein of an outdated, but comfortably literary form of historical narrative. Griffith's models... are not the pioneers of film spectacle... but the giants of literary narrative." On the other hand, S. Kittrell Rushing complains about Griffith's "didactic" title-cards, while Stanley Corkin complains that Griffith "masks his idea of fact in the rhetoric of high art and free expression" and creates film which "erodes the very ideal" of "liberty" which he asserts.Home media and restorations''Birth of a Nation,'' even more than other films in the public domain, has been poorly represented in later releases. The problem, in part, is that Griffith and others have reworked the film, leaving no definitive version. According to the silent film website ''Brenton Film'', "there are a multitude of poor quality DVDs with different edits, scores, running speeds and usually in ''definitely unoriginal'' black and white."There are exceptions. Among them is film preservationist David Shepard's 1992 transfer of a 16mm print for VHS and laserdisc release via Image Entertainment. A short documentary, ''The Making of The Birth of a Nation'', newly produced and narrated by Shepard, was also included. Both were released on DVD by Image in 1998 and the UK's Eureka Entertainment in 2000."Brenton Film"In the UK, Photoplay Productions restored the Museum of Modern Art's 35mm print that was the source of Shepard's 16mm print, though they also augmented it with extra material from the British Film Institute.
