2010German on average?I was at a public lecture by M. at the Australian National University twenty years ago.  The host introduced him by saying that he had been born in Poland, and raised in France, and so was "on average German".  M opened by saying that the host had stolen his joke.If indeed M. has/does use this line, I think that it would be worth a mention in the article.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/141.243.60.12|141.243.60.12 (talk) 23:55, 11 November 2007 (UTC);;; ;;Is Mandelbrot his real name ?Its rather strange that anyone would call them self Mandelbrot ( Almond bread ).And its also somewhat unusual with a german name ( though it occurs )to some born in Poland.Special:Contributions/80.197.37.86|80.197.37.86 (talk) 15:01, 29 March 2015 (UTC)Speaking of jokes, this one buried in Note 1 seems out of place.;He [sometimes?] included "B" as a middle initial, which stands for "Benoit B Mandelbrot".;If he himself used this joke (and I must say it's a good one), perhaps it should be placed with the "on average German" one to show his sense of humor. A word as to whether the middle initial "B" is real, or just for the sake of the joke, would be appropriate as well.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/137.79.194.251|137.79.194.251 (talk) 17:10, 9 December 2015 (UTC);;; ;;:His listing at the [math.yale.edu/ site] gives his name as "Benoit B.

Please take a moment to review . If necessary, add cbignore after the link to keep me from modifying it. Alternatively, you can add  to keep me off the page altogether. I made the following changes:*Added archive to *Added archive https://web.archive.org/20101019233754/toWhen you have finished reviewing my changes, please set the ''checked'' parameter below to '''true''' to let others know.Cheers. —User:Cyberbot II|cyberbot IIUser talk:Cyberbot II|Talk to my owner:Online;15:26, 25 August 2015 (UTC)Traded Clothes?"His family was Jewish and had a strong academic tradition — his mother was a dental surgeon, and his father made his living trading clothing"Trading clothing now requires a degree of some kind?Perhaps the sentence ought to read 'although his father etc.'As it stands, the sentence lies somewhere between clumsy and comic, almost as though Woody Allen had authored it:'Mandelbrot's father was a brilliant rocket scientist, though his mother still had to take in washing.''Mandelbrot's mother was a mathematician of international repute,  while his father mended shoes and danced for throw-money outside movie theatres.' Special:Contributions/121.44.223.71|121.44.223.71 (talk) 21:34, 30 August 2015 (UTC)I agree completely with the above comment. This sentence is really jarring. I would also note that being Jewish and the family's academic tradition are two different ideas. I propose changing:"His family was Jewish and had a strong academic tradition — his mother was a dental surgeon, and his father made his living trading clothing."to:"His family was Jewish. Although his father made his living trading clothing, the family had a strong academic tradition and his mother was a dental surgeon."Any objections or comments?:The suggested phrasing would be a good improvement. --Light show (talk) 18:48, 5 January 2016 (UTC)::Of course the unsigned commenter is correct.

Whether the correct term is "discovered" or "invented" is a POV question.: — Arthur Rubin  (talk) 01:14, 21 September 2015 (UTC)As a non-expert reader, the chronology of the discovery of the Mandelbrot set in this article seems suspect.  This article mentions Mandelbrot "discovering the Mandelbrot set in 1979."  Confusingly, a few lines down it says that "He later discovered the Mandelbrot set . . . named in his honor".   The chronology in the Mandelbrot Set article seems more believable.  It states that "This fractal was first defined and drawn in 1978 by Robert W. Brooks and Peter Matelski". and that "on 1 March 1980 . . . Benoit Mandelbrot first saw a visualization of the set" and that "Adrien Douady and John H. Hubbard . . . established many of its fundamental properties and named the set in honor of Mandelbrot."Israelgale (talk) 04:04, 21 February 2016 (UTC)
