File:1710-15 de Matteis Triumph of the Immaculate anagoria.JPG|thumb|300px|''The Triumph of the Immaculate'' by Paolo de Matteis225px|The Church of Sant'Andrea al Quirinale, designed by Gian Lorenzo BerniniThe '''Baroque''' ( or ) is often thought of as a period of artistic style that used exaggerated motion and clear, easily interpreted detail to produce drama, tension, exuberance, and grandeur in sculpture, painting, architecture, literature, dance, theater, and music. The style began around 1600 in Rome, Italy, and spread to most of Europe.The popularity and success of the Baroque style was encouraged by the Catholic Church, which had decided at the time of the Council of Trent, in response to the Protestant Reformation, that the arts should communicate religious themes in direct and emotional involvement.  The aristocracy also saw the dramatic style of Baroque architecture and art as a means of impressing visitors and expressing triumph, power and control. Baroque palaces are built around an entrance of courts, grand staircases and reception rooms of sequentially increasing opulence. However, "baroque" has resonance and application that extend beyond a simple reduction to either style or period.Helen Hills (ed), ''Rethinking the Baroque'' (Farnham (Surrey) and Burlington (Vermont): Ashgate Publishing, 2011):.EtymologyFile:German - Brooch of an African - Walters 57887 - Back.jpg|thumb|upright|''Brooch of an African'', Walters Art MuseumThe French word ''baroque'' is derived from the Portuguese word "barroco" or Spanish "barrueco"  both of which refer to a "rough or imperfect pearl", though whether it entered those languages via Latin, Arabic, or some other source is uncertain. It is also yields the Italian "barocco" and modern Spanish "barroco", German "Barock", Dutch "Barok", and so on. The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 11th edition thought the term was derived from the Spanish ''barrueco'', a large, irregularly-shaped pearl, and that it had for a time been confined to the craft of the jeweller. Others derive it from the mnemonic term "Baroco", a supposedly laboured form of syllogism in logical ''Scholastica''. The Latin root can be found in ''bis-roca''.In informal usage, the word ''baroque'' can simply mean that something is "elaborate", with many details, without reference to the Baroque styles of the 17th and 18th centuries.The word "Baroque", like most periodic or stylistic designations, was invented by later critics rather than practitioners of the arts in the 17th and early 18th centuries. It is a French transliteration of the Portuguese phrase "pérola barroca", which means  "irregular pearl", and natural pearls that deviate from the usual, regular forms so they do not have an axis of rotation are known as "baroque pearls".The term "Baroque" was initially used in a derogatory sense, to underline the excesses of its emphasis. In particular, the term was used to describe its eccentric redundancy and noisy abundance of details, which sharply contrasted the clear and sober rationality of the Renaissance. Although it was long thought that the word as a critical term was first applied to architecture, in fact it appears earlier in reference to music, in an anonymous, satirical review of the première in October 1733 of Jean-Philippe Rameau's ''Hippolyte et Aricie'', printed in the ''Mercure de France'' in May 1734. The critic implied that the novelty in this opera was "du barocque", complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was unsparing with dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device.Claude V. Palisca, "Baroque". ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).Modern taste and usageThe Swiss-born art historian, Heinrich Wölfflin (1864–1945), started the rehabilitation of the word ''Baroque'' in his ''Renaissance und Barock'' (1888); Wölfflin identified the Baroque as "movement imported into mass", an art antithetic to Renaissance art. He did not make the distinctions between Mannerism and Baroque that modern writers do, and he ignored the later phase, the academic Baroque that lasted into the 18th century.  Long despised, Baroque art and architecture became fashionable between the two World Wars, and has largely remained in critical favour.  For example, the often extreme Sicilian Baroque architecture is today recognised largely due to the work of Sir Sacheverall Sitwell, whose ''Southern Baroque Art'' of 1924 was the first book to appreciate the style, followed by the more academic work of Anthony Blunt. In painting the gradual rise in popular esteem of Caravaggio has been the best barometer of modern taste.In art history it has become common to recognise "Baroque" stylistic phases, characterized by energetic movement and display, in earlier art, so that Sir John Boardman describes the ancient sculpture ''Laocoön and His Sons'' as "one of the finest examples of the Hellenistic baroque", and a later phase of Imperial Roman sculpture is also often called "Baroque".  William Watson describes a late phase of Shang-dynasty Chinese ritual bronzes of the 11th century BC as "baroque".The term "Baroque" may still be used, usually pejoratively, describing works of art, craft, or design that are thought to have excessive ornamentation or complexity of line.DevelopmentFile:Aeneas' Flight from Troy by Federico Barocci.jpg|thumb|275px|''Aeneas Flees Burning Troy,'' Federico Barocci, 1598The Baroque originated around 1600, several decades after the Council of Trent (1545–63), by which the Roman Catholic Church answered many questions of internal reform, addressed the representational arts by demanding that paintings and sculptures in church contexts should speak to the illiterate rather than to the well-informed.  This turn toward a populist conception of the function of ecclesiastical art is seen by many art historians as driving the innovations of Caravaggio and brothers Agostino and Annibale Carracci, all of whom were working (and competing for commissions) in Rome around 1600.The appeal of Baroque style turned consciously from the witty, intellectual qualities of 16th-century Mannerist art to a visceral appeal aimed at the senses. It employed an iconography that was direct, simple, obvious, and theatrical (''illustration, right''). Baroque art drew on certain broad and heroic tendencies in Annibale Carracci and his circle, and found inspiration in other artists like Correggio and Caravaggio and Federico Barocci (''illustration, right''), nowadays sometimes termed 'proto-Baroque'.  Germinal ideas of the Baroque can also be found in the work of Michelangelo. Some general parallels in music make the expression "Baroque music" useful: there are contrasting phrase lengths, harmony and counterpoint have ousted polyphony, and orchestral color makes a stronger appearance. Even more generalized parallels perceived by some experts in philosophy, prose style and poetry, are harder to pinpoint.Though Baroque was superseded in many centers by the Rococo style, beginning in France in the late 1720s, especially for interiors, paintings and the decorative arts, the Baroque style continued to be used in architecture until the advent of Neoclassicism in the later 18th century. See the Neapolitan palace of Caserta, a Baroque palace (though in a chaste exterior) whose construction began in 1752.File:Prager Burg - Nikolauskirche Kuppel.jpg|thumb|250px|St. Nicholas Church (Malá Strana)|St. Nicholas Church in Malá Strana|Lesser Town in Prague was founded in 1703 under lead of Baroque architect Christoph Dientzenhofer.In paintings Baroque gestures are broader than Mannerist gestures: less ambiguous, less arcane and mysterious, more like the stage gestures of opera, a major Baroque art form. Baroque poses depend on ''contrapposto'' ("counterpoise"), the tension within the figures that move the planes of shoulders and hips in counterdirections. See Bernini's ''David''.The dryer, less dramatic and coloristic, chastened later stages of 18th century Baroque architectural style are often seen as a separate '''Late Baroque''' manifestation, for example in buildings by Claude Perrault. Academic characteristics in the neo-Palladian style, epitomized by William Kent, are a parallel development in Britain and the British colonies: within interiors, Kent's furniture designs are vividly influenced by the Baroque furniture of Rome and Genoa, hierarchical tectonic sculptural elements, meant never to be moved from their positions, completed the wall decoration. Baroque is a style of unity imposed upon rich, heavy detail.The Baroque was defined by Heinrich Wölfflin as the age where the oval replaced the circle as the center of composition, that centralization replaced balance, and that coloristic and "painterly" effects began to become more prominent.Art historians, often Protestant ones, have traditionally emphasized that the Baroque style evolved during a time in which the Roman Catholic Church had to react against the many revolutionary cultural movements that produced a new science and new forms of religion—Reformation.  It has been said that the monumental Baroque is a style that could give the Papacy, like  secular absolute monarchies, a formal, imposing way of expression that could restore its prestige, at the point of becoming somehow symbolic of the Counter-Reformation.Whether this is the case or not, it was successfully developed in Rome, where Baroque architecture widely renewed the central areas with perhaps the most important urbanistic revision.PeriodsThe Baroque era is sometimes divided into roughly three phases for convenience:The Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed. 2011* Early Baroque, c. 1590 – c. 1625* High Baroque, c. 1625 – c. 1660* Late Baroque, c. 1660 – c. 1725Late Baroque is also sometimes used synonymously with the succeeding Rococo movement.PaintingBaroque paintingCaravaggio, ''The Crowning with Thorns''A defining statement of what ''Baroque'' signifies in painting is provided by the series of paintings executed by Peter Paul Rubens for Marie de Medici at the Luxembourg Palace in Paris (now at the Louvre),[Peter Paul Rubens ''The Life of Marie de' Medici'']. in which a Catholic painter satisfied a Catholic patron: Baroque-era conceptions of monarchy, iconography, handling of paint, and compositions as well as the depiction of space and movement.Baroque style featured "exaggerated lighting, intense emotions, release from restraint, and even a kind of artistic sensationalism". Baroque art did not really depict the life style of the people at that time; however, "closely tied to the Counter-Reformation, this style melodramatically reaffirmed the emotional depths of the Catholic faith and glorified both church and monarchy" of their power and influence.There were highly diverse strands of Italian baroque painting, from Caravaggio to Cortona; both approaching emotive dynamism with different styles.Another frequently cited work of Baroque art is Bernini's ''Saint Theresa in Ecstasy'' for the Cornaro chapel in Saint Maria della Vittoria, which brings together architecture, sculpture, and theatre into one grand conceit.["Cornaro Chapel" at Bogelwood.com].254px|left|''Still-life'', by Josefa de Óbidos, c. 1679, Santarém, Portugal, Municipal LibraryThe later Baroque style gradually gave way to a more decorative Rococo.A rather different art developed out of northern realist traditions in 17th century Dutch Golden Age painting, which had very little religious art, and little history painting, instead playing a crucial part in developing secular genres such as still life, genre paintings of everyday scenes, and landscape painting. While the Baroque nature of Rembrandt's art is clear, the label is less often used for Vermeer and many other Dutch artists. Flemish Baroque painting shared a part in this trend, while also continuing to produce the traditional categories.In a similar way the French classical style of painting exemplified by Poussin is often classed as Baroque, and does share many qualities of the Italian painting of the same period, although the poise and restraint derived from following classical ideas typically give it a very different overall mood.SculptureBaroque sculptureFile:Pierre Le Gros (II) - The Death of St Stanislas Kostka - WGA12562.jpg|thumb|left|''Stanislaus Kostka on his deathbed'' by Pierre Le Gros the YoungerIn Baroque sculpture, groups of figures assumed new importance and there was a dynamic movement and energy of human forms—they spiraled around an empty central vortex, or reached outwards into the surrounding space. For the first time, Baroque sculpture often had multiple ideal viewing angles. The characteristic Baroque sculpture added extra-sculptural elements, for example, concealed lighting, or water fountains. Aleijadinho in Brazil was also one of the great names of baroque sculpture, and his master work is the set of statues of the ''Santuário de Bom Jesus de Matosinhos'' in Congonhas. The soapstone sculptures of old testament prophets around the terrace are considered amongst his finest work.The architecture, sculpture and fountains of Bernini (1598–1680) give highly charged characteristics of Baroque style. Bernini was undoubtedly the most important sculptor of the Baroque period. He approached Michelangelo in his omnicompetence:  Bernini sculpted, worked as an architect, painted, wrote plays, and staged spectacles. In the late 20th century Bernini was most valued for his sculpture, both for his virtuosity in carving marble and his ability to create figures that combine the physical and the spiritual. He was also a fine sculptor of bust portraits in high demand among the powerful.Bernini's Cornaro chapelA good example of Bernini's Baroque work is his ''St. Theresa in Ecstasy'' (1645–52), created for the Cornaro Chapel of the church of Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome. Bernini designed the entire chapel, a subsidiary space along the side of the church, for the Cornaro family.File:Estasi di Santa Teresa.jpg|thumb|Bernini's ''Ecstasy of St. Teresa''Saint Theresa, the focal point of the chapel, is a soft white marble statue surrounded by a polychromatic marble architectural framing. This structure conceals a window which lights the statue from above. Figure-groups of the Cornaro family sculpted in shallow relief inhabit opera boxes on the two side walls of the chapel. The setting places the viewer as a spectator in front of the statue with the Cornaro family leaning out of their box seats and craning forward to see the mystical ecstasy of the saint.St. Teresa of Ávila|Theresa is highly idealized and in an imaginary setting. She was a popular saint of the Catholic Reformation.  She wrote of her mystical experiences for an audience of the nuns of her Carmelite Order;  these writings had become popular reading among lay people interested in spirituality. In her writings, she described the love of God as piercing her heart like a burning arrow. Bernini materializes this by placing St. Theresa on a butt while a Cupid figure holds a golden arrow made of metal and smiles down at her. The angelic figure is not preparing to plunge the arrow into her heart—rather, he has withdrawn it. St. Theresa's face reflects not the anticipation of ecstasy, but her current fulfillment.This work is widely considered a masterpiece of the Baroque, although the mix of religious and erotic imagery (faithful to St Teresa's own written account) may raise modern eyebrows.  However, Bernini was a devout Catholic and was not attempting to satirize the experience of a chaste nun. Rather, he aimed to portray religious experience as an intensely physical one. Theresa described her bodily reaction to spiritual enlightenment in a language of ecstasy used by many mystics, and Bernini's depiction is earnest.The Cornaro family promotes itself discreetly in this chapel;  they are represented visually, but are placed on the sides of the chapel, witnessing the event from balconies. As in an opera house, the Cornaro have a privileged position in respect to the viewer, in their private reserve, closer to the saint; the viewer, however, has a better view from the front. They attach their name to the chapel, but St. Theresa is the focus. It is a private chapel in the sense that no one could say mass on the altar beneath the statue (in 17th century and probably through the 19th) without permission from the family, but the only thing that divides the viewer from the image is the altar rail. The spectacle functions both as a demonstration of mysticism and as a piece of family pride.ArchitectureFile:Hauptaltar der St. John’s Co-Cathedral.JPG|thumb|The altar of the pompous St. John's Co-Cathedral, MaltaBaroque architectureIn Baroque architecture, new emphasis was placed on bold massing, colonnades, domes, light-and-shade (''chiaroscuro''), 'painterly' color effects, and the bold play of volume and void. In interiors, Baroque movement around and through a void informed monumental staircases that had no parallel in previous architecture. The other Baroque innovation in worldly interiors was the state apartment, a sequence of increasingly rich interiors that culminated in a presence chamber or throne room or a state bedroom. The sequence of monumental stairs followed by a state apartment was copied in smaller scale everywhere in aristocratic dwellings of any pretensions.Baroque architecture was taken up with enthusiasm in central Germany (see, e.g., Ludwigsburg Palace and Zwinger, Dresden), Austria and Russia (see, e.g., Peterhof). In England the culmination of Baroque architecture was embodied in work by Sir Christopher Wren, Sir John Vanbrugh and Nicholas Hawksmoor, from ca. 1660 to ca. 1725. Many examples of Baroque architecture and town planning are found in other European towns, and in Latin America. Town planning of this period featured radiating avenues intersecting in squares, which took cues from Baroque garden plans. In Sicily, Baroque developed new shapes and themes as in Noto, Ragusa and Acireale "Basilica di San Sebastiano".Another example of Baroque architecture is the Cathedral of Morelia, Michoacán in Mexico. Built in the 17th century by Vincenzo Barrochio, it is one of the many Baroque cathedrals in Mexico. Baroque churches are also seen in the Philippines, which were built during the Spanish period.Francis Ching described Baroque architecture as "a style of architecture originating in Italy in the early 17th century and variously prevalent in Europe and the New World for a century and a half, characterized by free and sculptural use of the classical orders and ornament, dynamic opposition and interpenetration of spaces, and the dramatic combined effects of architecture, sculpture, painting, and the decorative arts."Francis DK Ching, ''A Visual Dictionary of Architecture'', p.133File:Hermitage night.jpg|Winter PalaceFile:Trevi Fountain, Rome, Italy 2 - May 2007.jpg|Trevi Fountain in RomeFile:Elewacja wschodnia.jpg|Wilanów Palace in WarsawFile:Santa Maria della Vittoria - 4.jpg|Interior of the Cornaro Chapel, Santa Maria della Vittoria church, Rome  including the Cornaro portraits, but omitting the lower parts of the chapel.Theatre18th-century painting of the Royal Theatre of TurinIn theatre, the elaborate conceits, multiplicity of plot turns and a variety of situations characteristic of Mannerism, in Shakespeare's tragedies for instance, were superseded by opera, which drew together all the arts into a unified whole.Theatre evolved in the Baroque era and became a multimedia experience, starting with the actual architectural space. In fact, much of the technology used in current Broadway or commercial plays was invented and developed during this era. The stage could change from a romantic garden to the interior of a palace in a matter of seconds. The entire space became a framed selected area that only allows the users to see a specific action, hiding all the machinery and technology – mostly ropes and pulleys.This technology affected the content of the narrated or performed pieces, practicing at its best the Deus ex Machina solution. Gods were finally able to come down – literally – from the heavens and rescue the hero in the most extreme and dangerous, even absurd situations.The term Theatrum Mundi – the world is a stage – was also created. The social and political realm in the real world is manipulated in exactly the same way the actor and the machines are presenting/limiting what is being presented on stage, hiding selectively all the machinery that makes the actions happen.The films ''Vatel'' and ''Farinelli'' give a good idea of the style of productions of the Baroque period. The American musician William Christie and Les Arts Florissants have performed extensive research on all the French Baroque Opera, performing pieces from Charpentier and Lully, among others that are extremely faithful to the original 17th-century creations.EnglandThe influence of the Renaissance was also very late in England, and Baroque theatre is only partly a useful concept here, for example in discussing Restoration comedy. There was an 18-year break when the London theatres were closed during the English Civil War and English Commonwealth until the Restoration of Charles II in 1660.GermanyGerman theatre in the 17th century lacked major contributions. The best known playwright was Andreas Cryphius, who used the Jesuit model of the Dutch Joost van den Vondel and Cornielle. There was also Johannes Velten who combined the traditions of the English comedians and the commedia del'arte  with the classic theater of Corneille and Moliere. His touring company was perhaps the most significant and important of the 17th century.SpainThe Baroque had a Catholic and conservative character in Spain, following an Italian literary models during the Renaissance.González Mas , Ezequiel (1980). Historia de la literatura española: (Siglo XVII). Barroco, Volumen 3. La Editorial, UPR, pp.1–2 The Hispanic Baroque theater aimed for a public content with an ideal reality that manifested fundamental three sentiments: Catholic religion, monarchist and national pride and honor originating from the chivalric, knightly world.González Mas , Ezequiel (1980). Historia de la literatura española: (Siglo XVII). Barroco, Volumen 3. La Editorial, UPR, p. 8.Two periods are known in the Barocan Spanish theater. The separation between them was emphasized in 1630; the first period consists of a principle representant who is Lope de Vega, and also Tirso de Molina, Gaspar de Aguilar, Guillén de Castro, Antonio Mira de Amescua, Luis Vélez de Guevara, Juan Ruiz de Alarcón, Diego Jiménez de Enciso, Luis Belmonte Bermúdez, Felipe Godínez, Luis Quiñones de Benavente or Juan Pérez de Montalbán; and in the second period Calderón de la Barca and the other play writers Antonio Hurtado de Mendoza, Álvaro Cubillo de Aragón, Jerónimo de Cáncer y Velasco, Francisco de Rojas Zorrilla, Juan de Matos Fragoso, Antonio Coello y Ochoa, Agustín Moreto or Francisco de Bances Candamo.González Mas , Ezequiel (1980). Historia de la literatura española: (Siglo XVII). Barroco, Volumen 3. La Editorial, UPR, p. 13 It is possible to speak about a loosely classification, because each author had his own way and could occasionally adhere himself to the formula established by Lope. Perhaps, the "manner" of Lope was more liberal and structured than Calderon's.González Mas , Ezequiel (1980). Historia de la literatura española: (Siglo XVII). Barroco, Volumen 3. La Editorial, UPR, p. 91Felix Lope de Vega y Carpio introduced through his ''Arte nuevo de hacer comedias en este tiempo'' (1609) the ''new comedy''. He established a new dramatic formula that broke the three Aristotle unities of the Italian school of poetry (action, time and place) and a forth unity of Aristotle which is about style, mixing of tragic and comic elements showing different types of verses and stanzas upon what is represented.Lope de Vega, 2010, Comedias: El Remedio en la Desdicha. El Mejor Alcalde El Rey, pp.446–447 Although Lope has a great knowledge of the plastic arts, he did not use it during the major part of his career nor in theater or scenography. The Lope's comedy granted a second role to the visual aspects of the theatrical representation.Amadei-Pulice, 1990, María Alicia (1990). Calderón y el barroco: exaltación y engaño de los sentidos. John Benjamins Publishing Company, p. 6Tirso de Molina along with Lope de Vega and Caledron were of the most important play writers in Spain during the golden era. Their works, known for its subtle intelligence and profound comprehension of a person's humanity, could be considered a bridge between primitive Lope's comedy and a more elaborate Calderon's comedy. Although part of the critics argued their writings showing that Tirso de Molina was known for two flawless works, The convicted suspicions, The Trickster of Seville, a principal sources of the Don Juan myth.Wilson, Edward M.; Moir, Duncan (1992). Historia de la literatura española: Siglo De Oro: Teatro (1492–1700). Editorial Ariel, pp.155–158Upon his arrival to Madrid, Cosme Lotti brought to the Spanish court the most advanced theatrical techniques of Europe. His techniques and mechanic knowledge were applied in palace exhibitions called "Fiestas" and in lavish exhibitions of rivers or artificial fountains called "Naumaquias". He was in charge of styling the Gardens of Buen Retiro, of Zarzuela and of Aranjuez and the construction of the theatrical building of Coliseo del Buen Retiro.Amadei-Pulice, 1990, María Alicia (1990). Calderón y el barroco: exaltación y engaño de los sentidos. John Benjamins Publishing Company, pp.26–27 Lope's formulas begins with a verse that it unbefitting of the palace theater foundation and the birth of new concepts that begun the careers of some play writers like Pedro Calderon de la Barca. Marking the principal innovations of the New Lopesian Comedy, Calderon's style marked many differences, with a great deal of constructive care and attention to his internal structure. Calderon's work is in formal perfection and a very lyric and symbolic language. Liberty, vitality and openness of Lope gave a step to Calderon's intellectual reflection and formal precision. In his comedy it reflected his ideological and doctrine intentions in above the passion and the action, the work of Auto Sacramentales achieved high ranks.Molina Jiménez,  María Belén (2008). El teatro musical de Calderón de la Barca: Análisis textual. EDITUM, p. 56The genre of Comedia is political, multi-artistic and in a sense hybrid. The poetic text interweaved with Medias and resources originating from architecture, music and painting freeing the deception that is in the Lopesian comedy was made up from the lack of scenery and engaging the dialogue of action.Amadei-Pulice, 1990, María Alicia (1990).

A fairly clear, shared element is a love of ornamentation, and it is perhaps significant that the role of ornament was greatly diminished in both music and architecture as the Baroque gave way to the Classical period.The application of the term "Baroque" to music is a relatively recent development, although it has recently been pointed out that the first use of the word "baroque"in criticism of any of the arts related to music, in an anonymous, satirical review of the première in October 1733 of Rameau's ''Hippolyte et Aricie,'' printed in the ''Mercure de France'' in May 1734. The critic implied that the novelty in this opera was "du barocque," complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was filled with unremitting dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device.2001However this was an isolated reference, and consistent use was only begun in 1919, by Curt Sachs, and it was not until 1940 that it was first used in English (in an article published by Manfred Bukofzer).2001Many musical forms were born in that era, like the concerto and sinfonia. Forms such as the sonata, cantata and oratorio flourished. Also, opera was born out of the experimentation of the Florentine Camerata, the creators of monody, who attempted to recreate the theatrical arts of the Ancient Greeks. An important technique used in baroque music was the use of ground bass, a repeated bass line. ''Dido's Lament'' by Henry Purcell is a famous example of this technique.Composers and examples* Giovanni Gabrieli (c. 1554/1557–1612) ''Sonata pian' e forte'' (1597), ''In Ecclesiis'' (from ''Symphoniae sacrae'' book 2, 1615)* Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643), ''L'Orfeo, favola in musica'' (1610)* Heinrich Schütz (1585–1672), ''Musikalische Exequien'' (1629, 1647, 1650)* Francesco Cavalli (1602–1676), ''L'Egisto'' (1643), ''Ercole amante'' (1662), ''Scipione affricano'' (1664)* Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632–1687), ''Armide'' (1686)* Marc-Antoine Charpentier (1643–1704), ''Te Deum'' (1688–1698)* Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber (1644–1704), ''Mystery Sonatas'' (1681)* John Blow (1649–1708), ''Venus and Adonis'' (1680–1687)* Johann Pachelbel (1653–1706), ''Canon in D'' (1680)* Arcangelo Corelli (1653–1713), 12 concerti grossi, Op. 6 (1714)* Marin Marais (1656–1728), ''Sonnerie de Ste-Geneviève du Mont-de-Paris'' (1723)* Henry Purcell (1659–1695), ''Dido and Aeneas'' (1688)* Alessandro Scarlatti (1660–1725), ''L'honestà negli amori'' (1680), ''Il Pompeo'' (1683), ''Mitridate Eupatore'' (1707)* François Couperin (1668–1733), ''Les barricades mystérieuses'' (1717)* Tomaso Albinoni (1671–1751), ''Didone abbandonata'' (1724)* Antonio Vivaldi (1678–1741), ''The Four Seasons'' (1723)* Jan Dismas Zelenka (1679–1745), ''Il Serpente di Bronzo'' (1730), ''Missa Sanctissimae Trinitatis'' (1736)* Georg Philipp Telemann (1681–1767), ''Der Tag des Gerichts'' (1762)* Johann David Heinichen (1683–1729)* Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683–1764), ''Dardanus'' (1739)* George Frideric Handel (1685–1759), ''Water Music'' (1717), ''Messiah'' (1741)* Domenico Scarlatti (1685–1757), Sonatas for harpsichord* Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750), Toccata and Fugue in D minor (1703–1707), ''Brandenburg Concertos'' (1721), ''St Matthew Passion'' (1727)* Nicola Porpora (1686–1768), ''Semiramide riconosciuta'' (1729)* Giovanni Battista Pergolesi (1710–1736), ''Stabat Mater'' (1736)See also* Baroque architecture* Brazilian Baroque* Czech Baroque* Dutch Baroque* English Baroque* French Baroque* Italian Baroque* Italian Baroque (Sicily)* Mexican Baroque* Neo-Baroque* Peruvian and Bolivian Baroque* Polish Baroque* Portuguese Baroque* Russian Baroque (Moscow)* Russian Baroque (Saint Petersburg)* Russian Baroque (Siberia)* Spanish Baroque* Ukrainian BaroqueNotes30emReferences30em* Andersen, Liselotte. 1969.
