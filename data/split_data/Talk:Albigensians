We now have entries at Cathar and Cathars (honest.  separate entries) and here.  --MichaelTinklerSuggested additionI suggest that someone add on this page a link to the following from the Catholic Encyclopedia:AlbigensesPerhaps it could be put under a heading marked "External links" or something similar.I'd do it myself, but I'm too afraid that I'd botch the job and earn the scorn of the wiki-wise.Suggested MergeIt seems to me that Albigenses and Albigensians are the same group, and should share the same article. Incidentally, I would not mind seeing a merge of both into Cathar, but there were probably reasons for the creation of an extra article. Kusma (talk) 20:27, 1 December 2005 (UTC)I don't believe a merge with the article on the Cathars would be the best option.  It appears to me that the Cathar article is about a relgious sect while the Albigensian article concerns a geographic area. Luneraako 22:07, 3 January 2006 (UTC): But it doesn't, really. As the article itself says, the group under discussion centred on Toulouse if anywhere, and to some extent merged with the Waldensians who have a quite different geographical origin. I would say the first paragraph of the article should be retained, since it explains the use of the term. The rest is duplicated under Cathar, or ought to be, and would be better deleted.

This is just a preliminary article until a more indepth article can be constructed.CDW-----------------------------------------------------------------Can someone tell me if they purposefully deleted my additions to the Albigensian article or was it some automatic glitch?If purposely please leave comments as to why?
