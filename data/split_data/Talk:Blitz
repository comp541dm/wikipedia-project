UntitledBlitz doesn't mean "very fast" in German. It simply means "flash" or "lightning". Probably the misunderstanding stems from the word "blitzschnell" meaning "fast as lightning".The Blitz++ is under HEY, HOE YO DOING...the GNU General Public License and Artistic licence as it is written on the [Legal page] and can be freely copied. RedAndr 20:00, 11 May 2007 (UTC):I disagree with your assessment. While the software is released under the GPL, there is no indication of a documentation release under GFDL. I don't think the content posted on sourceforge is reputed not having any copyright (talking about everything that is not a program, of course). -- lucasbfr User talk:Lucasbfr|talk;/font; 20:15, 11 May 2007 (UTC):::What about README file, which is distributed inside the program package? Can it be considered as a part of the program? May I cite it? RedAndr 21:48, 11 May 2007 (UTC)::::Errrrr, good question. There might also be an issue on the notability of the program, by the way. Was it cited by independent reliable sources? If it was, don't forget to cite them in the article or it might be speedy deleted as not asserting the importance of the subject. -- lucasbfr User talk:Lucasbfr|talk;/font; 22:09, 11 May 2007 (UTC):::::I gather from this page that the GPL is not compatible with the GFDL, so neither the readme nor the documentation on the website can be posted to Wikipedia without permission. --Butseriouslyfolks 23:56, 11 May 2007 (UTC)::::::From README: "''Licensing information is at Summary: '''you can do anything except sell this library in source form'''.  Blitz is licensed under both the GPL (see COPYING) and a less restrictive (non-viral) "artistic license" (see LICENSE).''" Concerning notability, it's not a problem, since the library is very widely used, there are a lot of independent sources. RedAndr 01:29, 12 May 2007 (UTC):::::::That is insufficient for use at Wikipedia.  Neither the GPL nor the "artistic license" equal GFDL. --Butseriouslyfolks 06:57, 12 May 2007 (UTC)::::::::I have received permission from , the creator of the library, to use texts from the Blitz++ site in Wikipedia. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by RedAndr (talk • Special:Contributions/RedAndr|contribs) 13:18, 15 May 2007 (UTC).;;;Back to the fist point: "blitz" means "lightning at the heaven within a thunderstorm" or "the flash at or beside a photocamera". And it does not mean "fast".There is one word - "blitzschnell" - meaning fast like a (thunderstorm-)flash.The word for "fast" in german is "schnell". And it is used like "fast" in englisch. Here is a example and the transcription word by word:"Das ist zu schnell" = "This is to fast"   or  "Das Auto ist schnell" = "The car is fast" . It is impossible to use the word "blitz" as a word for "fast"!So I tried to edit the "intro". Special:Contributions/95.157.17.217|95.157.17.217 (talk) 01:29, 18 February 2010 (UTC)
