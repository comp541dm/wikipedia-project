Because Iowa is the first caucus state and Ames is a college town, it is the site of many political appearances, debates and events, especially during election years.From 1979 through 2011, Ames was the location of the Ames Straw Poll, which was held every August prior to a presidential election year in which the Republican presidential nomination was undecided (meaning there was no Republican president running for re-election—as in 2011, 2007, 1999, 1995, 1987, and 1979). The poll would gauge support for the various Republican candidates amongst attendees of a fundraising dinner benefiting the Iowa Republican Party. The straw poll was frequently seen by national media and party insiders as a first test of organizational strength in Iowa. In 2015, the straw poll was to be moved to nearby Boone before the Iowa Republican Party eventually decided to cancel it altogether.See alsoIowa* Ames process* North Grand Mall* Reiman GardensReferences30emExternal linksAmes, IowaAmes*[Official Ames City Website]*[The Main Street Cultural District]* Detailed Statistical Data and more about Ames;br;;
