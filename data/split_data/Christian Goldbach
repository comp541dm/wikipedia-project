'''Christian Goldbach''' (March 18, 1690 ;ndash; November 20, 1764) was a Prussian mathematician who also studied law. He is remembered today for Goldbach's conjecture.BiographyBorn in the Duchy of Prussia's capital Königsberg, part of Brandenburg-Prussia, Goldbach was the son of a pastor. He studied at the University of Königsberg|Royal Albertus University.After finishing his studies he went on long educational voyages from 1710 to 1724 through Europe, visiting other German states, England, Holland, Italy, and France, meeting with many famous mathematicians, such as Gottfried Leibniz, Leonhard Euler, and Nicholas I Bernoulli. Back in Königsberg he got acquainted with Georg Bernhard Bilfinger and Jakob Hermann.He went on to work at the newly opened St Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1725, as a professor of mathematics and historian of the academy. In 1728, when Peter II became Tsar of Russia, Goldbach became his tutor.ebIn 1742 he entered the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Christian Goldbach was multilingual – he wrote a diary which was written in German and Latin, his letters were written in German, Latin, French, and Italian and for official documents he used Russian, German and Latin.Adolf Juskevic, Judith Kopelevic: Christian Goldbach 1690-1764 (Vita Mathematica), Birkhäuser Publishing House, 1994, ISBN 3764326786, pg.

He also studied and proved some theorems on perfect powers, such as the Goldbach–Euler theorem, and made several notable contributions to analysis."element"He also proved a result concerning Fermat numbers that is called Goldbach's theorem.Works* (1729) ''De transformatione serierum''* (1732) ''De terminis generalibus serierum''ReferencesExternal links*Category:University of Königsberg alumniCategory:People from Königsberg
