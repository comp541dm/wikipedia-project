Scotland should be on thisI understand the Kingdom of Great Britain did not exist until 1707, but the army fighting in Europe represented the Queen. Their was never an "English" army, it was the Queen's army. And the Monarch represented England, Ireland AND Scotland. Their were English, Irish and Scottish regiments at Blenheim, so it is very simplistic to put only England in the list of Belligerants.Vienna - Capital of the Holy Roman EmpireThe page reads "Vienna – the capital of the Holy Roman Empire".Vienna was the capital of the Habsburgs, who were Holy Roman Emperors.  However, I believe the capital of the Holy Roman Empire was Frankfurt-am-Main.Maproom 15:09, 17 May 2007 (UTC):The capital of the Holy Roman Empire under the Habsburgs was Vienna. The seat of the Holy Roman Emperor was Vienna. 18:26, 17 May 2007 (UTC)Do you have evidence for this?

There is some inconsistency in the article.:Until the Acts of Union in 1707, three years after the battle, England and Scotland were separate kingdoms under a common monarch, and "Britain" was just a geographical term for the islands, not a nationality (like the term "Peninsular" or "Iberian" for Portugal and Spain).

But the best sources I can find show that Blenheim (or Blindheim) and Höchstadt were then in the Principality of Palatinate-Neuburg, whose territories became part of Bavaria in 1808. Maproom (talk) 17:48, 19 December 2007 (UTC)Flag IconThe flag for England, or more properly, Great Britain or United Kingdom is this flag: Kingdom of Great Britain which shows the union of England and Scotland which occured when James VI of Scotland  became also James I of England in 1606. The red cross is a flag that precedes this see: This 'union' flag combines the cross of St George with that of St. Andrew. The red cross refers only to England separately from Scotland, it is not the flag of Great Britain (England ; Scotland) after 1606. see: Tttom1 (talk) 06:15, 29 December 2007 (UTC):Great Britain only came into existence with the 1707 Act of Union, while previously England and Scotland remained separate countries with the same monarch, much as the various Commonwealth contries are today. MartinMcCann (talk) 13:23, 29 December 2007 (UTC)::So after 1707 its this flag: Kingdom of Great Britain and before 1707 it is this flag: England. OK.

MartinMcCann (talk) 18:19, 29 December 2007 (UTC)removal of "Holy Roman Empire"I am glad to see that Centurion Z1 has replaced references to the Holy Roman Empire, by references to the Habsburg Monarchy. I have done the same for what Vienna was capital of, in the first paragraph. Note that Bavaria was part of the Holy Roman Empire, but was fighting against the Habsburgs.

The risings in Hungary were never a problem for the Empire but for the House of Habsburg. The Hungarians wanted to get rid of the Habsburg rulers, not of any empire because they were not part of any until 1806, when the "old Empire" was disbanded by Napoleon and the Emperor called himself Emperor of Austira.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/78.49.3.120|78.49.3.120 (talk) 01:14, 13 August 2008 (UTC);;; ;;Wiki problemThere seems to be something wrong with the Wiki.

Also to state that "in some contries the battle is referred to as the second battle of höchstädt" is a little confusing, considering the fact that three out of four major participants call it höchstädt... MfG koookeee"general de Coignies"Under this sobriquet are we to recognize Lieutenant-General Robert Jean Antoine de Franquetot de Coigny (1652-1704)? The pronunciation is identical. His estate at Coigny was raised to a ''comté'' by Louis XIV as a mark of his father's service. The comte de Coigny entered the Mousquetaires in 1667 and had a distinguished military career up to his death at Koenigsmacker, Alsace, in August 1704. In 1680 he had been appointed Governor of Caen; he was Lieutenant-General of Louis XIV's armies in 1693, and Director-General of Cavalry in 1694. The .

There is a lot of overt praise in certain sections of how masterful an achievement this victory was and how cunning Malborough's tactics were. Don't get me wrong, I definitely agree that this is a very famous battle and victory. However this is supposed to be non-biased. I would argue reading tbe facts and simply scanning the infobox would lead most people to draw similar conclusions as certain biased sections of this article, without having to break Wikipedia's style rules.
