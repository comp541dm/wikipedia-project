European bisonThe '''aurochs''' ( or ; pl. '''aurochs''', or rarely '''aurochsen''', '''aurochses'''), also '''urus''', '''ure''' (''Bos primigenius''), is an extinct type of large wild cattle that inhabited Europe, Asia and North Africa. It is the ancestor of domestic cattle. The species survived in Europe until the last recorded aurochs died in the Jaktorów Forest, Poland in 1627.During the Neolithic Revolution, which occurred during the early Holocene, there were at least two aurochs domestication events: one related to the Indian subspecies, leading to zebu cattle; the other one related to the Eurasian subspecies, leading to taurine cattle. Other species of wild bovines were also domesticated, namely the wild water buffalo, gaur, and banteng. In modern cattle, numerous breeds share characteristics of the aurochs, such as a dark colour in the bulls with a light eel stripe along the back (the cows being lighter), or a typical aurochs-like horn shape.TaxonomyImage:Tur ZHerberstein pol XVIw small.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration from Sigismund von Herberstein's book published in 1556 captioned : "I am 'urus', ''tur'' in Polish, ''aurox'' in German (dunces call me bison) lit. ''(the) ignorant (ones) had given me the name (of) Bison''"; Latin original: ''Urus sum, polonis Tur, germanis Aurox: ignari Bisontis nomen dederant''The aurochs was variously classified as ''Bos primigenius'', ''Bos taurus'', or, in old sources, ''Bos urus''. However, in 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature "conserved the usage of 17 specific names based on wild species, which are pre-dated by or contemporary with those based on domestic forms",icznconfirming ''Bos primigenius'' for the aurochs.  Taxonomists who consider domesticated cattle a subspecies of the wild aurochs should use ''B. primigenius taurus''; those who consider domesticated cattle to be a separate species may use the name ''B. taurus'', which the Commission has kept available for that purpose.EtymologyThe words ''aurochs'', ''urus'', and ''wisent''have all been used synonymously in English.ahd4mwuHowever, the extinct aurochs/urus is a completely separate species from the still-extant wisent, also known as European bison. The two were often confused, and some 16th-century illustrations of aurochs and wisents have hybrid features.anhThe word ''urus'' (; plural ''uri'')"AHD4, headword urus"mwu2is a Latin word, but was borrowed into Latin from Germanic (cf. Old English/Old High German ''ūr'', Old Norse ''úr'')."AHD4, headword urus"In German, OHG ''ūr'' was compounded with ''ohso'' "ox", giving ''ūrohso'', which became early modern ''Aurochs''. The modern form is ''Auerochse''."vVuure05"The word ''aurochs'' was borrowed from early modern German, replacing archaic ''urochs'', also from an earlier form of German. The word is invariable in number in English, though sometimes back-formed singular ''auroch'' and innovated plural ''aurochses'' occur."MWU, headword aurochs"The use in English of the plural form ''aurochsen'' is nonstandard, but mentioned in ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language''.crystalIt is directly parallel to the German plural ''Ochsen'' (singular ''Ochse'') and recreates by analogy the same distinction as English ''ox'' (singular) and ''oxen'' (plural).EvolutionAurochs bull at the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen from 7400 BCFile:Aurochs reconstruction.jpg|thumb|Life restoration of an aurochs bull found in Braunschweig, GermanyFile:Indian Aurochs B p namadicus 3.jpg|thumb|Speculative life restoration of the enigmatic Indian aurochs (''B. p. namadicus'')During the Pliocene, the colder climate caused an extension of open grassland, which led to the evolution of large grazers, such as wild bovines."vVuure05"''Bos acutifrons'' is an extinct species of cattle that has been suggested as an ancestor for the aurochs."vVuure05"The oldest aurochs remains have been dated to about 2 million years ago, in India. The Indian subspecies was the first to appear."vVuure05"During the Pleistocene, the species migrated west into the Middle East (western Asia) as well as to the east. They reached Europe about 270,000 years ago."vVuure05"The South Asian domestic cattle, or zebu, descended from Indian aurochs at the edge of the Thar Desert; the zebu is resistant to drought. Domestic yak, gayal and Javan cattle do not descend from aurochs.The first complete mitochondrial genome (16,338 base pairs) DNA sequence analysis of "Bos primigenius" from an archaeologically verified and exceptionally well preserved aurochs bone sample was published in 2010."Edwards 2010"Three wild subspecies of aurochs are recognized. Only the Eurasian subspecies survived until recent times.* The Eurasian aurochs (''Bos primigenius primigenius'') once ranged across the steppes and taigas of Europe, Siberia, and Central Asia. It is noted as part of the Pleistocene megafauna, and declined in numbers along with other megafauna species by the end of Pleistocene. The Eurasian aurochs were domesticated into modern taurine cattle breeds around the 6th millennium BC in the Middle East, and possibly also at about the same time in the Far East. Aurochs were still widespread in Europe during the time of the Roman Empire, when they were widely popular as a battle beast in Roman arenas. Excessive hunting began and continued until the species was nearly extinct. By the 13th century, aurochs existed only in small numbers in Eastern Europe, and the hunting of aurochs became a privilege of nobles, and later royal households. The aurochs were not saved from extinction, and the last recorded live aurochs, a female, died in 1627 in the Jaktorów Forest, Poland from natural causes. Aurochs were found to have lived on the island of Sicily, having migrated via a land bridge from Italy. After the disappearance of the land bridge, Sicilian aurochs evolved to be 20% smaller than their mainland relatives (Island dwarfism)."vVuure05"* The Indian aurochs (''Bos primigenius namadicus'') once inhabited India. It was the first subspecies of the aurochs to appear, at 2 million years ago, and from about 9,000 years ago (BP), it was domesticated as the zebu cattle.napFossil remains indicate there were wild Indian aurochs besides domesticated zebu cattle in Gujarat and the Ganges area until about 4,000-5,000 years ago. Remains from wild aurochs, 4,400 years old, are clearly identified from Karnataka in south India.mess* The North African aurochs (''Bos primigenius africanus'') once lived in the woodland and shrubland of North Africa."IUCN"It descended from aurochs populations migrating from the Middle East. The North African aurochs was morphologically very similar to the Eurasian subspecies, so that this taxon may exist only in a biogeographic sense."vVuure05"However, there is evidence that it was genetically distinct from the Eurasian subspecies.nosourceDepictions indicate that North African aurochs may have had a light saddle marking on its back."Frisch"This subspecies may have been extinct prior to the Middle Ages."vVuure05"DescriptionFile:Aurochs skull fromberlin.jpg|thumb|right|Holocene aurochs bull skull in BerlinThe appearance of the aurochs has been reconstructed from skeletal material, historical descriptions and contemporaneous depictions, such as cave paintings, engravings or Sigismund von Herberstein’s illustration. The work by Charles Hamilton Smith is a copy of a painting owned by a merchant in Augsburg, which may date to the 16th century. Scholars have proposed that Smith's illustration was based on a cattle/aurochs hybrid, or an aurochs-like breed.anh2The aurochs was depicted in prehistoric cave paintings and described in Julius Caesar's ''The Gallic War, Book 6, Ch. 28''.SizeThe aurochs was one of the largest herbivores in postglacial Europe, comparable to the wisent, the European bison. The size of an aurochs appears to have varied by region: in Europe, northern populations were bigger on average than those from the south. For example, during the Holocene, aurochs from Denmark and Germany had an average height at the shoulders of  in bulls and  in cows, while aurochs populations in Hungary had bulls reaching .kyselThe body mass of aurochs appears to have shown some variability. Some individuals were comparable in weight to the wisent and the banteng, reaching around , whereas those from the late-middle Pleistocene are estimated to have weighed up to , as much as the largest gaur (the largest extant bovid)."vVuure05"The sexual dimorphism between bull and cow was strongly expressed, with the cows being significantly shorter than bulls on average.Restoration of the aurochs based on a bull skeleton from Lund and a cow skeleton from Cambridge, with chart of characteristic external features of the aurochsHornsBecause of the massive horns, the frontal bones of aurochs were elongated and broad. The horns of the aurochs were characteristic in size, curvature and orientation. They were curved in three directions: upwards and outwards at the base, then swinging forwards and inwards, then inwards and upwards. Aurochs horns could reach  in length and between  in diameter."Frisch"The horns of bulls were larger, with the curvature more strongly expressed than in cows. The horns grew from the skull at a 60° angle to the muzzle, facing forwards."vVuure05"Body shapeThe proportions and body shape of the aurochs were strikingly different from many modern cattle breeds."vVuure05"For example, the legs were considerably longer and more slender, resulting in a shoulder height that nearly equalled the trunk length. The skull, carrying the large horns, was substantially larger and more elongated than in most cattle breeds. As in other wild bovines, the body shape of the aurochs was athletic and, especially in bulls, showed a strongly expressed neck and shoulder musculature. Therefore, the forehand was larger than the rear, similar to the wisent but unlike many domestic cattle."vVuure05"Even in carrying cows, the udder was small and hardly visible from the side; this feature is equal to that of other wild bovines."vVuure05"File:Lascaux painting.jpg|thumb|Aurochs in a cave painting in Lascaux, FranceCoat colourCoat colourThe coat colour of the aurochs can be reconstructed by using historical and contemporary depictions. In his letter to Conrad Gesner (1602), Anton Schneeberger describes the aurochs, a description that agrees with cave paintings in Lascaux and Chauvet. Calves were born a chestnut colour.  Young bulls changed their coat colour at a few months' old to a very deep brown or black, with a white eel stripe running down the spine. Cows retained the reddish-brown colour. Both sexes had a light-coloured muzzle."vVuure05"Some North African engravings show aurochs with a light-coloured "saddle" on the back,"Frisch"but otherwise there is no evidence of variation in coat colour throughout its range. A passage from Mucante (1596), describing the “wild ox” as gray, but is ambiguous and may refer to the wisent. Egyptian grave paintings show cattle with a reddish-brown coat colour in both sexes, with a light saddle, but the horn shape of these suggest that they may depict domestic cattle."vVuure05"Remains of aurochs hair were not known until the early 1980s.doiColour of forelocksSome primitive cattle breeds display similar coat colours to the aurochs, including the black colour in bulls with a light eel stripe, a pale mouth, and similar sexual dimorphism in colour. A feature often attributed to the aurochs is blond forehead hairs. Historical descriptions tell that the aurochs had long and curly forehead hair, but none mentions a certain colour for it. Cis van Vuure (2005) says that, although the colour is present in a variety of primitive cattle breeds, it is probably a discolouration that appeared after domestication. The gene responsible for this feature has not yet been identified."vVuure05"Zebu breeds show lightly coloured inner sides of the legs and belly, caused by the so-called zebu-tipping gene. It has not been tested if this gene is present in remains of the wild form of the zebu, the Indian aurochs."vVuure05"Behaviour and ecologyImage:Long horned european wild ox.jpg|thumb|A painting by Heinrich Harder showing an aurochs fighting off a Eurasian wolf packLike many bovids, aurochs formed herds for at least one part of the year. These probably did not number much more than thirty. If aurochs had similar social behaviour as their descendents, social status was gained through displays and fights, in which cows engaged as well as bulls."Frisch"Indeed, it was reported that aurochs bulls often had severe fights."vVuure05"As in other wild cattle, ungulates that form unisexual herds, there was considerable sexual dimorphism. Ungulates that form herds containing animals of both sexes, such as horses, have more weakly developed sexual dimorphism.mess2During the mating season, which probably took place during the late summer or early autumn,"vVuure05"the bulls had severe fights, and evidence from the forest of Jaktorów shows these could lead to death. In autumn, aurochs fed up for the winter and got fatter and shinier than during the rest of the year, according to Schneeberger."vVuure05"Calves were born in spring. According to Schneeberger the mother stayed at the calf's side until it was strong enough to join and keep up with the herd on the feeding grounds."vVuure05"Calves were vulnerable to wolves and to an extent, bears, while healthy adult aurochs probably did not have to fear these predators."vVuure05"In prehistoric Europe, North Africa and Asia, big cats, like lions and tigers, and hyenas were additional predators that probably preyed on aurochs."vVuure05"Historical descriptions, like Caesar’s ''De Bello Gallico'' or Schneeberger, tell that aurochs were swift and fast, and could be very aggressive. According to Schneeberger, aurochs were not concerned when a man approached. But, teased or hunted, an aurochs could get very aggressive and dangerous, and throw the teasing person into the air, as he described in a 1602 letter to Gesner."vVuure05"Habitat and distributionFloodplain forests like this one in Germany were the aurochs' last refuge during its final centuries of existence.There is no consensus concerning the habitat of the aurochs.  While some authors think that the habitat selection of the aurochs was comparable to the African forest buffalo, others describe the species as inhabiting open grassland and helping maintain open areas by grazing, together with other large herbivores.beutldrukeWith its hypsodont jaw, the aurochs was probably a grazer and had a food selection very similar to domestic cattle."vVuure05"It was not a browser like many deer species, nor a semi-intermediary feeder like the wisent."vVuure05"Comparisons of the isotope levels of Mesolithic aurochs and domestic cattle bones showed that aurochs probably inhabited wetter areas than domestic cattle.lynchSchneeberger describes that, during winter, the aurochs ate twigs and acorns in addition to grasses.After the beginning of the Common Era, the habitat of aurochs became more fragmented because of the steadily growing human population. During the last centuries of its existence, the aurochs was limited to remote regions, such as floodplain forests or marshes, where there were no competing domestic herbivores and less hunting pressure.Relationship with humansDomesticationImage:Bos primigenius Vig uroksen.jpg|thumb|left|This very large specimen is from around 7500 BC and is one of two very well-preserved aurochs skeletons found in Denmark. The Vig-aurochs can be seen at The National Museum of Denmark. The circles indicate where the animal was wounded by arrows.The aurochs, which ranged throughout much of Eurasia and Northern Africa during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, is the wild ancestor of modern cattle. Archaeological evidence shows that domestication occurred independently in the Near East and the Indian subcontinent between 10,000–8,000 years ago, giving rise to the two major domestic taxa observed today: humpless ''Bos taurus'' (taurine) and humped ''Bos indicus'' (zebu), respectively. This is confirmed by genetic analyses of matrilineal mitochondrial DNA sequences, which reveal a marked differentiation between modern ''Bos taurus'' and ''Bos indicus'' haplotypes, demonstrating their derivation from two geographically and genetically divergent wild populations."Edwards 2010"It is possible that there was a third domestication event from another form of the aurochs in Africa. The Sanga cattle, a zebu-like cattle with no back hump, is commonly believed to originate from crosses between humped-zebus with taurine cattle breeds. However, there is archaeological evidence that these cattle were domesticated independently in Africa and that bloodlines of taurine and zebu cattle were introduced only within the last few hundreds years.grigsonDomestication of the aurochs began in the southern Caucasus and northern Mesopotamia from about the 6th millennium BC. Genetic evidence suggests that aurochs were independently domesticated in India and possibly also in northern Africa. Domesticated cattle and aurochs are so different in size that they have been regarded as separate species; however, large ancient cattle and aurochs "are difficult to classify because morphological traits have overlapping distributions in cattle and aurochs and diagnostic features are identified only in horn and some cranial elements.""vVuure05""Beja"A Mitochondrial DNA study suggests that all domesticated taurine cattle originated from about 80 wild female aurochs in the Near East.nosource2oxfjCharles Hamilton Smith's copy of a painting possibly dating to the 16th centuryComparison of aurochs bones with those of modern cattle has provided many insights about the aurochs. Remains of the beast, from specimens believed to have weighed more than a ton, have been found in Mesolithic sites around Goldcliff, Wales.ch4Though aurochs became extinct in Britain during the Bronze Age, analysis of bones from aurochs that lived at about the same time as domesticated cattle showed no genetic contribution to modern breeds. As a result of this study, modern European cattle were thought to have descended directly from the Near East domestication. Another study found distinct similarities between modern breeds and Italian aurochs specimens, which suggested that the previously tested British aurochs were not a good model of the diversity of aurochs genetics. It also suggests possible North African and European aurochs contributions to domestic breeds."Beja"doi2doi3Further genetic tests have shown that domestic cattle in Europe are of Near Eastern origin. This indicates that the European aurochs was not domesticated, nor did it interbreed with the imported Near Eastern cattle.doi4abbtitIndian cattle (zebu), although domesticated eight to ten thousand years ago, are related to aurochs that diverged from the Near Eastern ones some 200,000 years ago. African cattle are thought to have descended from aurochs more closely related to the Near Eastern ones. The Near East and African aurochs groups are thought to have split some 25,000 years ago, probably 15,000 years before domestication. The "Turano-Mongolian" type of cattle now found in Northern China, Mongolia, Korea and Japan may represent a fourth domestication event (and a third event among ''Bos taurus''–type aurochs). This group may have diverged from the Near East group some 35,000 years ago. Whether these separate genetic populations would have equated to separate subspecies is unclear."Mannen2004"The maximum range of the aurochs was from Europe (excluding Ireland and northern Scandinavia), to northern Africa, the Middle East, India and Central Asia.chellobbcUntil at least 3,000 years ago, the aurochs was also found in Eastern China, where it is recorded at the Dingjiabao Reservoir in Yangyuan County. Most remains in China are known from the area east of 105° E, but the species has also been reported from the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau, close to the Heihe River.zonggExtinctionFile:Hunting horn of Sigismund III of Poland.jpg|thumb|The ornamented horn of the last aurochs bull that belonged to King Sigismund III of PolandFile:Jaktorow pomnik tura.jpg|thumb|left|The inscription reads: "The Aurochs - Bos primigenius bojanus, the ancestor of domestic cattle, lived in this forest Jaktorów until the year 1627."Already in the times of Herodotus (5th century BC) aurochs had disappeared from southern Greece but remained common in the area north and east of Echedorus river close to modern Thessaloniki."Ηρόδοτος" 5th century BC: Πολύμνια. Last reports of the species in the southern tip of the Balkans date to the 1st century BC when Varro reports that fierce wild oxen live in Dardania (southern Serbia) and Thrace.  By the 13th century AD, the aurochs' range was restricted to Poland, Lithuania, Moldavia, Transylvania and East Prussia. The right to hunt large animals on any land was restricted first to nobles and then, gradually, to only the royal households. As the population of aurochs declined, hunting ceased, and the royal court used gamekeepers to provide open fields for grazing for the aurochs. The gamekeepers were exempted from local taxes in exchange for their service. Poaching aurochs was punishable by death.According to the royal survey in 1564, the gamekeepers knew of 38 animals. The last recorded live aurochs, a female, died in 1627 in the Jaktorów Forest, Poland, from natural causes. The causes of extinction were unrestricted hunting, a narrowing of habitat due to the development of farming, and diseases transmitted by domestic cattle."vVuure05"rokoszCattle resembling the aurochsWhile all the wild subspecies are extinct, ''Bos primigenius'' lives on in domesticated cattle and attempts are being made to breed similar types suitable for filling the extinct subspecies' role in the wild.Less-derived cattle breedsBecause some cattle breeds have been changed more than other breeds, certain breeds (all belonging to the so-called landraces) bear a greater resemblance to the aurochs. These breeds are not very productive from the economical point of view, as they do not give as much milk or meat as others. Most of the ″primitive″ phenotypes are facing extinction, because farmers give them up for economic reasons or crossbreed them with more productive dairy and meat cattle. Very hardy and robust, the primitive breeds are sometimes used in nature conservation programs, where they can fill the place of their wild ancestor in the ecology.

Aurochs are depicted on the Ishtar Gate. Greeks and Paeonians were hunting aurochs (wild oxen/bulls) and used their huge horns as trophies, cups for wine and offers to the gods and heroes. For example, as mentioned by Samus, Philippus of Thessalonica and Antipater when Philip V of Macedon killed an aurochs on the foothills of mountain Orvilos he offered the horns which were 105cm long and the skin to a temple of Hercules."ReferenceA"Aurochs horns were often used by Romans as hunting horns. Aurochs were among those wild animals caught for fights (''venationes'') in arenas. Julius Caesar wrote about aurochs in ''Gallic War'' Chapter 6.28:"...those animals which are called uri. These are a little below the elephant in size, and of the appearance, colour, and shape of a bull. Their strength and speed are extraordinary; they spare neither man nor wild beast which they have espied. These the Germans take with much pains in pits and kill them. The young men harden themselves with this exercise, and practice themselves in this sort of hunting, and those who have slain the greatest number of them, having produced the horns in public, to serve as evidence, receive great praise. But not even when taken very young can they be rendered familiar to men and tamed. The size, shape, and appearance of their horns differ much from the horns of our oxen. These they anxiously seek after, and bind at the tips with silver, and use as cups at their most sumptuous entertainments.";/blockquote;The Hebrew Bible contains numerous references to the untameable strength of ''re'em'',bibletranslated as "bullock" or "wild-ox" in Jewish translations and translated rather poorly in the King James Version as "unicorn" but recognized from the last century by Hebrew scholars as the aurochs.commentsbiblecycWhen the aurochs became rarer, hunting it became a privilege of the nobility and a sign of a high social status. In the Nibelungenlied, the killing of aurochs by Siegfried is described: "''Darnach schlug er schiere einen Wisent und einen Elch, starker Ure viere und einen grimmen Schelch''","Frisch"meaning "''After that, he defeated one wisent and one elk, four aurochs and one Schelch''" - the background of the "Schelch" is dubious. Aurochs horns were commonly used as drinking horns by the nobility, which led to the fact that many aurochs horn sheaths are preserved today (albeit often discoloured). The drinking horn at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, given to the college on its foundation in 1352, probably  by the college's founders, the Guilds of Corpus Christi and the Blessed Virgin Mary, is thought to come from an aurochs. Furthermore, there is a painting by Willem Kalf depicting an aurochs horn. The horns of the last aurochs bulls, which died in 1620, were ornamented with gold and are located at the Livrustkammaren in Stockholm today.Schneeberger writes that aurochs were hunted with arrows, nets and hunting dogs. With immobilized aurochs, a ritual was practised that might be regarded as cruel nowadays: the curly hair on the forehead was cut from the skull of the living animal. Belts were made out of this hair and were believed to increase the fertility of women. When the aurochs was slaughtered, a cross-like bone was extracted from the heart. This bone, which is also present in domestic cattle, contributed to the mystique of the animal and magical powers have been attributed to it."vVuure05"File:Moldavia's coat of Arms of 1481.jpg|thumb|left|Coat of arms of Moldavia from 1481left|16th-century illustration by Teodoro Ghisi, believed to show an aurochs.

In Russia, a drunken person behaving badly was described as "behaving like an aurochs", whereas in Poland, big strong people were characterized as being "a bloke like an aurochs".vuureIn Central Europe the aurochs features in toponyms and heraldic coats of arms. For example, the names Ursenbach and Aurach am Hongar are derived from the aurochs. An aurochs head, the traditional arms of the German region Mecklenburg, figures in the coat of arms of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The aurochs (Romanian ''bour'', from Latin ''būbalus'') was also the symbol of Moldavia; nowadays they can be found in the coat of arms of both Romania and Moldova. In modern-day Romania, there are villages named Boureni. The horn of the aurochs is a charge of the coat of arms of Tauragė, Lithuania, (the name itself of Tauragė is a compound of ''taũras'' "auroch" and ''ragas'' "horn"). It is also present in the emblem of Kaunas, Lithuania, and was part of the emblem of Bukovina during its time as an Austro-Hungarian ''Kronland''. The Swiss Canton of Uri is named after the aurochs; its yellow flag shows a black aurochs head. East Slavic surnames Turenin, Turishchev, Turov, Turovsky originate from the Slavic name of the species ''tur''.fedosIn Slovakia there are toponyms like Turany, Turíčky, Turie, Turie Pole, Turík, Turová (villages), Turiec (river and region), Turská dolina (valley) and others. Turopolje, a large lowland floodplain south of the Sava river in Croatia, got its name from the once-abundant aurochs (Croatian: tur). The ancient name of the Estonian town of Rakvere, ''Tarwanpe'' or ''Tarvanpea'', probably derives from ''Auroch's head'' (''Tarvan pea'') in ancient Estonian.In 2002, a 3.5-m-high and 7.1-m-long statue of an aurochs was erected in Rakvere, Estonia for the town's 700th birthday. The sculpture, made by artist Tauno Kangro, has become a symbol of the town.rakveAurochs are frequently mentioned in the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, in which roasted aurochs are sometimes served at banquets.In the 2012 movie ''Beasts of the Southern Wild'', the six-year-old main character imagines aurochs, though the fantasy creatures are portrayed by "costumed" Vietnamese Pot-Bellied piglets.See also2Paleontology*Chillingham Cattle*Ur (rune)* American bison (''Bison bison'')* Beefalo* ''Bison antiquus''* ''Bison bonasus'' (European bison)* ''Bison latifrons'' (giant bison) (longhorn bison)* ''Bison priscus'' (steppe bison)* Bison* Bovid hybrid* Cattle, the domesticated animals descended from aurochs* European bison* Steppe bison* Texas Longhorn* Water buffalo* Wisent* Wood bison* Yak* Żubroń while separate species, the aurochs and the bison ("buffalo") are more closely related than asses and horses.
