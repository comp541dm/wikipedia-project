It has given rise to a number of branches of philosophy and psychology concerning emotion, disease, influence, and state of being. "Affection" is popularly used to denote a feeling or type of love, amounting to more than goodwill or friendship. Writers on ethics generally use the word to refer to distinct states of feeling, both lasting and spasmodic. Some contrast it with ''passion'' as being free from the distinctively sensual element.A simple expression of affection -through word or deed – can have a wide variety of emotional effects that range from joy to discomfort to outright fear. In fact, affection also has distinct physical effects – both for the receiver and the giver.Restricted definitionMore specifically, the word has been restricted to emotional states, the object of which is a living thing such as a human or animal.  Affection is compared with passion, from the Greek "pathos". As such it appears in the writings of French philosopher René Descartes, Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza, and most of the writings of early British ethicists.  However, on various grounds (e.g., that it does not involve anxiety or excitement and that it is comparatively inert and compatible with the entire absence of the sensuous element), it is generally and usefully distinguished from passion.  In this narrower sense the word has played a great part in ethical systems, which have spoken of the social or parental ''affections'' as in some sense a part of moral obligation.  For a consideration of these and similar problems, which depend ultimately on the degree in which the affections are regarded as voluntary, see H. Sidgwick, ''Methods of Ethics'' pp.345–349.ExpressionPublic display of affectionAffection can be communicated by words, gestures, or touches. Affectionate behavior may have evolved from parental nurturing behavior due to its associations with hormonal rewards.according to Communication professor Kory Floyd of the University of Arizona Such affection has been shown to influence brain development in infants.Expressions of affection can be unwelcome if they pose implied threats to one's well being. If welcomed, affectionate behavior  may be associated with  various health benefits. It has been proposed that positive sentiment increases the propensity of people to interact and that familiarity gained through affection increases positive sentiment among them.Affection can be displayed in different manners in different cultural societies. For example, in the Manchu ethnic group, mothers publicly kissing their infant is viewed as inappropriate, while publicly performing fellatio  on their infant son is considered an appropriate act of affection.See also* Affectional orientation* Affectionism* Affective filter* Affective videogames* Attraction* Crush* Doctrine of the affections* Emotion* Infatuation* List of emotions* List of terms of endearment* ''The Four Loves''* Terms of endearmentReferences'''Notes''''''Sources'''*Further reading*Janice Raymond. 2001.
