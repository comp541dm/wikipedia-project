other usesThe '''Black Russian''' is a cocktail of vodka and coffee liqueur. It contains five parts vodka to two parts coffee liqueur, per IBA specified ingredients. Traditionally the drink is made by pouring the vodka over ice cubes or cracked ice in an old-fashioned glass, followed by the coffee liqueur.This combination first appeared in 1949, and is ascribed to Gustave Tops, a Belgian barman, who created it at the Hotel Metropole in Brussels in honor of Perle Mesta, then U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg. The cocktail owes its name to the use of vodka, a typical Russian spirit, and the blackness of the coffee liqueur.Variations* '''Dirty Black Russian''', '''Tall Black Russian''', '''Australian Black Russian''' or '''Colorado Bulldog''': served in a highball glass and topped up with Cola.* '''Black Magic''': served with a dash of lemon juice and a lemon twist to garnish.* '''Irish Russian''' or '''Smooth Black Russian''': served with a head of Guinness stout."sicard"* '''Brown Russian''': served in a highball glass and topped with Ginger Ale.* '''Peri's Black Russian''': served in a high ball glass with vanilla vodka rather than plain, topped with coke* '''Vader''': served with JÃ¤germeister.*'''California Russian''': served with a shot of Triple Sec and a slice of orange.See also* White Russian, which adds a dairy ingredient (cream or milk) to the drink* List of cocktails* Liquor* Frederick Bruce Thomas, a man sometimes called "The Black Russian"References
