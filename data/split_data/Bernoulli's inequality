File:Bernoulli inequality.svg|right|thumb|An illustration of Bernoulli's inequality, with the graphs of y=(1 + x)^r and y=1 + rx shown in red and blue respectively. Here, r=3.In real analysis, '''Bernoulli's inequality''' (named after Jacob Bernoulli) is an inequality that approximates exponentiations of1+''x''.The inequality states that:(1 + x)^r \geq 1 + rx\!for every integer ''r''≥0 and every real number ''x''≥−1.If the exponent ''r'' is even, then the inequality is valid for ''all'' real numbers''x''. The strict version of the inequality reads:(1 + x)^r ; 1 + rx\!for every integer ''r''≥2 and every real number ''x''≥−1 with ''x''≠0.There is also a generalized version that says for every real number r ≥ 1 and real number x ≥ -1,:(1 + x)^r \geq 1 + rx,\!while for 0≤''r''≤1 and real number x ≥ -1,:(1 + x)^r \leq 1 + rx.\!Bernoulli's inequality is often used as the crucial step in the proof of other inequalities. It can itself be proved using mathematical induction, as shown below.HistoryJacob Bernoulli first published the inequality in his treatise “Positiones Arithmeticae de Seriebus Infinitis” (Basel, 1689), where he used the inequality often.[mathematics - First use of Bernoulli's inequality and its name - History of Science and Mathematics Stack Exchange;;]According to Joseph E. Hofmann, Über die Exercitatio Geometrica des M. A. Ricci (1963), p.177, the inequality is actually due to Sluse in his Mesolabum (1668 edition), Chapter IV "De maximis ; minimis".autogenerated1Proof of the inequalityFor ''r''=0,:(1+x)^0 \ge 1+0x \,is equivalent to 1≥1 which is true as required.Now suppose the statement is true for ''r''=''k''::(1+x)^k \ge 1+kx. \,Then it follows that:\begin{align}; {} \qquad (1+x)(1+x)^k \ge (1+x)(1+kx)\quad\text{(by hypothesis, since }(1+x)\ge 0) \\; \iff (1+x)^{k+1} \ge 1+kx+x+kx^2, \\; \iff (1+x)^{k+1} \ge 1+(k+1)x+kx^2.\end{align}However, as 1+(''k''+1)''x''+''kx''2≥1+(''k''+1)''x'' (since ''kx''2≥0), it follows that (1+''x'')''k''+1≥1+(''k''+1)''x'', which means the statement is true for ''r''=''k''+1 as required.By induction we conclude the statement is true for all''r''≥0.GeneralizationThe exponent ''r'' can be generalized to an arbitrary real number as follows: if ''x'';−1, then:(1 + x)^r \geq 1 + rx\!for ''r''≤0 or ''r''≥1, and:(1 + x)^r \leq 1 + rx\!for 0≤''r''≤1.This generalization can be proved by comparing derivatives.Again, the strict versions of these inequalities require ''x''≠0 and''r''≠0,1.Related inequalitiesThe following inequality estimates the ''r''-th power of 1 + ''x'' from the other side. For any real numbers ''x'',''r'';0, one has:(1 + x)^r \le e^{rx},\!where ''e'' = 2.718.... This may be proved using the inequality(1+1/''k'')''k'';''e''.Alternative formAn alternative form of Bernoulli's inequality for   t\geq 1  and   0\le x\le 1   is:: (1-x)^t \ge 1-xt.This can be proved (for integer t) by using the formula for geometric series: (using y=1-x):t=1+1+\dots+1 \ge 1+y+y^2+\ldots+y^{t-1}=\frac{1-y^t}{1-y}or equivalently xt \ge 1-(1-x)^t.Proof using AM-GMAn elementary proof for 0\le r\le 1 can be given using Weighted AM-GM.Let \lambda_1, \lambda_2 be two non-negative real constants. By Weighted AM-GM on 1,1+x with weights \lambda_1, \lambda_2 respectively, we get\dfrac{\lambda_1\cdot 1+\lambda_2\cdot (1+x)}{\lambda_1+\lambda_2}\ge \sqrt[\lambda_1+\lambda_2]{(1+x)^{\lambda_2}}Note that\dfrac{\lambda_1\cdot 1+\lambda_2\cdot (1+x)}{\lambda_1+\lambda_2}=\dfrac{\lambda_1+\lambda_2+\lambda_2x}{\lambda_1+\lambda_2}=1+\dfrac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1+\lambda_2}xand\sqrt[\lambda_1+\lambda_2]{(1+x)^{\lambda_2}}=(1+x)^{\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1+\lambda_2}}so our inequality is equivalent to1+\dfrac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1+\lambda_2}x\ge (1+x)^{\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1+\lambda_2}}After substituting r=\dfrac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1+\lambda_2} (bearing in mind that this implies 0\le r\le 1) our inequality turns into1+rx\ge (1+x)^r which is Bernoulli's inequality.NotesReferences***External links*** doi:10.4236/am.2013.47146|Paper “Some Equivalent Forms of Bernoulli’s Inequality: A Survey“
