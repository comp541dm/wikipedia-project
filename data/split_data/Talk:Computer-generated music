This is a subject which needs some work. Brian Eno's work with Koan generators might be a good starting point for someone. sjcLauri GröhnI wonder who continuosly deletes Synethesia from here. The software creates whole composition from pictures in a few seconds.MAX/MPX doesn't belong here. It is just a tool for composers! -—The preceding unsigned comment was added by LauriGrohn (talk • Special:Contributions/LauriGrohn|contribs) 07:48, 28 October 2006  (UTC{});:Don't add links to your own website. See WP:EL#Links normally to be avoided. If you think it's worth mentioning, put it here on the talk page and see if the rest of us think it's worth putting on the page. As for MAX/MSP, it's a very, very widely used tool in computer music (maybe even the most widely used software in this field). There is really no grounds for ommitting it.

Someone there is arguing the toss about what seems to me an indefensible claim (even with qualifications about the defintion) that one Bob Fink "was among the first to write a computer program that could compose melodies by itself" - in 1995!
