An enlargeable relief map of Chile with major roads and rail lines depicted.'''Transport in Chile''' is mostly by road. The south of the country is not connected to central Chile by road, except through Argentina, and water transport also plays a part there.  The railways were historically important in Chile, but now play a relatively small part in the country's transport system.  Because of the country's geography and long distances between major cities, aviation is also important.Road transportHighways*''total:'' 79,799km*''paved:'' 41,012km*''unpaved:'' 38,788km (1996 est.)*Chile Highway 5*Chile Highway 7*Chile Highway 9*Chile Highway 68*Chile Highway 181Freeways2,653km*Chile Freeway 6*Chile Freeway 8*Autopista del Sol*Autopista del ItataBusesTransantiago, Santiago's public bus system.Buses are now the main means of long distance transportation in Chile, following the decline of the rail network.[Omnilineas website]  The bus system covers the whole country, from Arica to Santiago (a 30 hour journey) and from Santiago to Punta Arenas (about 40 hours, with a change at Osorno).  There are also international services to most other countries in South America. Longer-distance services are mostly on ''semi-cama'' (reclining seat) or ''cama'' (sleeper) buses, often double deck.Santiago began its public bus system Transantiago in 2007.Concepción, Chile|Concepción's "Bio Bus" integrates with the electric train, Biotren, and is based on a dedicated right of way for buses.For schedules and fares in Chile:[www.buschile.com]RailwaysRail transport in Chile*''total:'' 6,782km*''broad gauge:'' 3,743km 5ft6in gauge (1,653km electrified)*''narrow gauge'': 116km  gauge; 2,923km 1000mm gauge (40km electrified) (1995)*''standard gauge:'' 40km sg (from Arica to Tacna, Peru)Not all lines connect.Chile's railways (except for a few dedicated industrial lines) are operated by the state owned company ''Empresa de los Ferrocarriles del Estado'' (EFE), which completed a major investment programme in 2005.The rail system once served the entire country, running rail lines from Arica in the north to Puerto Montt in the south. Due partly to the nature of the terrain and evolution in transportation systems, rail travel has suffered greatly at the hands of bus and air competition. The train usually takes longer to reach a destination than a bus, and the comfort is comparable. Prices also tend to be uncompetitive.  Rail freight transport has also suffered at the hands of the trucking industry and will continue to do so due to the immense leverage the truck driver's union can bring to bear if they were to feel threatened.The Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia is a metre gauge railway in the north of the country.  It was originally constructed in 2ft6in gauge.The northern rail line out of Santiago is now disused past the intersection with the Valparaíso line. Until there it is used nearly exclusively for freight. Although the rest of the northern line is still in place, it is in a state of serious disrepair.The southern line runs as far as Puerto Montt and is electrified as far as the city of Temuco, from where diesel locomotives are used.  Due to lack of budget and care, the 389km Temuco to Puerto Montt section was abandoned in 1992 but after a $44m upgrade it has been back in use since 6 December 2005 with daily service between Victoria (north of Temuco) and Puerto Montt; today, however only the service between Victoria and Temuco still operates.Work to build/restore(?) the South Trans-Andean Railway link between Zapala, Argentina and Lonquimay, Chile was underway in 2005. Possible break-of-gauge. Possible rack railway.Construction was undertaken by Patagonia Ferrocanal SA, formed and funded by the province. The first 7km was completed by January 2006.There have been repeated case studies regarding the installation of a high speed line between the cities of Valparaíso and Santiago, some even considering maglev trains, but no serious action has ever been taken on the matter.Rail links with adjacent countries* Bolivia - yes - same gauge 1000mm - from Arica to La Paz, Bolivia* Argentina - Central Trans-Andean Railway  - abandoned 1984 – 100km of mountain railway of 1000mm gauge with rack railway sections - break of gauge 1676mm/1000mm at either end.
