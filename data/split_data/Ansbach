'''Ansbach''' (; ) is a city in the German state of Bavaria. It is the capital of the administrative region of Middle Franconia. Ansbach is situated  southwest of Nuremberg and  north of Munich, on the Fränkische Rezat (Rezat River), a tributary of the Main river. As of 2004, its population was 40,723.Developed in the 8th century as a Benedictine monastery, it became the seat of the Hohenzollern family in 1331. In 1460, the Margraves of Margraviate of Branderberg–Anspach|Branderberg-Anspach lived here. The city has a castle known as Markgrafenschloß|Margrafen–Schloss, built between 1704-1738. It was not badly damaged during the World Wars and hence retains its original historical baroque sheen.  Ansbach is now home to a US military base and to the Ansbach University of Applied Sciences.The city has connections via autobahn A6 and highways Bundesstraße 13|B13 and Bundesstraße 14|B14. Ansbach station is on the Nuremberg–Crailsheim railway|Nürnberg–Crailsheim and Treuchtlingen–Würzburg railway|Treuchtlingen–Würzburg railways and is the terminus of line S4 of the Nuremberg S-Bahn.Name origin'''Ansbach''' was originally been called '''Onoltesbach''' (about 790 AD), a term composed of three parts.The individual word elements are "Onold" (the city founders name), the Suffix "-es" (in this relation it can be translated with "sb. owns sth.") and the Old High German expression "pah" or "bach" (for Brook). The name of the city has slightly changed throughout the centuries into '''Onoltespah''' (837 AD), '''Onoldesbach''' (1141 AD), '''Onoldsbach''' (1230 AD), '''Onelspach''' (1338 AD), '''Onsbach''' (1508 AD) and finally '''Ansbach''' (1732 AD).Wolf-Armin von Reitzenstein: '''' (eng: "Lexicon to franconian toponymy"), Verlag C.

A Guide to name origins and significance"), Dümmler Verlag, Rastatt 1961, (in German)It was also formerly known as '''Anspach'''.HistoryAccording to folklore, towards the end of the 7th centurie a group of franconian peasants and their families went up into the wilderness to found a new settlement. Their leader Onold led them to a area called the "Rezattal" (Rezat valley). This is where they founded the "Urhöfe" (meaning the first farms: Knollenhof, Voggenhof and Rabenhof). Gradually more settlers, such as the "Winden-Tribe" came and the farms grew into a small village. Many villages around Ansbach were founded by the "Winden" during that period (even today their settlements can easily identified by their names, like "Meinhards'''winden'''", "Dauten'''winden'''" or "Brods'''winden'''" for example).A Benedictine monastery was established there around 748 by the Frankish noble Gumbertus|StGumbertus. The adjoining village of Onoltesbach is first noticed as a proper town in 1221.Werner Bürger: ''Heimatgeschichte der Stadt Ansbach'' (eng: "The history of Ansbach"), Oldenburg Verlag, Munich 1990, (in German)The counts of County of Öttingen|Öttingen ruled over Ansbach until the Hohenzollern burgraves of Burgraviate of Nürnberg|Nürnberg took over in 1331. The Hohenzollerns made Ansbach the seat of their dynasty until their acquisition of the Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1415. After the 1440 death of Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg|FrederickI, a cadet branch of the family established itself as the margraves of Ansbach. George the Pious introduced the Protestant Reformation to Ansbach in 1528, leading to the secularization of Gumbertus Abbey in 1563.The Markgrafenschloß|Margrafen–Schloss was built between 1704-1738; its gardens continued to be a notable attraction into the 19th century.1878 In 1791, the last margrave sold his realm to the Kingdom of Prussia.1878 In 1796, the Duke of Duchy of Zweibrücken|Zweibrücken, Maximilian Joseph—the future Bavarian king Max I Joseph—was exiled to Ansbach after Zweibrücken had been taken by the French. In Ansbach, Maximilian von Montgelas wrote an elaborate concept for the future political organization of Bavaria, which is known as the Ansbacher Mémoire.[?] In 1806, Napoleon forced Prussia to cede Ansbach and its principality to Bavaria.1878 The act was confirmed by the 1815 Congress of Vienna;1878 Prussia was compensated with the Bavarian duchy of Berg. Ansbach became the capital of the circle of Middle Franconia following the unification of Germany; at the time, it had a population of 12,635.1878Jewish families were resident in Ansbach from at least the end of the 18th century. They set up a Jewish Cemetery in the Ruglaender Strasse, which was vandalised and razed under the Nazi tyranny. It was repaired in 1946, but it was damaged several times more. A plaque on the wall of the cemetery commemorates these events. The Jewish Congregation built its synagogue at No 3 Rosenbadstrasse, but it too was damaged by the SA, though it was not burnt down for fear of damaging the neighbouring buildings. It serves today as a "Symbolic House of God". A plaque in the entrance serves as a memorial to the synagogue and to Jewish residents who were murdered during the Holocaust.:de:Ansbach In 1940, at least 500 patients were deported from the Heil- und Pflegeanstalt Ansbach [''Ansbach Medical and Nursing Clinic''] to the extermination facilities Sonnenstein and Hartheim which were disguised as psychiatric institutions, as part of the Action T4 euthanasia action. They were gassed there. At the clinic in Ansbach itself, around 50 intellectually disabled children were injected with the drug Luminal and killed that way. A plaque was erected in their memory in 1988 in the local hospital at No. 38 Feuchtwangerstrasse."de.wikipedia.org"During World War II, a subcamp of Flossenbürg concentration camp was located here.[Christine O'Keefe. ''Concentration Camps.''] Also during the Second World War the Luftwaffe and Wehrmacht had bases here. The nearby airbase was the home station for the Stab ; I/KG53 (Staff ; 1st Group of Kampfgeschwader 53) operating 38 Heinkel He 111 bombers. On 1 September 1939 this unit was one of the many that participated in the attack on Poland that started the war. All of its bridges were destroyed during the course of the war. During the Western Allied invasion of Germany in April 1945, the airfield was seized by the United States Third Army, and used by the USAAF 354th Fighter Group which flew P-47 Thunderbolts from the aerodrome (designated ALG R-82) from late April until the German capitulation on 7 May 1945.[354 Operations Group Fact Sheet, USAFHRA][USAAF Airfields in the ETO] At the end of the war, 19-year-old student Robert Limpert tried to get the town to surrender to the US Forces without a fight. He was betrayed by Hitler Youth and was hung from the portal of the City Hall by the city's military commander, Col. (''Oberst'') Ernst Meyer. Several memorials to his heroic deed have been erected over the years, despite opposition from some residents — in the Ludwigskirche, in the Gymnasium Carolinum and at No 6 Kronenstrasse."de.wikipedia.org"After the Second World War, Ansbach belonged to the American Zone. The American Military authorities established a displaced persons (DP) camp in what used to be a sanatorium in what is today the Strüth quarter."de.wikipedia.org"Bachwoche Ansbach has been held in Ansbach since 1947.
