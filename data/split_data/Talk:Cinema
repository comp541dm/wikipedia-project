Most of this discussion has taken place on Talk:Film.----"'' Much of the industry is centered around Hollywood, California, although other regional centers exist.''"Is this related to the US film industry ? If this is about world cinema, then its a POV statement. Jay 17:31, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC):Do it, rather than whine.

A problematic part I can think is the fact that these web sites are taking IP addresses that should be used for things like longer-lasting web sites. Easier to remember, yes - but a waste of addresses months later, maybe.I don't know how soon will the IP address pool for internet service providers big and small is going to go into a shortage (leading to the need for IPv6), but the web site designers and maintenance people should pool all of the movie web sites to that of the address of the movie company itself instead of using all of those addresses.As far as the IP thing goes, for those that don't know....With the advent of HTTP 1.1, you can host multiple domains on a single IP address (They call these Virtual domains). There is limit on these things in a practical sense, but ideally, with the proper load balance you could host unlimited domains from a single address.The crime here is not the waste of IP addresses but the wasting of some really good domain names.Of all people to first get a clue, SONY has actually gone ahead and simply put all their films underOf course, their real reason for it is most likely they wanna save the registration fee for all them shitbag movies they churn out.One more fact pointing to the truth: Hollywood SucksIf you have any clarifications about how these addresses are used, please reply.Cinema or Film?There are lots of kinds of film besides cinema - photographic film, plastic wrap film, thin oil films on water, thin film electronics, etc.There are not so many for cinema.I think Cinema should be the lead article, film should be a disambiguation page IMHO.
