'''Ahmed III''' (Ottoman Turkish: احمد ثالث ''Aḥmed-i s;/u;ālis;/u;'') (December 30/31, 1673 – July 1, 1736) was Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and a son of Sultan Mehmed IV (1648–87). His mother was Emetullah Rabia Gülnûş Sultan|Mâh-Pâre Ummatullah (Emetullah) Râbi'a Gül-Nûş Valide Sultan, originally named Evmania Voria, who was an ethnic Greek. He was born at Hajioglupazari, in Dobruja. He succeeded to the throne in 1703 on the abdication of his brother Mustafa II (1695–1703). Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha and his daughter, Hatice Sultan (wife of the former) directed the government from 1718 to 1730, a period referred to as the ''Tulip Era''.BiographyAhmed III cultivated good relations with France, doubtless in view of Russia's menacing attitude; in fact, both his wives were Frenchwomen. He afforded refuge in Ottoman territory to Charles XII of Sweden (1682–1718) after the Swedish defeat at the hands of Peter I of Russia (1672–1725) in the Battle of Poltava of 1709. In 1710 Charles XII convinced Sultan Ahmed III to declare war against Russia, and the Ottoman forces under Baltacı Mehmet Pasha won a major victory at the Battle of Prut. In the aftermath, Russia returned Azov back to the Ottomans, agreed to demolish the fortress of Taganrog and others in the area, and to stop interfering in the affairs of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.Forced against his will into war with Russia, Ahmed III came nearer than any Ottoman sovereign before or since to breaking the power of his northern rival, whose armies his grand vizier Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha succeeded in completely surrounding at the Pruth River Campaign in 1711. The subsequent Ottoman victories against Russia enabled the Ottoman Empire to advance to Moscow, had the Sultan wished. However, this was halted as a report reached Constantinople: "When the Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923, the capital was moved to Ankara, and Constantinople was officially renamed Istanbul in 1930." that the Safavids were invading the Ottoman Empire, causing a period of panic, turning the Sultan's attention away from Russia.Sultan Ahmed III had become unpopular by reason of the excessive pomp and costly luxury in which he and his principal officers indulged; on September 20, 1730, a mutinous riot of seventeen Janissaries, led by the Albanian Patrona Halil, was aided by the citizens as well as the military until it swelled into an insurrection in front of which the Sultan was forced to give up the throne.Ahmed voluntarily led his nephew Mahmud I (1730–54) to the seat of sovereignty and paid allegiance to him as Sultan of the Empire. He then retired to the Kafes previously occupied by Mahmud and died at Topkapı Palace after six years of confinement.Character of Ahmed III's ruleFile:Jean-Baptiste van Mour 006.jpg|thumb|Sultan Ahmed III receives French ambassador Vicomte d'Andrezel at Topkapı Palace.File:Marquis de Bonnac being received by Sultan Ahmed III.jpg|thumb|French ambassador Marquis de Bonnac being received by Sultan Ahmed III.Sultan Ahmed III at a reception, painted in 1720The reign of Ahmed III, which had lasted for twenty-seven years, although marked by the disasters of the Great Turkish War, was not unsuccessful. The recovery of Azov and the Morea, and the conquest of part of Persia, managed to counterbalance the Balkan territory ceded to the Habsburg Monarchy through the Treaty of Passarowitz, after the Ottoman Empire was defeated in Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18. In 1716, he sent an army of 33,000 men to capture Corfu from the Republic of Venice.Ahmed III left the finances of the Ottoman Empire in a flourishing condition, which had remarkably been obtained without excessive taxation or extortion procedures. He was a cultivated patron of literature and art, and it was in his time that the first printing press authorized to use the Arabic or Turkish languages was set up in Constantinople, operated by Ibrahim Muteferrika (while the printing press had been introduced to Constantinople in 1480, all works published before 1729 were in Greek, Armenian, or Hebrew).It was in this reign that an important change in the government of the Danubian Principalities was introduced: previously, the Porte had appointed Hospodars, usually native Moldavian and Wallachian boyars, to administer those provinces; after the Russian campaign of 1711, during which Peter the Great found an ally in Moldavia Prince Dimitrie Cantemir, the Porte began overtly deputizing Phanariote Greeks in that region, and extended the system to Wallachia after Prince Stefan Cantacuzino established links with Eugene of Savoy. The Phanariotes constituted a kind of ''Dhimmi'' nobility, which supplied the Porte with functionaries in many important departments of the state.Relations with the Mughal EmpireJahandar ShahIn the year 1712, the Mughal Emperor Jahandar Shah, a grandson of Aurangzeb sent gifts to the Ottoman Sultan Ahmad III and referred to himself as the Ottoman Sultan's devoted admirer.FarrukhsiyarThe Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar a grandson of Aurangzeb, is also known to have sent a letter to the Ottomans but this time it was received by the Grand Vizier Nevşehirli Damad Ibrahim Pasha providing a graphic description of the efforts of the Mughal commander Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha against the Rajput and Maratha rebellion.Marriages and issue  [retrieved 4 March 2016].Consorts* Emetullah Banu Bas Kadin Effendi (d. 1732), daughter of 'Abdu'l Minnan.* Rukiya Kadin Effendi (d. 1738), styled ''2nd Kadin Effendi''.* Emine Mihrişah Sultan|Aminā (Emine) Mihrişah Effendi, styled ''2nd Kadin Effendi''; mother of Mustafa III.* Khadija Kadin Effendi (d. 1712), styled ''2nd Kadin''.* Shahin Kadin Effendi (d. 1723), styled ''3rd Kadin''.* Rabia Sharmi Effendi, mother of Abdul Hamid I.* Amina Mushalli Kadin Effendi (d. 1750).* Zainab Kadin Effendi (d. 1757).* Gul-Shan Kadin Effendi (d. 1731).* Fatima Kadin Effendi (d. 1732).* Ummu Kulsum Kadin Effendi (d. 1768).* Husn-i-Shah Kadin  (d. 1733).* Fatima Huma-Shah Kadin Effendi (d. 1742).* Hürrem Kadınefendi|Hurram Kadin Effendi (1692 – 1760).* Mayli Kadin Effendi.* Nazifa Kadin Effendi.* Nijad Kadin Effendi.* Hanifa Kadin Effendi.* Aisha Buhari Khanum Effendi alias ''Mihri Haji Iqbal''.* Shayasta Khanum (d. 1722).* Hatim Khanum Effendi (1695 – 1772).Sons* Şehzade Mehmed (1 March 1697 – June 1703).* Şehzade Ibrahim (1704 – bef. 1720).* Şehzade Mehmed (25 November 1705 – 20 June 1706).* Şehzade Murad (January 1706 – 5 April 1708).* Şehzade Isa (23 February 1706 – 25 May 1706), son of Hurram Kadin Effendi.* Şehzade Ali (18 June 1706 – 12 September 1706).* Şehzade Selim (6 September 1707 – 4 May 1708), son of Hurram Kadin Effendi.* Şehzade Murad (17 November 1707 – died young).* Şehzade Murad (4 February 1708 – 1 April 1708).* Şehzade Abdul Majid (12 December 1709 – 8 March 1710), twin with Abdul Malik.* Şehzade Abdul Malik (12 December 1709 – 7 March 1711), twin with Abdul Majid.* Şehzade Mustafa (born 1710 – died young).* Şehzade Sultan Sulaiman Khan (25 August 1710 – 11 December 1732), son of Aminā (Emine) Mihrişah Effendi.* Şehzade Mehmed (17 October 1712 – 15 July 1713), son of Hurram Kadin Effendi.* Şehzade Selim (1712 – 11 July 1715).* Şehzade Mahmud (17 October 1713 – 22 December 1756).* Şehzade Selim (20 April 1715 – February 1718), twin with Saliha Sultan; son of Hatim Khanum Effendi.* Şehzade ....

The Sultan is in the company of five other deposed European monarchs, and he tells Candide, who initially doubts his credentials:I am not jesting, my name is Achmet III. For several years I was Sultan; I dethroned my brother; my nephew dethroned me; they cut off the heads of my viziers; I am ending my days in the old seraglio; my nephew, Sultan Mahmoud, sometimes allows me to travel for my health, and I have come to spend the Carnival at Venice." ;/blockquote;This episode was taken up by the modern Turkish writer Nedim Gürsel as the setting of his 2001 novel ''Le voyage de Candide à Istanbul''.In fact, there is no evidence of the deposed Sultan being allowed to make such foreign travels, nor did Voltaire (or Gürsel) assert that it had any actual historical foundation.See also* Fountain of Ahmed III* Fountain of Ahmed III (Üsküdar)* Ibrahim Muteferrika* Esma Sultan, daughter of Ahmed III*The Ottomans: Europe's Muslim EmperorsReferencesSources* This article incorporates text from the ''History of Ottoman Turks'' (1878)*External links+July 1, 1736[aged 62]su
