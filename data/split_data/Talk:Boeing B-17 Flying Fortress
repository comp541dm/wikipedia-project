Instead it splits the subjects and interjects numerious intervening titled and untitled paragraphs that disrupt the continuity and chronolgy of the fundamental design ; development storyline.Moreover, either the standard format is not present; or if present, the content deviates from the heading, thoughout much of the article.  The result is a meandering and disorganized presentatiion complete with redundencies and contradictions.  What ever praise the article once enjoyed is no longer in evidence.  To understand this more objectively, outline the article in hard copy, complete with hierarchy, given each topic its heading. Look at the results and form your assessment.  Mine found the article has been amended too often in piecemeal, and suffers accordingly. It needs an overhaul....and oh, I have no desire to participate in this process.  I abdicate that to R. Freeman (dec) and David Osborne and their B-17 Flying Fortress Story.  The latter has reviewed the individual history for every one of the 12, 730 B-17 that have a card on file and supplement those histories in many ways.  And that one model 299, never a B-17, is also in the book.  So when instead you choose the 1963 work of Bowers in any reiteration, be cognizant of want you are rejecting.  You can use a map of the flat earth, but you won t soar to new heights.—Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/2600:1002:B122:67F8:E0C2:D605:D761:5A5|2600:1002:B122:67F8:E0C2:D605:D761:5A5 (talk) 14:31, 1 June 2015 (UTC);;; ;;Combat boxthe combat box initiated by Le May and adopted in the VIIII BC was an 18 plane formation stacked high and low of the lead  six.  it was NOT the diamond 12 shown.   the unsourced, incorrect graphic is recommened for removal.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/2600:1002:B00D:405:FA26:7363:F8F0:2AAE|2600:1002:B00D:405:FA26:7363:F8F0:2AAE (talk) 09:54, 4 June 2015 (UTC);;; ;;Variants tableref: The B-17 Flying Fortress Story; Freeman ; Osborne; 1998. this book is authoritative and contains a synopsis of the official aircraft history cards for each B-17 ( less a few NIF). The number of F-DL is less than the 600 first ordered from Long Beach, not the 605 stated in the chart. That number is cited to Bowers (#53) work which is a reinteration of his 1963 colaboration ( also cited in the article). That 1963 was based on factory production planning records and not actual production. The F-DL series ended at block 65. The blocks G-1 into 10 account for DL # 530 to 605 and seq. 529 F-DL.

Do the math.B-17H vs SB-17...againThe article now has the order both ways in different places.  The mission prefix for the SAR dates to 1948. The H SERIES was the AAF war time designation.  The ATC/ MATS assumption of the role was post war.  The wartime AAF had about a half dozen ASR emergency rescue squadrons (ERS) and most used the B-17H at least at some point.  See Craven ; Cate Vol VII for a whole chapter on the subject.  Meanwhile the article needs some repair, consistency, clarification of timeframes and removal of redundencies.  or find the coverage that was reverted and restore it.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/2600:1002:B023:61A7:BF0A:E9DC:25D8:F585|2600:1002:B023:61A7:BF0A:E9DC:25D8:F585 (talk) 01:18, 5 June 2015 (UTC);;; ;;CAREY (ref 7 ; BIBLIOGRAPHY) 404 errorand with it goes the credibility of Defeat of the Wehrmacht as the CBO primary objective.  citation needed now.:No. Citation still stands, and fortunately archive.org "is your friend" .

MilborneOne (talk) 15:19, 5 June 2015 (UTC)A service ceiling greater than any of its Allied contemporaries?Isn't this factually incorrect? The de Havilland Mosquito had a service ceiling of 11,000m which is greater. Maybe the text should read '... than any contemporary allied '''heavy''' bombers.:I wouldnt have considered the Mosquito as a contemporary of the B-17. MilborneOne (talk) 11:17, 28 July 2015 (UTC)Jesus wept. Somebody's awfully desperate to award the B-17 an undeserved propaganda superlative. The United States wasn't allied with anyone till December 1941. The passage at issue refers to the B-17's war service with the USAAF (and not its first, unsuccessful period in action with 90 Squadron RAF in summer 1941). The term 'Allied contemporaries' therefore means 'US and British bombers of the Second World War', so both the Mosquito and the B-29 beat the B-17 hollow. On operations it actually flew at around 25,000 - 26,000. When the RAF tried to fly it higher, it didn't work because the engines bled oil in the low air pressure and the oil caked on the tailplane and froze and seized the elevators. Plus the oxygen system froze, the radios froze and the guns jammed. Later models used by the Eighth Air Force (and redesigned in light of 90 Squadron's experience, with far more guns and a bigger tailfin to counter the directional instability) were much heavier and couldn't reach 30,000 at operational load anyway. So the article is awarding an undeserved propaganda superlative.

Robert V. Mercer to Wiki B-17 PageGreetings,My name is Dean Carter. I am a first time Wikipedia contributor.I have attempted to enter information regarding B-17 Pilot LT. Robert V. Mercer (1923-1945).LT. Mercer died in January 1945, after his B-17 took heavy flak and caught fire. He ordered his entire crew to bail out, including his Co-Pilot, Lt. Charles Taylor (Whom sadly died of impact injuries sustained from the jump) but which saved the lives of the other six men.LT. Mercer also avoided the small village of Tournai, Belgium, sparing many civilian lives.This act of sacrifice was witnessed by many of the village residents, whom in 2008, had Belgium dedicate an official memorial to LT. Mercer and the crew.LT. Mercer also has an entire chapter concerning him in James Hammond's (Award winning Journalist and former Wall Street Journal writer), book, "Tom's War". A book concerning his father, Tom Hammond, also a B-17 pilot and friend of LT. Mercer's.My question is in my novice attempt to insert this information to the B-17 page, it seems I am doing it correctly, as I can see a "Updated" page after I insert the new info, but when I check back in an hour it is not updated.What do you think I am doing wrong, or am I having to await an "Approval"?Thanks much for any help.Cordially,Dean CarterCarter1969 (talk) 21:29, 16 January 2016 (UTC)Wilmington, NC, USAExternal links modifiedHello fellow Wikipedians,I have just added archive links to 1 external links on Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress.
