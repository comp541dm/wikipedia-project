The '''Cebidae''' is one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It includes the capuchin monkeys and squirrel monkeys.SAPThese species are found throughout tropical and subtropical South and Central America.CharacteristicsCebid monkeys are arboreal animals that only rarely travel on the ground. They are generally small monkeys, ranging in size ;; up to that of the brown capuchin, with a body length of 33 to 56cm, and a weight of 2.5 to 3.9 kilograms. They are somewhat variable in form and coloration, but all have the wide, flat, noses typical of New World monkeys. They are different from marmosets as they have additional molar tooth and a prehensile tail.They are omnivorous, mostly eating fruit and insects, although the proportions of these foods vary greatly between species. They have the dental formula:Females give birth to one or two young after a gestation period of between 130 and 170 days, depending on species. They are social animals, living in groups of between five and forty individuals, with the smaller species typically forming larger groups. They are generally diurnal in habit.ClassificationPreviously, New World monkeys were divided between Callitrichidae and this family. For a few recent years, marmosets, tamarins, and lion tamarins were placed as a subfamily (Callitrichinae) in Cebidae, while moving other genera from Cebidae into the families Aotidae, Pitheciidae and Atelidae.msw3The most recent classification of New World monkeys again splits the callitrichids off, leaving only the capuchins and squirrel monkeys in this family.SAP* '''Family Cebidae''': capuchins and squirrel monkeysImage:Cebus albifrons edit.jpg|thumb|right|White-fronted capuchin (''Cebus albifrons'')** Subfamily Cebinae*** Genus ''Cebus''**** Kaapori capuchin, ''Cebus kaapori''**** Wedge-capped capuchin, ''Cebus olivaceus''**** White-headed capuchin, ''Cebus capucinus''**** White-fronted capuchin, ''Cebus albifrons''*** Genus ''Sapajus''**** Black-striped capuchin, ''Sapajus libidinosus''**** Black capuchin, ''Sapajus nigritus''**** Blond capuchin, ''Sapajus flavius''**** Golden-bellied capuchin, ''Sapajus xanthosternos''**** Tufted capuchin, ''Sapajus apella''Image:common.squirrel.monkey.arp.jpg|right|thumb|Common squirrel monkey (''Saimiri sciureus'')** Subfamily Saimiriinae*** Genus ''Saimiri''**** Bare-eared squirrel monkey, ''Saimiri ustus''**** Black squirrel monkey, ''Saimiri vanzolini''**** Black-capped squirrel monkey, ''Saimiri boliviensis''**** Central American squirrel monkey, ''Saimiri oerstedi''**** Common squirrel monkey, ''Saimiri sciureus''Extinct taxa*Subfamily Cebinae**Genus ''Acrecebus''***''Acrecebus fraileyi''**Genus ''Dolichocebus''***''Dolichocebus gaimanensis''**Genus ''Chilecebus''***''Chilecebus carrascoensis''**Genus ''Neosaimiri''***''Neosaimiri fieldsi''**Genus ''Laventiana''***''Laventiana annectens''ReferencesCebidae
