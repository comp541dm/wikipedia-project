I'm not saying the entry from Bulfinch's Mythology is a bad start (actually, it's great), but for the record, I would definitely draw a distinction between a proper encyclopedia article and simply a (19th century) retelling of a myth.  The encyclopedia article might indeed retell the myth, but it would put the whole thing into historical, literary, religious, and other contexts. --Larry Sanger
