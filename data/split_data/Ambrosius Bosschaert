His brother-in-law Balthasar van der Ast also lived and worked in his workshop and moved with him on his travels. Bosschaert later worked in Amsterdam (1614), Bergen op Zoom (1615;ndash;1616), Utrecht (1616;ndash;1619), and Breda (1619).RKDIn 1619 when he moved to Utrecht, his brother-in-law van der Ast entered the Utrecht Guild of St. Luke, where the renowned painter Abraham Bloemaert had just become dean. The painter Roelandt Savery (1576–1639) entered the St. Luke’s guild in Utrecht at about the same time. Savery had considerable influence on the Bosschaert dynasty.RKDWhen Bosschaert died in The Hague while on commission there for a flower piece, Balthasar van der Ast took over running his workshop and pupils.RKDStyleImage:Fruit still life with shells.jpg|right|thumb|250px| Fruit still life with shells painted by Balthasar van der Ast.His bouquets were painted symmetrically and with scientific accuracy in small dimensions and normally on copper. They sometimes included symbolic and religious meanings. At the time of his death, Bosschaert was working on an important commission in the Hague.RKDThat piece is now in the collection in Stockholm.RKDin the RKD Bosschaert became one of the first artists to specialize in still life painting, and he started a tradition of painting detailed flower bouquets, which typically included tulips and roses. Thanks to the booming seventeenth-century Dutch art market, he became highly successful, as the inscription on one of his paintings attests.[Painting with inscription] at the National GalleryLegacyHis sons and his pupil and brother-in-law, Balthasar van der Ast, were among those to uphold the Bosschaert dynasty which continued until the mid-17th century.It may not be a coincidence that this trend coincided with a national obsession with exotic flowers which made flower portraits highly sought after.Although he was highly in demand, he did not create many pieces because he was also employed as an art dealer.Selected worksFile:Ambrosius Bosschaert, the Elder 01.jpg|Still-Life of FlowersFile:Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder - Bouquet of Flowers in a Glass Vase - Google Art Project.jpg|Bouquet of Flowers in a Glass VaseFile:Ambrosius Bosschaert, the Elder 02.jpg|Still-Life of FlowersFile:Bosschaert the Elder, Still Life with Flowers in a Porcelain Vase.jpg|Roses, tulips, anemone and cyclamen  in a porcelain vaseFile:Ambrosius Bosschaert - Bouquet of Flowers on a Ledge - Google Art Project.jpg| Bouquet of Flowers on a LedgeFile:Ambrosius Bosschaert, the Elder 03.jpg|''Vase of Flowers in a Window Niche'' (Mauritshuis)File:Ambrosius Bosschaert, the Elder 06.jpg|Still-Life of FlowersReferences*External linksAmbrosius Bosschaert (I)* on Artnet
