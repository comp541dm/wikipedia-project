Carboniferous (album)The '''Carboniferous''' is a geologic period and system that extends from the end of the Devonian Period, at 358.9 ± 0.4 million years ago, to the beginning of the Permian Period, at 298.9 ± 0.15 Ma. The name ''Carboniferous'' means "coal-bearing" and derives from the Latin words ''wikt:carbo#Latin|carbō'' (“coal”) and ''wikt:fero#Latin|ferō'' (“I bear, I carry”), and was coined by geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822.Rev. W. D. Conybeare and William Phillips, ''Outlines of the Geology of England and Wales'' …, Part I, (London, England: William Phillips, 1822). On page 323, Conybeare titles the chapter  Based on a study of the British rock succession, it was the first of the modern 'system' names to be employed, and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during this time. The Carboniferous is often treated in North America as two geological periods, the earlier Mississippian and the later Pennsylvanian.Terrestrial life was well established by the Carboniferous period.  Amphibians were the dominant land vertebrates, of which one branch would eventually evolve into reptiles, the first fully terrestrial vertebrates. Arthropods were also very common, and many (such as ''Meganeura'') were much larger than those of today. Vast swaths of forest covered the land, which would eventually be laid down and become the coal beds characteristic of the Carboniferous system. The atmospheric content of oxygen also reached their highest levels in history during the period, 35% compared with 21% today. This increased the atmospheric density by a third over today’s value.Beerling2007A minor marine and terrestrial extinction event occurred in the middle of the period, caused by a change in climate. The later half of the period experienced glaciations, low sea level, and mountain building as the continents collided to form Pangaea.SubdivisionsIn the United States the Carboniferous is usually broken into Mississippian (earlier) and Pennsylvanian (later) subperiods. The Mississippian is about twice as long as the Pennsylvanian, but due to the large thickness of coal bearing deposits with Pennsylvanian ages in Europe and North America, the two subperiods were long thought to have been more or less equal in duration.In Europe the Lower Carboniferous sub-system is known as the Dinantian, comprising the Tournaisian and Visean Series, dated at 362.5-332.9 Ma, and the Upper Carboniferous sub-system is known as the Silesian, comprising the Namurian, Westphalian, and Stephanian Series, dated at 332.9-290 Ma. The Silesian is roughly contemporaneous with the late Mississippian Serpukhovian plus the Pennsylvanian. In Britain the Dinantian is traditionally known as the Carboniferous Limestone, the Namurian as the Millstone Grit, and the Westphalian as the Coal Measures and Pennant Sandstone.The faunal stages from youngest to oldest, together with some of their subdivisions, are:'''Late Pennsylvanian: Gzhelian (most recent)'''* Noginskian / Virgilian ''(part)'''''Late Pennsylvanian: Kasimovian'''* Klazminskian* Dorogomilovksian / Virgilian ''(part)''* Chamovnicheskian / Cantabrian / Missourian* Krevyakinskian / Cantabrian / Missourian'''Middle Pennsylvanian: Moscovian'''* Myachkovskian / Bolsovian / Desmoinesian* Podolskian / Desmoinesian* Kashirskian / Atokan* Vereiskian / Bolsovian / Atokan'''Early Pennsylvanian: Bashkirian / Morrowan'''* Melekesskian / Duckmantian* Cheremshanskian / Langsettian* Yeadonian* Marsdenian* Kinderscoutian'''Late Mississippian: Serpukhovian'''* Alportian* Chokierian / Chesterian / Elvirian* Arnsbergian / Elvirian* Pendleian'''Middle Mississippian: Viséan|Visean'''* Brigantian / St Genevieve / Gasperian / Chesterian* Asbian / Meramecian* Holkerian / Salem* Arundian / Warsaw / Meramecian* Chadian / Keokuk / Osagean ''(part)'' / Osage ''(part)'''''Early Mississippian: Tournaisian (oldest)'''* Ivorian / ''(part)'' / Osage ''(part)''* Hastarian / Kinderhookian / ChouteauPalaeogeographyA global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian reversed early in the Carboniferous; this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the Mississippian. There was also a drop in south polar temperatures; southern Gondwanaland was glaciated throughout the period, though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not."ReferenceA"These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics, where lush coal swamps flourished within 30 degrees of the northernmost glaciers."ReferenceA"File:US pennsylvanian general.jpg|thumb|270px|left|Generalized geographic map of the United States in Middle Pennsylvanian time.A mid-Carboniferous drop in sea level precipitated a major marine extinction, one that hit crinoids and ammonites especially hard."ReferenceA"This sea level drop and the associated unconformity in North America separate the Mississippian subperiod from the Pennsylvanian subperiod."ReferenceA"This happened about 318 million years ago, at the onset of the Permo-Carboniferous Glaciation.The Carboniferous was a time of active mountain-building, as the supercontinent Pangaea came together. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana, which collided with North America–Europe (Laurussia) along the present line of eastern North America. This continental collision resulted in the Hercynian orogeny in Europe, and the Alleghenian orogeny in North America; it also extended the newly uplifted Appalachians southwestward as the Ouachita Mountains."ReferenceA"In the same time frame, much of present eastern Eurasian plate welded itself to Europe along the line of the Ural mountains. Most of the Mesozoic supercontinent of Pangea was now assembled, although North China (which would collide in the Latest Carboniferous), and South China continents were still separated from Laurasia. The Late Carboniferous Pangaea was shaped like an "O."There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous—Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys, which was inside the "O" in the Carboniferous Pangaea. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed - Rheic Ocean (closed by the assembly of South and North America), the small, shallow Ural Ocean (which was closed by the collision of Baltica and Siberia continents, creating the Ural Mountains) and Proto-Tethys Ocean (closed by North China collision with Siberia/Kazakhstania).Climate and weatherAverage global temperatures in the Early Carboniferous Period were high: approximately 20°C (68°F). However, cooling during the Middle Carboniferous reduced average global temperatures to about 12°C (54°F). Glaciations in Gondwana, triggered by Gondwana's southward movement, continued into the Permian and because of the lack of clear markers and breaks, the deposits of this glacial period are often referred to as Permo-Carboniferous in age.The thicker atmosphere and stronger coriolis effect due to Earth's faster rotation (a day lasted for 22.4 hours in early Carboniferous) created significantly stronger winds than today.The cooling and drying of the climate led to the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse (CRC). Tropical rainforests fragmented and then were eventually devastated by climate change."SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"[Climate and the Carboniferous Period]Rocks and coalright|Lower Carboniferous marble in Big Cottonwood Canyon, Wasatch Mountains, Utah.Carboniferous rocks in Europe and eastern North America largely consist of a repeated sequence of limestone, sandstone, shale and coal beds. In North America, the early Carboniferous is largely marine limestone, which accounts for the division of the Carboniferous into two periods in North American schemes. The Carboniferous coal beds provided much of the fuel for power generation during the Industrial Revolution and are still of great economic importance.The large coal deposits of the Carboniferous may owe their existence primarily to two factors. The first of these is the appearance of wood tissue and bark-bearing trees. The evolution of the wood fiber lignin and the bark-sealing, waxy substance suberin variously opposed decay organisms so effectively that dead materials accumulated long enough to fossilise on a large scale. The second factor was the lower sea levels that occurred during the Carboniferous as compared to the preceding Devonian period. This promoted the development of extensive lowland swamps and forests in North America and Europe. Based on a genetic analysis of mushroom fungi, David Hibbett and colleagues proposed that large quantities of wood were buried during this period because animals and decomposing bacteria had not yet evolved enzymes that could effectively digest the resistant phenolic lignin polymers and waxy suberin polymers. They suggest that fungi that could break those substances down effectively only became dominant towards the end of the period, making subsequent coal formation much rarer.The Carboniferous trees made extensive use of lignin. They had bark to wood ratios of 8 to 1, and even as high as 20 to 1. This compares to modern values less than 1 to 4. This bark, which must have been used as support as well as protection, probably had 38% to 58% lignin. Lignin is insoluble, too large to pass through cell walls, too heterogeneous for specific enzymes, and toxic, so that few organisms other than Basidiomycetes fungi can degrade it. To oxidize it requires an atmosphere of greater than 5% oxygen, or compounds such as peroxides. It can linger in soil for thousands of years and its toxic breakdown products inhibit decay of other substances.Robinson, JM. 1990 Lignin, land plants, and fungi: Biological evolution affecting Phanerozoic oxygen balance. Geology 18; 607–610, on p608. Probably the reason for its high percentages is protection from insect herbivory in a world containing very effective insect herbivores, but nothing remotely as effective as modern insectivores and probably many fewer poisons than currently. In any case coal measures could easily have made thick deposits on well drained soils as well as swamps. The extensive burial of biologically produced carbon led to an increase in oxygen levels in the atmosphere; estimates place the peak oxygen content as high as 35%, compared to 21% today.This oxygen level may have increased wildfire activity. It also may have promoted gigantism of insects and amphibians — creatures that have been constrained in size by respiratory systems that are limited in their physiological ability to transport and distribute oxygen at the lower atmospheric concentrations that have since been available.In eastern North America, marine beds are more common in the older part of the period than the later part and are almost entirely absent by the late Carboniferous. More diverse geology existed elsewhere, of course. Marine life is especially rich in crinoids and other echinoderms. Brachiopods were abundant. Trilobites became quite uncommon. On land, large and diverse plant populations existed. Land vertebrates included large amphibians.LifePlantsEtching depicting some of the most significant plants of the Carboniferous.Coal PlantsEarly Carboniferous land plants, some of which were preserved in coal balls, were very similar to those of the preceding Late Devonian, but new groups also appeared at this time.Ancient ''in situ'' lycopsid, probably ''Sigillaria'', with attached stigmarian roots.Base of a lycopsid showing connection with bifurcating stigmarian roots.The main Early Carboniferous plants were the Equisetales (horse-tails), Sphenophyllales (scrambling plants), Lycopodiales (club mosses), Lepidodendrales (scale trees), Filicales (ferns), Medullosales (informally included in the "seed ferns", an artificial assemblage of a number of early gymnosperm groups) and the Cordaitales. These continued to dominate throughout the period, but during late Carboniferous, several other groups, Cycadophyta (cycads), the Callistophytales (another group of "seed ferns"), and the Voltziales (related to and sometimes included under the conifers), appeared.The Carboniferous lycophytes of the order Lepidodendrales, which are cousins (but not ancestors) of the tiny club-moss of today, were huge trees with trunks 30 meters high and up to 1.5 meters in diameter. These included ''Lepidodendron'' (with its cone called Lepidostrobus), ''Anabathra'', ''Lepidophloios'' and ''Sigillaria''. The roots of several of these forms are known as Stigmaria. Unlike present day trees, their secondary growth took place in the cortex, which also provided stability, instead of the xylem. The Cladoxylopsids were large trees, that were ancestors of ferns, first arising in the Carboniferous.C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [''Fern''. Encyclopedia of Earth. National council for Science and the Environment]. Washington, DCThe fronds of some Carboniferous ferns are almost identical with those of living species. Probably many species were epiphytic. Fossil ferns and "seed ferns" include ''Pecopteris'', ''Cyclopteris'', ''Neuropteris'', ''Alethopteris'', and ''Sphenopteris''; ''Megaphyton'' and ''Caulopteris'' were tree ferns.The Equisetales included the common giant form ''Calamites'', with a trunk diameter of 30 to  and a height of up to . ''Sphenophyllum'' was a slender climbing plant with whorls of leaves, which was probably related both to the calamites and the lycopods.''Cordaites'', a tall plant (6 to over 30 meters) with strap-like leaves, was related to the cycads and conifers; the catkin-like reproductive organs, which bore ovules/seeds, is called ''Cardiocarpus''. These plants were thought to live in swamps and mangroves. True coniferous trees (''Walchia'', of the order Voltziales) appear later in the Carboniferous, and preferred higher drier ground.Marine invertebratesIn the oceans the most important marine invertebrate groups are the Foraminifera, corals, Bryozoa, Ostracoda, brachiopods, ammonoids, hederelloids, microconchids and echinoderms (especially crinoids). For the first time foraminifera take a prominent part in the marine faunas. The large spindle-shaped genus ''Fusulina'' and its relatives were abundant in what is now Russia, China, Japan, North America; other important genera include ''Valvulina'', ''Endothyra'', ''Archaediscus'', and ''Saccammina'' (the latter common in Britain and Belgium). Some Carboniferous genera are still extant.The microscopic shells of radiolarians are found in cherts of this age in the Culm of Devon and Cornwall, and in Russia, Germany and elsewhere. Sponges are known from spicules and anchor ropes, and include various forms such as the Calcispongea ''Cotyliscus'' and ''Girtycoelia'', the demosponge ''Chaetetes'', and the genus of unusual colonial glass sponges ''Titusvillia''.Both reef-building and solitary corals diversify and flourish; these include both rugose (for example, ''Caninia'', ''Corwenia'', ''Neozaphrentis''), heterocorals, and tabulate (for example, ''Chladochonus'', ''Michelinia'') forms. Conularids were well represented by ''Conularia''Bryozoa are abundant in some regions; the fenestellids including ''Fenestella'', ''Polypora'', and ''Archimedes'', so named because it is in the shape of an Archimedean screw. Brachiopods are also abundant; they include productids, some of which (for example, ''Gigantoproductus'') reached very large (for brachiopods) size and had very thick shells, while others like ''Chonetes'' were more conservative in form. Athyridids, spiriferids, rhynchonellids, and terebratulids are also very common. Inarticulate forms include ''Discina'' and ''Crania''. Some species and genera had a very wide distribution with only minor variations.Annelids such as ''Serpulites'' are common fossils in some horizons. Among the mollusca, the bivalves continue to increase in numbers and importance. Typical genera include ''Aviculopecten'', ''Posidonomya'', ''Nucula'', ''Carbonicola'', ''Edmondia'', and ''Modiola'' Gastropods are also numerous, including the genera ''Murchisonia'', ''Euomphalus'', ''Naticopsis''. Nautiloid cephalopods are represented by tightly coiled nautilids, with straight-shelled and curved-shelled forms becoming increasingly rare. Goniatite ammonoids are common.Trilobites are rarer than in previous periods, on a steady trend towards extinction, represented only by the proetid group. Ostracoda, a class of crustaceans, were abundant as representatives of the meiobenthos; genera included ''Amphissites'', ''Bairdia'', ''Beyrichiopsis'', ''Cavellina'', ''Coryellina'', ''Cribroconcha'', ''Hollinella'', ''Kirkbya'', ''Knoxiella'', and ''Libumella''.Amongst the echinoderms, the crinoids were the most numerous. Dense submarine thickets of long-stemmed crinoids appear to have flourished in shallow seas, and their remains were consolidated into thick beds of rock. Prominent genera include ''Cyathocrinus'', ''Woodocrinus'', and ''Actinocrinus''. Echinoids such as ''Archaeocidaris'' and ''Palaeechinus'' were also present. The blastoids, which included the Pentreinitidae and Codasteridae and superficially resembled crinoids in the possession of long stalks attached to the seabed, attain their maximum development at this time.Image:Aviculopecten subcardiformis01.JPG|''Aviculopecten subcardiformis''; a bivalve from the Logan Formation (Lower Carboniferous) of Wooster, Ohio (external mold).Image:LoganFauna011312.jpg|Bivalves (''Aviculopecten'') and brachiopods (''Syringothyris'') in the Logan Formation (Lower Carboniferous) in Wooster, Ohio.Image:Syringothyris01.JPG|''Syringothyris'' sp.; a spiriferid brachiopod from the Logan Formation (Lower Carboniferous) of Wooster, Ohio (internal mold).Image:Palaeophycus01.JPG|''Palaeophycus'' ichnosp.; a trace fossil from the Logan Formation (Lower Carboniferous) of Wooster, Ohio.Image:PlatyceratidMississippian.JPG|Crinoid calyx from the Lower Carboniferous of Ohio with a conical platyceratid gastropod (''Palaeocapulus acutirostre'') attached.Image:Conulariid03.jpg|Conulariid from the Lower Carboniferous of Indiana.Image:Syringoporid.jpg|Tabulate coral (a syringoporid); Boone Limestone (Lower Carboniferous) near Hiwasse, Arkansas.;/center;Freshwater and lagoonal invertebratesFreshwater Carboniferous invertebrates include various bivalve molluscs that lived in brackish or fresh water, such as ''Anthraconaia'', ''Naiadites'', and ''Carbonicola''; diverse crustaceans such as ''Candona'', ''Carbonita'', ''Darwinula'', ''Estheria'', ''Acanthocaris'', ''Dithyrocaris'', and ''Anthrapalaemon''.File:Megarachne BW.jpg|thumb|The upper Carboniferous giant spider-like eurypterid ''Megarachne'' grew to legspans of .The Eurypterids were also diverse, and are represented by such genera as   ''Anthraconectes'', ''Megarachne'' (originally misinterpreted as a giant spider, hence its name) and the specialised very large ''Hibbertopterus''. Many of these were amphibious.Frequently a temporary return of marine conditions resulted in marine or brackish water genera such as ''Lingula'', Orbiculoidea, and ''Productus'' being found in the thin beds known as marine bands.Terrestrial invertebratesFossil remains of air-breathing insects, myriapods and arachnids are known from the late Carboniferous, but so far not from the early Carboniferous."Garwood"The first true priapulids appeared during this period. Their diversity when they do appear, however, shows that these arthropods were both well developed and numerous. Their large size can be attributed to the moistness of the environment (mostly swampy fern forests) and the fact that the oxygen concentration in the Earth's atmosphere in the Carboniferous was much higher than today.This required less effort for respiration and allowed arthropods to grow larger with the up to 2.6 metres long millipede-like ''Arthropleura'' being the largest known land invertebrate of all time. Among the insect groups are the huge predatory Protodonata (griffinflies), among which was ''Meganeura'', a giant dragonfly-like insect and with a wingspan of ca.  — the largest flying insect ever to roam the planet. Further groups are the Syntonopterodea (relatives of present-day mayflies), the abundant and often large sap-sucking Palaeodictyopteroidea, the diverse herbivorous Protorthoptera, and numerous basal Dictyoptera (ancestors of cockroaches)."Archi"Many insects have been obtained from the coalfields of Saarbrücken and Commentry, and from the hollow trunks of fossil trees in Nova Scotia. Some British coalfields have yielded good specimens: ''Archaeoptitus'', from the Derbyshire coalfield, had a spread of wing extending to more than 35cm; some specimens (''Brodia'') still exhibit traces of brilliant wing colors. In the Nova Scotian tree trunks land snails (''Archaeozonites'', ''Dendropupa'') have been found.File:Meganeura.jpg|The late Carboniferous giant dragonfly-like insect ''Meganeura'' grew to wingspans of .File:Pulmonoscopius BW.jpg|The gigantic ''Pulmonoscorpius'' from the early Carboniferous reached a length of up to .|''Arthropleura'', the largest land arthropod of all time.;/center;FishMany fish inhabited the Carboniferous seas; predominantly Elasmobranchs (sharks and their relatives). These included some, like ''Psammodus'', with crushing pavement-like teeth adapted for grinding the shells of brachiopods, crustaceans, and other marine organisms. Other sharks had piercing teeth, such as the Symmoriida; some, the petalodonts, had peculiar cycloid cutting teeth. Most of the sharks were marine, but the Xenacanthida invaded fresh waters of the coal swamps. Among the bony fish, the Palaeonisciformes found in coastal waters also appear to have migrated to rivers. Sarcopterygian fish were also prominent, and one group, the Rhizodonts, reached very large size.Most species of Carboniferous marine fish have been described largely from teeth, fin spines and dermal ossicles, with smaller freshwater fish preserved whole.Freshwater fish were abundant, and include the genera ''Ctenodus'', ''Uronemus'', ''Acanthodes'', ''Cheirodus'', and ''Gyracanthus''.Sharks (especially the ''Stethacanthids'') underwent a major evolutionary radiation during the Carboniferous.goldsharksIt is believed that this evolutionary radiation occurred because the decline of the placoderms at the end of the Devonian period caused many environmental niches to become unoccupied and allowed new organisms to evolve and fill these niches.goldsharksAs a result of the evolutionary radiation carboniferous sharks assumed a wide variety of bizarre shapes including ''Stethacanthus'' which possessed a flat brush-like dorsal fin with a patch of denticles on its top.goldsharks''Stethacanthus''' unusual fin may have been used in mating rituals.File:Stethacanthus BW.jpg|''Akmonistion'' of the shark order Symmoriida roamed the oceans of the early Carboniferous.File:Falcatus.jpg|''Falcatus'' was a Carboniferous shark, with a high degree of sexual dimorphism.;/center;TetrapodsCarboniferous amphibians were diverse and common by the middle of the period, more so than they are today; some were as long as 6 meters, and those fully terrestrial as adults had scaly skin. They included a number of basal tetrapod groups classified in early books under the Labyrinthodontia. These had long bodies, a head covered with bony plates and generally weak or undeveloped limbs. The largest were over 2 meters long. They were accompanied by an assemblage of smaller amphibians included under the Lepospondyli, often only about  long. Some Carboniferous amphibians were aquatic and lived in rivers (''Loxomma'', ''Eogyrinus'', ''Proterogyrinus''); others may have been semi-aquatic (''Ophiderpeton'', ''Amphibamus'', ''Hyloplesion'') or terrestrial (''Dendrerpeton'', ''Tuditanus'', ''Anthracosaurus'').The Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse slowed the evolution of amphibians who could not survive as well in the cooler, drier conditions. Reptiles, however prospered due to specific key adaptations."SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"One of the greatest evolutionary innovations of the Carboniferous was the amniote egg, which allowed for the further exploitation of the land by certain tetrapods. These included the earliest sauropsid reptiles (''Hylonomus''), and the earliest known synapsid (''Archaeothyris''). These small lizard-like animals quickly gave rise to many descendants. The amniote egg allowed these ancestors of all later birds, mammals, and reptiles to reproduce on land by preventing the desiccation, or drying-out, of the embryo inside.Reptiles underwent a major evolutionary radiation in response to the drier climate that preceded the rainforest collapse."SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"M. Alan Kazlev (1998) [The Carboniferous Period of the Paleozoic Era: 299 to 359 million years ago], Palaeos.org, Retrieved on 2008-06-23 By the end of the Carboniferous period, amniotes had already diversified into a number of groups, including protorothyridids, captorhinids, araeoscelids, and several families of pelycosaurs.Image:Pederpes22small.jpg|The amphibian-like ''Pederpes'', the most primitive Mississippian tetrapodImage:Hylonomus BW.jpg|''Hylonomus'', the earliest sauropsid reptile, appeared in the Pennsylvanian.Image:Petrolacosaurus BW.jpg|''Petrolacosaurus'', the first diapsid reptile known, lived during the late Carboniferous.Image:Archaeothyris BW.jpg|''Archaeothyris'' was a very early mammal-like reptile and is the oldest undisputed synapsid known.;/center;FungiBecause plants and animals were growing in size and abundance in this time (for example, ''Lepidodendron''), land fungi diversified further. Marine fungi still occupied the oceans. All modern classes of fungi were present in the Late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian Epoch).Extinction eventsRomer's gapRomer's gapThe first 15 million years of the Carboniferous had very limited terrestrial fossils. This gap in the fossil record is called Romer's gap after the American palaentologist Alfred Romer. While it has long been debated whether the gap is a result of fossilisation or relates to an actual event, recent work indicates the gap period saw a drop in atmospheric oxygen levels, indicating some sort of ecological collapse.Ward, P. et al. (2006): Confirmation of Romer's Gap is a low oxygen interval constraining the timing of initial arthropod and vertebrate terrestrialization. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' no 103 (45): pp 16818-16822. The gap saw the demise of the Devonian fish-like ichthyostegalian labyrinthodonts, and the rise of the more advanced temnospondyl and reptiliomorphan amphibians that so typify the Carboniferous terrestrial vertebrate fauna.Carboniferous rainforest collapseCarboniferous Rainforest CollapseBefore the end of the Carboniferous Period, an extinction event occurred. On land this event is referred to as the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse (CRC)."SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"Vast tropical rainforests collapsed suddenly as the climate changed from hot and humid to cool and arid. This was likely caused by intense glaciation and a drop in sea levels.The new climatic conditions were not favorable to the growth of rainforest and the animals within them. Rainforests shrank into isolated islands, surrounded by seasonally dry habitats. Towering lycopsid forests with a heterogeneous mixture of vegetation were replaced by much less diverse tree-fern dominated flora.Amphibians, the dominant vertebrates at the time, fared poorly through this event with large losses in biodiversity; reptiles continued to diversify due to key adaptations that let them survive in the drier habitat, specifically the hard-shelled egg and scales, both of which retain water better than their amphibian counterparts."SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"See also* Carboniferous tetrapods* Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse* Important Carboniferous Lagerstätten** East Kirkton Quarry; c. 350 mya; Bathgate, Scotland** Hamilton Quarry; 320 mya; Kansas, US** Mazon Creek; 300 mya; Illinois, US* List of fossil sites ''(with link directory)''References2Sources****External linksPaleozoic#CarboniferousCarboniferous**p.05
