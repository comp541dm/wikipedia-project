Shouldn't this article be titled "Boolean and"?:The distinction I'd like to make is that boolean operations work with truth values. Binary operations can work with single digits (which are equivalent to truth values) but also on binary numbers comprised of more bits. --Robbe::When the operation is done on binary numbers (;1), that's called Bitwise AND, isn't it? Torzsmokus 13:40, 3 January 2007 (UTC)Merge with Logical conjunctionThere is no article for Binary OR; the OR redirects to Logical disjunction.  The Binary AND is just an implementation of Logical conjunction in the numbers 0 and 1.  I do not see how having a separate page for a Binary AND is necessary.  It should just be a section in Logical conjunction.  What more can be added about Binary AND that does not actually belong in Logical conjunction?
