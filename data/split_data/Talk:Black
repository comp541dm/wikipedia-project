Thoughts? Coeco (talk) 13:48, 22 April 2013 (UTC)This article is largely about the history and cultural associations and  uses of black, and in all of those black is certainly considered a color.  In Webster's new world dictionary it's called "the darkest color".  It may not be considered a true color in optics, but in other fields it certainly is.SiefkinDR (talk) 15:56, 22 April 2013 (UTC): Check Archive 1.  You'll see a lengthy discussion was already had on the topic of black being a colour.: Some incorrectly believe that all colours are shades but that not all shades are colours, that black is an example of a shade that is not also a colour.  In reality, all hues are colours while not all colours are hues—black is a prime example of a colour that is not also a hue.: If one holds up a black crayon and asks, "What colour is this," none would respond, "That crayon does not have a colour"; instead, people would simply say "black."  Although transparent/invisible is not a colour, a black crayon is visible and opaque, and all opaque objects possess a colour, regardless of whether they possess a hue.: The following chart was designed in January of 2010::: In short, we oughtn't say, "Black is not a colour; it is a shade." Rather, we ought to say, "Black is not a hue; it is a colour.": Cheers,: allixpeeke (talk) 19:42, 31 May 2013 (UTC)Race and ColorIn this section, it refers to the 2012 US census. Is this correct? I thought they do it only in years ending in zero, every 10 years, 1990, 2000, 2010.Zdawg1029 (talk) 21:14, 24 October 2013 (UTC)Parallel universes and Gutenberg's navy blue inkI removed the paragraph starting "Obtaining a good quality black was an essential element of the most influential invention of the Middle Ages; the printing press." and the associated picture, File:Gutenberg bible Old Testament Epistle of St Jerome.jpg. There are no references given for this assertion, and it seems to me that the colour black per se is not essential to the influential development of the printing press and higher quality, smudge-resistant ink. In a parallel universe, navy blue might just as well have done the trick. Willondon (talk) 18:36, 27 August 2015 (UTC)::You make an interesting point, and I will correct the text and make it more clear, and am adding a reference on the topic.  Black was chosen for handwriting and printing for the simple reason that, as the darkest color, it makes the greatest contrast with white paper or parchment, and is the easiest color to read.  For the same reason, it's used for the print on computer screens.  I don't know what color they would use in a parallel universe, since I've never visited one, unless you count Las Vegas.   Best regards,  SiefkinDR (talk) 09:57, 30 August 2015 (UTC):::I imagine a hideous neon green ink. No, let's not count Las Vegas. Willondon (talk) 15:17, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
