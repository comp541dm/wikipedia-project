Rest of the world?I thought that a box cutter is just like a pair of scissors: An office tool that can be purchased by anyone who has enough age to go to a store alone and be considered "normal". Around here, in Chile, at least, it isn't considered "special". The view presented in this article (of the box cutter as a weapon) reflects more or less all the rest of the world? Or just USA and some other countries affected by terrorism? Of course it is used for crime sometimes, but so could be a scissor or a kitchen knife, yet I guess any 14-year old could purchase a scissor, no?--user:guruclef:In the US, anyone can purchase a boxcutter, but their use as weapons hits close to home due to (false, I think) rumors that they were used on the September 11 attacks.  The EU is more cautious; I think even kitchen knives have a minimum age.  It's much sharper than scissors, though, or even kitchen knives, and lends itself much better to use on flesh.  Twin Bird (talk) 05:04, 22 April 2011 (UTC)Use as WeaponsI don't have this from a reliable source, more the notion on the street. Hence I'll put it here, and if someone can find research or statistics on the matter, that'd be great. Among teenagers on the clubbing scene in the UK, carrying a 'Segmented type' Stanley knife as a weapon has a specific purpose. You can extend it to four or five notches, stab someone a couple of times, and leave them for dead. BUT, people on the club scence are carrying knives because they think it's a good way to defend themself. They don't want to stab someone to death. A Stanley knife, on one 'notch', will cause pretty nasty damage, but nothing permanent.In retrospect, this entry (or at least the phrasing) will seem a bit topical, I think. --PinkunicornYes, I think you're right.  I created this because someone wikied the word on the main terrorist attack page, and I thought that might mean that some people might not know what a box cutter knife is.

Some products (Kleenex, Xerox copiers, Weed Eaters) have entered into common parlance, sometimes to the chagrin of the companies that own the marks.  -- ansible:The actual Stanley Knives are of a slightly different design than the plastic-handled knives we are discussing, I think.  An actual stanley knife (or faithful copy) has a different retraction mechanism, and rather than the multi-segment blades designed to be broken off and discarded segment by segment as they fail, stanley knife blades do not have multiple segments, but are simply reversible when one end of the blade gets blunt).  --Robert MerkelNot that it really matters but i have a metal Stanley knife with a mult-segment snap-off blade.

It is a samller device than a box cutter knife, designed for lighter-weight and higher-precision work. See  for more on X-Acto brand products.----No doubt, but in Fredericton, New Brunswick many people use the term "exacto knife" to refer to utility knives.

They are available at most hardware and department stores in Canada. They have two common sizes: a thin one, black enamel metal handle, about the size of a flat pen. I used to use them in the newspaper business for cutting up copy for pasting onto big proof sheets. Handy, since they were relatively safe to use and the blade can be retracted quickly. The other model is larger, often in a yellow plastic handle and fills a closed fist. These are commonly used as box cutters and for cutting carpet, tiles and other materials. Both knives have replaceable blades that snap off. The larger one, with about 1.5 in. of blade exposed would be an intimidating weapon. People inherently fear razor sharp knives like these. Amazing what the New York terrorist attackers did with about $50 in knives. One thing it did, though, is diminish George Bush's interest in the new flavor of Star Wars anti-missile program.

The most famous reference to this kind of knife was its conjectured use as an offensive weapon in some fairly recent hijacking incidents. The phrase used was "box-cutter knife".

Good points about various functional reasons why a jump-link down to the nomenclature section is not ideal in all respects (search, emphasis/weight, etc).

So in light of those considerations, let me modify my comments here to say that whatever y'all want to do here with this lede is fine with me. I would just add a caveat that only the top 2 or 3 "most important" synonyms should occur in the opening sentence, with the "whole long list of other, less common ones" still being handled via a jump-down link to a nomenclature section.

Targets of redirects are bolded to explain to the redirected person why they've got where they've got to, but this is less effective if the term isn't used near the top of the article.

There are no narrow, mutually exclusive classifications handed down from God, like a one true taxonomy or ontology. Many a knife that you could point to, people will call it different names around the anglophone world; and for many a name you might say, it means different things to different listeners around the world. In my opinion hobby knives are a "different thing" than utility knives; but they're both "razor knives", and really, where is the dividing line between the large 1"-DIA-handle hobby knife, which comes in retractable versions, and the utility knife? The etic classification is harder than the emic one. "X-Acto" in my region means a hobby knife, but it means (what we here call a utility knife) in other places. You could play around with reorganizing the content and pagenaming if you want, but I'm not sure there's value in it, because what you're up against isn't inaccuracy but rather natural variations. â€”User:Three-quarter-ten|Â¾-10 21:50, 26 April 2011 (UTC): BTW, another exampleâ€”in my region, boxcutters are a "different thing" from utility knives, but the problem is that in other regions, the name "boxcutter" covers utility knives, too, and the flat cheap knives are apparently not mentally classified as a "different thing" in some places. â€”User:Three-quarter-ten|Â¾-10 21:55, 26 April 2011 (UTC):: Part of the problem is that a history merge brought in a lot of stuff on "box cutters" even though a "dedicated" box cutter is quite different in design to the knives that most of the article discusses.

Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward: not at work) - talk 22:03, 26 April 2011 (UTC)::: I agree completely. Here's a thought not at all fully pondered, but just throwing it out there: One thing that all these knives have in common is that they use removable razor blades (not necessarily literal shaving razor, but that style of blade).

Right now this article is a rambling mess which combines three random sharp pointy things into one subject. It's quite possible that we have other articles on subsets of knives with the same problems.

Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward: not at work) - talk 18:09, 27 April 2011 (UTC):::::: Valid thoughts overall, but I disagree about "ponderous and cumbersome" and "rambling mess" and "random". What's here may not be the best scheme, but it simply reflects the natural problem that occurs in the ontology of a worldwide-scope encyclopedia: You can't create an etic ontology using emic nomenclature, and encyclopedias require emic pagenames (both by unconscious [non-self-aware] convention and to a large extent by pedagogical necessity). The "pedagogical necessity", admittedly, lends some weight to the "cumbersome" observation. But unfortunately what that means is that covering the whole truth and teaching it to other people are not always compatible pursuits, based on the constraints of human cognition. So the content we see here so far is not horrible in the sense of "written by idiots" (I realize that no one here alleged that, but I'm just explicating generally). The problem comes from the universe handing us a double bind type of task. There are no solutions except imperfect ones, and no matter what is done here (reorg, pagenaming, heading wording, cross-ref links), one person will think it's the least of the evils while another person will think it's not the least of them. Human culture would need enforceable retronymy in order to circumvent this problem by renaming whole classes of knives as new variants are invented (just like biological classification, such as binomial nomenclature, occasionally revises existing genus and species names as new species are discovered). But I don't even believe in, ethically speaking, non-voluntary retronymy for natural language. For technical standards and specifications, yes, but not natural language overall.

Most people will find it more absorbable through the emic lens. As for "discrete", that was my (probably failed) attempt to label the blades that come as already-separate pieces, as opposed to the snap-off style, where the blades can be viewed as coming "all attached to one another", that is, nondiscrete.

However, if you have an operation, you 'go under the knife'.The ones with snap-off blades are 'cutters' rather than knives, since it is the point, not the blade, used to cut.Special:Contributions/58.174.35.139|58.174.35.139 (talk) 08:31, 15 June 2015 (UTC): Yes I agree, they are just knives, Utility knife is a modern definition/invention Unibond (talk) 12:11, 15 June 2015 (UTC)
