Along with Beta Aquilae and Gamma Aquilae, it forms the well-known line of stars sometimes referred to as the ''Family of Aquila'' or ''Shaft of Aquila''.Altair is a type-A main sequence star with approximately 1.8 times the mass of the Sun and 11 times its luminosity.monnier07peterson06Altair possesses an extremely rapid rate of rotation; it has a rotational period of approximately 9 hours.peterson06For comparison, the equator of the Sun requires a little more than 25 days for a complete rotation. This rapid rotation forces Altair to be oblate; its equatorial diameter is over 20 percent greater than its polar diameter.monnier07Satellite measurements made in 1999 with the Wide Field Infrared Explorer showed that the brightness of Altair fluctuates slightly, varying by just a few thousandths of a magnitude with several different periods less than 2 hours. As a result, it was identified in 2005 as a Delta Scuti variable star. Its light curve can be approximated by adding together a number of sine waves, with periods that range between 0.8 and 1.5 hours.Altair: The Brightest δ Scuti Star, D. L.

Hanbury Brown and his co-workers at Narrabri Observatory in the 1960s.  They found a diameter of 3milliarcseconds.The stellar interferometer at Narrabri Observatory-II.

Although Hanbury Brown et al. realized that Altair would be rotationally flattened, they had insufficient data to experimentally observe its oblateness.  Altair was later observed to be flattened by infrared interferometric measurements made by the Palomar Testbed Interferometer in 1999 and 2000. This work was published by G. T. van Belle, David R. Ciardi and their co-authors in 2001.pti2001Theory predicts that, owing to Altair's rapid rotation, its surface gravity and effective temperature should be lower at the equator, making the equator less luminous than the poles.  This phenomenon, known as gravity darkening or the von Zeipel effect, was confirmed for Altair by measurements made by the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer in 2001, and analyzed by Ohishi et al. (2004) and Peterson et al. (2006).peterson06Asymmetric Surface Brightness Distribution of Altair Observed with the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer, Naoko Ohishi, Tyler E.

Accessed on line November 25, 2008. In 2006 and 2007, J. D. Monnier and his coworkers produced an image of Altair's surface from 2006 infrared observations made with the MIRC instrument on the CHARA array interferometer; this was the first time the surface of any main-sequence star, apart from the Sun, had been imaged.nsfThe false-color image was published in 2007. The equatorial radius of the star was estimated to be 2.03 solar radii, and the polar radius 1.63 solar radii—a 25% increase of the stellar radius from pole to equator.monnier07Etymology, mythology, and cultureAltair in fictionThe name ''Altair'' has been used since medieval times. It is an abbreviation of the Arabic phrase , ''an-nasr aṭ-ṭā’ir'' ("the flying eagle"). The term '''Al Nesr Al Tair''' appeared in Al Achsasi al Mouakket's catalogue, which  was translated into Latin as '''Vultur Volans'''. This name was applied by the Arabs to the asterism of α, Beta Aquilae|β, and Gamma Aquilae|γ Aquilae and probably goes back to the ancient Babylonians and Sumerians, who called α Aquilae the eagle star.pp. 17–18, ''A Dictionary of Modern Star Names'', Paul Kunitzsch and Tim Smart, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Sky Publishing, 2006, ISBN 978-1-931559-44-7. The spelling ''Atair'' has also been used.p. 59–60, [''Star-names and Their Meanings''], Richard Hinckley Allen, New York: G. E. Stechert, 1899. Medieval astrolabes of England and Western Europe depicted Altair and Vega as birds.The Koori people of Victoria also knew Altair as ''Bunjil'', the wedge-tailed eagle, and β and γ Aquilae are his two wives the black swans. The people of the Murray River knew the star as ''Totyerguil''. The Murray River was formed when ''Totyerguil'' the hunter speared ''Otjout'', a giant Murray cod, who, when wounded, churned a channel across southern Australia before entering the sky as the constellation Delphinus.In Chinese, the asterism consisting of α, Beta Aquilae|β, and Gamma Aquilae|γ Aquilae is known as ''hegu'' (; lit. "river drum").allenAltair is thus known as ''hegu er'' (; lit. "river drum two", meaning the "second star of the drum at the river"). [香港太空館 - 研究資源 - 亮星中英對照表], Hong Kong Space Museum.

These names are an allusion to a love story, ''The Weaver Girl and the Cowherd'', in which Niulang (represented by Altair) and his two children (represented by Beta Aquilae|β and Gamma Aquilae|γ Aquilae) are separated from respectively their wife and mother Zhinu (represented by Vega) by the Milky Way. They are only permitted to meet once a year, when magpies form a bridge to allow them to cross the Milky Way.brownpp. 105–107, ''Magic Lotus Lantern and Other Tales from the Han Chinese'', Haiwang Yuan and Michael Ann Williams, Libraries Unlimited, 2006, ISBN 978-1-59158-294-6.The people of Micronesia called Altair as ''Mai-lapa'', "big/old breadfruit", while the Māori people called this star as ''Poutu-te-rangi'', "pillar of heaven".p. 175, [''The Lexicon of Proto Oceanic: The Culture and Environment of Ancestral Oceanic Society: The Physical Environment, Volume 2''], Malcolm Ross, Andrew Pawley and Meredith Osmond, Canberra, The Australian National University E Press, 2007.In Western astrology, the star Altair was ill-omened, portending danger from reptiles.allenJapan Airlines's Starjet 777-200 JA8983 was named Altair.Altair Airlines was a regional airline that operated out of Philadelphia from 1966 to 1982.The NASA Constellation Program announced ''Altair'' as the name of the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) on December 13, 2007., December 13, 2007, collectspace.com.
