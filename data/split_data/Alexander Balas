Along with his sister Laodice VI, the youngster Alexander was "discovered" by Heracleides, a former minister of Antiochus IV and brother of Timarchus, an usurper in Media who had been executed by the reigning king Demetrius I Soter.Alexander's claims were recognized by the Roman Senate, Ptolemy Philometor of Egypt and others. He married Cleopatra Thea, a daughter of the Ptolemaic dynasty. At first unsuccessful, Alexander finally defeated Demetrius Soter in 150 BC. Being now master of the empire, he is said to have abandoned himself to a life of debauchery. Whatever the truth behind this, the young king was forced to depend heavily on his Ptolemaic support and even struck portraits with the characteristic features of king Ptolemy I.Demetrius Soter's son Demetrius II profited by the opportunity to regain the throne. Ptolemy Philometor, who was Alexander's father-in-law, went over to his side, and Alexander was defeated in the  battle of Antioch (145 BC) in Syria, sometimes known as the battle of the Oenoparus.He fled for refuge to a Nabataean prince, who murdered him and sent his head to Ptolemy Philometor, who had been mortally wounded in the engagement.Further reading*1 Maccabees 10 ff.*Justin xxxv. 1 and 2*Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' ()*Appian, ''Syrian Wars'' (=''Roman History'' book 11), 67*Polybius, ''The Histories'' xxxiii. 14.NotesReferences*External links*[Alexander Balas], article in historical sourcebook by Mahlon H.
