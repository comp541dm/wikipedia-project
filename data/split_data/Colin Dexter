"We were in a little guest house halfway between Caernarfon and Pwllheli. It was a Saturday and it was raining;mdash;it's not unknown for it to rain in North Wales. The children were moaning... I was sitting at the kitchen table with nothing else to do, and I wrote the first few paragraphs of a potential detective novel." Daily Mail, 10 December 2012 ''Last Bus to Woodstock'' was published in 1975 and introduced the character of Inspector Morse, the irascible detective whose penchants for cryptic crosswords, English literature, cask ale, and Wagner reflect Dexter's own enthusiasms. Dexter's plots are notable for his use of false leads and other red herrings.[The Oxford Wine Company - Stars in their bars: Colin Dexter]The success of the 33 episodes of the TV series ''Inspector Morse'', produced between 1987 and 2001, brought further acclaim for Dexter.
