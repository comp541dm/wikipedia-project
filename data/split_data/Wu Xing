Diagram of the interactions between the Wu Xing. The "generative" cycle is illustrated by grey arrows running clockwise on the outside of the circle, while the "destructive" or "conquering" cycle is represented by red arrows inside the circle.The '''Wu Xing''' (), also known as the '''Five Elements''', '''Five Phases''', the '''Five Agents''', the '''Five Movements''', '''Five Processes''', the '''Five Steps/Stages''' and the '''Five Planets'''Dr Zai, J. . Ultravisum, 2015. is a fivefold conceptual scheme that many traditional Chinese fields used to explain a wide array of phenomena, from cosmic cycles to the interaction between internal organs, and from the succession of political regimes to the properties of medicinal drugs. The "Five Phases" are Wood (wiktionary:木|木 ''mù''), Fire (wiktionary:火|火 ''huǒ''), Earth (wiktionary:土|土 ''tǔ''), Metal (wiktionary:金|金 ''jīn''), and Water (wiktionary:水|水 ''shuǐ''). This order of presentation is known as the "mutual generation" (相生 ''xiāngshēng'') sequence. In the order of "mutual overcoming" (相克 ''xiāngkè''), they are Wood, Earth, Water, Fire, and Metal.Deng Yu et al; Fresh Translator of Zang Xiang Fractal five System，Chinese Journal of Integrative Medicine; 1999Deng Yu et al，TCM Fractal Sets中医分形集，Journal of Mathematical Medicine ，1999，12（3），264-265The system of five phases was used for describing interactions and relationships between phenomena. After it came to maturity in the second or first century BCE during the Han dynasty, this device was employed in many fields of early Chinese thought, including seemingly disparate fields such as geomancy or Feng shui, astrology, traditional Chinese medicine, music, military strategy and martial arts. The system is still used as a reference in some forms of complementary and alternative medicine and martial arts.Relationship{| class="wikitable"|-! ''Wu Xing'' !! Earth !! Metal !! Water !! Wood !!

Wu Xing () originally refers to the five major planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Venus, Mars) that create five dimensions of earth life."Zai 2015""Wu Xing" is also widely translated as '''Five Elements''' and this is used extensively by many including practitioners of Five Element acupuncture. This translation arose by false analogy with the Western system of the four elements.Nathan Sivin (1995), "Science and Medicine in Chinese History," in his ''Science in Ancient China'' (Aldershot, England: Variorum), text VI, p. 179. Whereas the classical Greek elements were concerned with substances or natural qualities, the Chinese ''xíng'' are "primarily concerned with process and change," hence the common translation as "phases" or "agents."Nathan Sivin (1987), ''Traditional Medicine in Contemporary China'' (Ann Arbor: Center for Chinese Studies, The University of Michigan) p. 73. By the same token, ''Mù'' is thought of as "Tree" rather than "Wood". The word 'element' is thus used within the context of Chinese medicine with a different meaning to its usual meaning.It should be recognized that the word ''phase'', although commonly preferred, is not perfect. ''Phase'' is a better translation for the five ''seasons'' (五運 Wǔ Yùn) mentioned below, and so ''agents'' or ''processes'' might be preferred for the primary term ''xíng''. Manfred Porkert attempts to resolve this by using ''Evolutive Phase'' for 五行 ''Wǔ Xíng'' and ''Circuit Phase'' for 五運 ''Wǔ Yùn'', but these terms are unwieldy.Some of the Mawangdui Silk Texts (no later than 168 BC) also present the Wu Xing as "five virtues" or types of activities.Nathan Sivin (1987), ''Traditional Medicine in Contemporary China'', p. 72. Within Chinese medicine texts the Wu Xing are also referred to as Wu Yun (五運 wǔ yùn) or a combination of the two characters (Wu Xing-Yun) these emphasise the correspondence of five elements to five 'seasons' (four seasons plus one). Another tradition refers to the ''Wǔ Xíng'' as ''Wǔ Dé'' (五德), the Five Virtues (:zh:五德終始說).There is possibly an equivalence of the states of matter found in western physics as follows:* Metal: metallic / crystalline solid with strong chemical bonds ; radiation-conductive vacuum-like inter-atomic voids* Water: ionic/solvent liquid phase* Wood: complex organised living composite material with enzyme catalysis* Fire: energised gas-plasma* Earth: disorganised semi-living composite solid material with microbial culture*The PhasesThe five phases are usually used to describe the state in nature:*Wood/Spring=(72 days) a period of growth, which generates abundant wood and vitality*Fire/Summer=(72 days) a period of swelling, flowering, brimming with fire and energy*Earth=(72 days=4x18days (4 transitional seasons x 18days each) the in-between transitional seasonal periods, or a separate 'season' known as Late Summer or Long Summer - in the latter case associated with leveling and dampening (moderation) and fruition*Metal/Autumn=(72 days) a period of harvesting and collecting*Water/Winter=(72 days) a period of retreat, where stillness and storage pervadesCyclesThe doctrine of five phases describes two cycles, a generating or creation (生, ''shēng'') cycle, also known as "mother-son", and an overcoming or destruction (剋/克, ''kè'') cycle, also known as "grandfather-nephew", of interactions between the phases. Within Chinese medicine the effects of these two main relations are further elaborated:*Inter-promoting (mother/son)*Inter-acting (grandmother/grandson)*Over-acting (''kè'' cycle)*Counter-acting (reverse ''kè'')GeneratingThe common memory jogs, which help to remind in what order the phases are:*Wood feeds Fire*Fire creates Earth (ash)*Earth bears Metal*Metal enriches Water (as in water with minerals is more beneficial to the body than pure water)*Water nourishes WoodOther common words for this cycle include "begets", "engenders" and "mothers".Overcoming*Wood parts Earth (such as roots; or, Trees can prevent soil erosion)*Earth dams (or muddles or absorbs) Water*Water extinguishes Fire*Fire melts Metal*Metal chops WoodThis cycle might also be called "controls", "restrains" or "fathers".Cosmology and ''feng shui''Another illustration of the cycle.Feng shuiAccording to Wu Xing theory, the structure of the cosmos mirrors the five phases. Each phase has a complex series of associations with different aspects of nature, as can be seen in the following table. In the ancient Chinese form of geomancy known as Feng Shui practitioners all based their art and system on the five phases (Wu Xing). All of these phases are represented within the Bagua.  Associated with these phases are colors, seasons and shapes; all of which are interacting with each other.[Chinese Five Elements Chart] Information on the Chinese Five Elements from Northern Shaolin Academy in Microsoft Excel 2003 FormatBased on a particular directional energy flow from one phase to the next, the interaction can be expansive, destructive, or exhaustive.  A proper knowledge of each aspect of energy flow will enable the Feng Shui practitioner to apply certain cures or rearrangement of energy in a way they believe to be beneficial for the receiver of the Feng Shui Treatment.{| class="wikitable"|-!

In this case, the "mother" is weak, and cannot support the child.However, the Kidneys control the Heart along the Kè cycle, so the Kidneys are claimed to restrain the Heart.The citation order of the Five Phases, i.e., the order in which they are cited in the ''Bo hu tong'' 白虎通 and other Han dynasty texts, is Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth.The organs are most effectively treated, according to theory, in the following 4-hour(2h-Yin + 2h-Yang) periods throughout the day, beginning with the 3 a.m. to 7 a. m. period:Metal organs= Lung[Yin]  3am-5am  /\  Large intestine[Yang]  5am-7amEarth organs= Stomach[Yang]  7am-9am /\ Spleen[Yin]  9am-11amFire1 organs= Heart[Yin]  11am-1pm /\ Small Intestine[Yang]  1pm-3pmWater organs= Bladder[Yang]  3pm-5pm /\ Kidney[Yin]  5pm-7pmFire2=Ministerial Fire=Lifegate Fire (the "non-empirical" Pericardium and Triple Burner organs)= Pericard[Yin] 7pm-9pm /\ Triple Burner[Yang]  9pm-11pmWood organs which is the reverse of the citation order (plus an extra use of Fire and the non-empirical organs to take care of the sixth four-hour period of the day) = Gallbladder[Yang]  11pm-1am  /\ Liver[Yin]  1am-3amThese two orders are further related to the sequence of the planets going outward from the sun (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, or Water, Metal, Fire, Wood, and Earth) by a star diagram similar to the one shown above.See .The sequence of the five elements (Traditional Chinese medicine)： promotion, inhibition, Wu (insult).{| class="wikitable"|-!

The perennial tea ceremony ("perennial", literally means four steps or sequences that are linked together, each representing a season of the year) includes four tea settings (茶席) and a tea master (司茶). The tea settings are:*earth, (Incense), yellow, center, up and down*wood,  春風 (Spring Wind), green, east*fire,  夏露 (Summer Dew), red, south*metal, 秋籟 (Fall Sounds), white, west*water, 冬陽 (Winter Sunshine) black/blue, northEach tea setting is arranged and stands for the four directions (north, south, east, and west). A vase of the seasons' flowers is put on tea table. Sometimes if four tea masters are included then five chairs are arranged per tea setting, making a total of twenty plus the 4 tea masters equalling 24, which symbolizes the 24 solar terms of the Chinese calendar, and represents that nature continues or is perennial.See alsoFile:VM Mu-Huo-Tu-Jin-Shui zhi Shen 4594.jpg|thumb|Tablet, in Chinese and Manchu, for the gods of the five elements in the Temple of Heaven.
