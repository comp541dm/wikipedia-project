The '''geography of the Czech Republic''' is quite varied. Bohemia, at the west part of Czech Republic, consists of a river basin, drained by the Elbe (Czech: ''Labe'') and Vltava rivers. It is surrounded by mostly low mountains such as the Sudetes with its part Krkonoše, containing the highest point in the country, the Sněžka-Śnieżka|Sněžka at 0. Moravia, the eastern part, is also quite hilly and is drained predominantly by the Morava river, but also contains the source of the Oder (Czech: ''Odra'') river. Water from the landlocked Czech Republic flows to three different seas: the North Sea, Baltic Sea and Black Sea. The Czech Republic also possesses Moldauhafen, a  enclave in the middle of Hamburg docks, which was awarded to Czechoslovakia by Article 363 of the Treaty of Versailles to allow the landlocked country a place where goods transported downriver could be transferred to seagoing ships; this territory reverts to Germany in 2028.'''Location:'''Central Europe, southeast of GermanyFile:Czech Republic map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Czech Republic map of Köppen climate classification.Map of the Czech RepublicSatellite image of the Czech Republic'''Geographic coordinates:''''''Map references:'''Europe'''Area:'''* ''total:'' km2* ''land:'' km2* ''water:'' km2'''Area - comparative:'''slightly smaller than South Carolina; slightly larger than Scotland'''Land boundaries:'''* ''total:'' 0* ''border countries:'' Austria 0, Germany 0, Poland 0, Slovakia 0'''Panhandles:'''Aš Hook, Šluknov Hook, Frýdlant Hook, Broumov Hook, Javorník Hook, Osoblažsko|Osoblaha Hook, Břeclav Hook (''March-Thaya Triangle'').'''Coastline:''' 0km (landlocked)'''Maritime claims:''' none (landlocked)'''Climate:''' temperate; hot summers; cold, cloudy, humid winters'''Terrain:'''Bohemia in the west consists of rolling plains, hills, and plateaus surrounded by low mountains; Moravia in the east consists of very hilly country'''Elevation extremes:'''* ''lowest point:'' Elbe River - 0* ''highest point:'' Sněžka - 0'''Natural resources:''' hard coal, soft coal, kaolin, clay, graphite, timber, uranium'''Land use:'''* ''arable land:'' 40.88%* ''permanent crops:'' 0.98%* ''other:'' 58.14% (2012 est.)'''Irrigated land:'''  (2007)'''Total renewable water resources:''' 0 (2011)'''Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):'''* ''total:'' 1.7 km3/yr (41%/56%/2%)* ''per capita:'' 164.7 m3/yr (2009)'''Natural hazards:''' flooding'''Environment - international agreements:'''* ''party to:'' Air Pollution, Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides, Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Air Pollution-Sulfur 85, Air Pollution-Sulfur 94, Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds, Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands, Whaling* ''signed, but not ratified:'' none'''Geography - note:''' landlocked; strategically located astride some of oldest and most significant land routes in Europe; Moravian Gate is a traditional military corridor between the North European Plain and the Danube in central EuropeSee also* Czech RepublicReferences;;pt:República Checa#Geografia
