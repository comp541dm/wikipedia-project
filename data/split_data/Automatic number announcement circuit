An '''automatic number announcement circuit''' ('''ANAC''') is a component of a central office of a telephone company that provides a service to installation and service technicians to determine the telephone number of a line. The facility has a telephone number that may be called to listen to an automatic announcement that includes the caller's telephone number.The ANAC number is useful primarily during the installation of landline telephones to quickly identify one of multiple lines.Operation ==A technician calls the local telephone number of the automatic number announcement service. This call is connected to equipment at a local central office that uses a voice synthesizer or digital samples to announce the telephone number of the line calling in. The main purpose of this system is to allow telephone company technicians to identify the telephone line they are connected to.Automatic number announcement systems are based on automatic number identification, and meant for phone company technicians, the ANAC system works with unlisted numbers, numbers with caller ID blocking, and numbers with no outgoing calls allowed. Installers of multi-line business services where outgoing calls from all lines display the company's main number on call display can use ANAC to identify a specific line in the system, even if CID displays every line as "line one".Some ANACs are very regional or local in scope, while others are state-/province- or area-code-wide: there appears to be no consistent national system for them. Most are provider-specific. Every telephone company, whether large or small, determines its own ANAC for each individual central office, which tends to perpetuate the current situation of a mess of overlapping and/or spotty areas of coverage.[artofhacking.com List of local ANAC phone numbers] in United States, Canada, Australia and Britain No official lists of ANAC numbers are published as telephone companies believe overuse of these numbers could make them more likely to be busy when needed by installers.958 local test exchangesUnder the North American Numbering Plan, almost all North American area codes reserve telephone numbers beginning with ''958'' and ''959'' for internal local and long distance testing (respectively), sometimes called plant testing. (One exception is Winnipeg, which reserves ''959'' only). Numbers within this block are used for various test utilities such as a ringback number (to test the ringer when installing telephone sets), milliwatt tone (a number simply answers with a continuous test tone) and a loop around (which connects a call to another inbound call to the same or another test number). ANAC numbers can also appear in the ''958'' range, but there is no requirement that they reside there.In some area codes, multiple additional prefixes had been reserved for test purposes, in addition to the standard 958 and 959. Many area codes reserved 999; 320 was also formerly reserved in Bell Canada territory. As widespread inefficiencies in numbering (such as the assignment of entire blocks of 10000 numbers to every competing carrier in every small village to support local number portability schemes) have created shortages of available numbers, these prefixes are often "reclaimed" and issued as standard exchanges, moving the handful of numbers in them to one standard test exchange (usually 958).Some carriers have been known to disable payphone calls to 958 or 959 test lines, such as Bell Canada's system-wide ANAC line at '''(area code) 958-2580'''. Conversely, a standard line on which voice service has been unsubscribed (such as an ADSL dry loop) may still accept calls to the 958 test exchange but not allow calls to standard numbers. This "soft disconnect" condition is intended to allow calls to 9-1-1 emergency services and to the telco business office to order telephone service, but to no other numbers.Tollfree numbersSome large telephone companies have toll-free numbers set up. In most cases, these numbers remain undisclosed to prevent abuse, but MCI maintains this widely published, toll-free ANAC: '''1-800-437-7950'''. This is distinct from technical support and other lines which use ANI so that a computer can automatically display the customer's account on a "screen pop" for the next available customer service representative: the MCI number is intended specifically for ANAC use.Formerly, some companies changed their ANAC number every month for secrecy; this is still the case with a few numbers. In one example of this concern, most payphones in the United States are assigned a telephone number and can ring if the number is called. The phone can then be used to make and receive calls by anyone, making it a potential tool in anonymous criminal activity such as narcotics trafficking. Where a payphone does not have any number listed on the unit, the number can be discovered by calling an ANAC service.Late in the 20th century, caller ID and prepaid cellphone service became commonplace. These services being more easily exploited for criminal purposes, this type of abuse of payphones faded from concern. In Canada, this behaviour has always been more difficult. As a matter of course, incoming calls to payphones are disabled; furthermore, the Bell ANAC number is also disabled (although the telephone number is marked on the payphone itself as it is needed to report a non-working coin phone to 6-1-1 repair service).There are some private national toll-free numbers that use ANI and then have a computer read back the number that is calling, but these are not intended for use in identifying the customer's own phone number. They are used in order for the agent in the call center to confirm the phone the customer is calling from, so that a computer can automatically display the customer's account on a "screen pop" for the next available customer service representative; they are distinct from purpose-made toll-free ANAC numbers. Regardless, if one were to call one of these numbers, listen for the number confirmation and hang up, they would in effect be using this system as if it were an ANAC.One such toll-free service is one owned by MCI - 1-800-444-4444. This number (US only) is easy to remember and, when called, will read back the number after a very short message. A suspended (out of service) line or an incoming only line would not be able to reach any toll-free numbers.ANAC numbersThese numbers appear on various lists circulated on-line, many from the 1980s and 1990s. Most were published years ago by Phrack, 2600 Magazine, the alt.2600 Usenet newsgroup, rev 0.14, part 2 of 4 (2000/05/29) is the most common list, hopelessly out of date. (as part of the FAQ) or phone phreaks and are now hopelessly outdated. The information is not reliable, as numbers change often. Many of the listed numbers no longer work.The list is presented by area code, number and location. In some regions, there are several numbers, depending on the telephone company or the area code of the caller, as there can be several central offices serving some areas.United StatesThe North American Numbering Plan reserves 958-XXXX and 1-NPA-959-XXXX for local and long-distance test numbers in almost all USA and Canadian area codes.Frequently, a prefix outside the 958 or 959 range (such as 200, 997, 998, 999) was also listed as a test exchange, only to be reclaimed and issued as a block of standard numbers at a later date. NANPA's utilised codes report will indicate 'UA' (unassignable) for valid test prefixes; if a formerly 'UA' code newly appears on the available list or becomes an active exchange, any former test numbers from its time as a reserved prefix are presumed invalid and deprecated. N11 prefixes such as 211, 311 and 511 are also disappearing as test numbers as these codes are reassigned to local services such as city, community or highway information.;958, 959 test prefixes: The standard location for test numbers in most NANP area codes, although specific local numbers vary. 1-NPA-959 traditionally contained long-distance test numbers, but this convention is often ignored; AT;T's 959-1122 and GTE (Verizon)'s 959-1114 are local. Some area codes will flag additional codes as 'UA' or unassignable, in some cases reserving them for test numbers.A few commonly-used 958 or 959 numbers for major incumbent landline carriers:* 958, as a three-digit number in many former NYNEX/Bell Atlantic areas, now Verizon or FairPoint (207 ME, 212 NY, 215 PA, 315 NY, 413 MA, 508 MA, 516 NY, 603 NH, 609 NJ, 610 PA, 617 MA, 718 NY, 732 NJ, 856 NJ, 958 NJ)* 959-1114 Verizon, for all former GTE points in California (area codes 310, 714, 760, 805); also Southwestern VA (276), Farmersburg/North Terre Haute/South Terre Haute/Riley IN (812) and Durham, NC (919)* 959-1122 PacBell (AT;T), all points (California area codes 209, 213, 310, 408, 415, 510, 530, 619, 650, 714, 760, 805, 831, 909, 916 and 925)* 959-1122 Southwestern Bell (AT;T), (417 MO, 620 KS, 816 MO, 913 KS, 817 TX, 972 TX and 682 TX)Numbers otherwise vary arbitrarily by locality:* 216: 959-9892 Akron/Canton/Cleveland/Lorain/Youngstown, OH* 301: 958-9968 Hagerstown/Rockville, MD* 309: 959-1114 Central IL (Frontier, Ex-Verizon)* 309: 959-9833 Quad City IA/IL Area (AT;T)* 412: 959-1114 Pittsburgh PA (Verizon)* 503: 958 Portland, OR (CLEC, MCIMetro ATS)* 602/623/480: 958-7847 Phoenix Metro Area (Qwest)* 610: 958-4100 Allentown/Reading, PA* 717: 958 Harrisburg/Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, PA* 724: 959-1114 Pittsburgh PA (Verizon)* 787: 787-959-1240 Puerto Rico (PRTC)* 787: 787-959-1250 Puerto Rico (PRTC)* 805: 959-1123 Bakersfield/San Luis Obispo, CA (?)
