1CryptologyThe article is misleading to the reader in that it confuses cryptography with cryptology (and in fact it suggests that cryptoanalysis is a part of cryptography). I know it's been already discussed zillion times before through the wikipedia history, and different editors have various ideas, possibly there are even some differences in the popular American vs British usage but still it stays confusing. Can we make the distinction clear, based on strong linguistic sources rather than individual editors' opinions ? Similar confusion is common in other languages, still most other wikis have this already properly handled. --Lysytalk 19:00, 24 September 2011 (UTC): Hence the expression "cryptographic attack" would be an oxymoron. But a quick search on Google scholar shows that the expression can be found in over 500 papers. This clearly indicates that even the experts do not always distinguish between the terms cryptography and cryptology. Wikipedia should merely state how a term is used and not try to correct rsp. redefine it. At the moment the article seems to achieve this reasonably well.

While codes evolved in history as a wartime tool, which lends itself to the idea that adversaries and evading detection are core of the definition, I think "cryptography" as a subject has been reclaimed by academia, culture, and modernity. Modern uses of cryptography include ssh keys, Bitcoin, barcodes and QR codes, etc. '''Andrevan'''User_talk:Andrevan|@ 16:54, 28 November 2013 (UTC)ZXX fontCan fonts as Sang Mun's ZXX be mentioned in the article ?They appearantly can't be read by OCR software (at least not at present).See* * KVDP (talk) 16:53, 16 February 2014 (UTC): I think that would best be mentioned over at Steganography, the Digital subsection, since the idea behind it is not to encrypt but rather to obfuscate the message in such a way that the enemy, in this case a machine, won't recognize that it even exists, yet to leave it in plain sight and easily recognized by the intended recipients, humans.

The Global surveillance template (on the right) was added, which I replaced with a link to the Global surveillance article in the See also section.
