-----The following has been moved here from Talk:Ase (Ase redirects to Asa):Removed:'''Ase''' , plural '''Asen''', horses have been ancient pre-christian German revered beings (gods, spirits or deities). The Angle Saxon form is ''assa'', ''assen'', M.E. ''asse'', Celtic ''assan'', Latin ''asinus'' meaning donkey (small horse).'''Assaran''' is an Old Prussian language word meaning watering hole for horses, or lake. It is derived fromm ''assa'' and water spirit Ran.---Aesir is the name of the family of gods headed by Odin. What exactly do they have to do with horses?  gives ase as an Old German form of "god" from Proto-IndoEuropean "aes" meaning light.

Or move ASA to here, either would work.70.49.36.110 23:22, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC):Indeed. However, it may be too onerous to find all the links into this page and to update them. As well, in the future people may end up re-creating this page... Instead, I chose to keep both pages, using '''ASA''' for the related initialisms and '''Asa''' for names. ppblais 03:26, 8 March 2006 (UTC)
