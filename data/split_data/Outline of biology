Index of biology articlesDrosophila melanogaster, commonly used as a model organismphysicalThe following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to biology:'''Biology''' ;ndash; study of living organisms. It is concerned with the characteristics, classification, and behaviors of organisms, how species come into existence, and the interactions they have with each other and with the environment. Biology encompasses a broad spectrum of academic fields that are often viewed as independent disciplines. However, together they address phenomena related to living organisms (biological phenomena) over a wide range of scales, from biophysics to ecology. All concepts in biology are subject to the same laws that other branches of science obey, such as the laws of thermodynamics and conservation of energy.Branches of biologyBranch of biology ;ndash; subdiscipline of biology, also referred to as a biological science.
