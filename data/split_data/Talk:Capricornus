Old talk page.NotesThe Enki page says that Enki is the Sumerian god that originated the Capricorn. -- Error: OK, I actually read the page and noticed that Enki = Ea -- Errorsee Talk:Constellations/Exoplanets in the constellations.Planets?To explane the "Planets" headline, see Talk:Constellation/Exoplanets in the constellations.What are the traits believed to be that of a Capricorn person?  All sign should of course state them, but surprisingly it's not common.:'''Huh!??''' I don't understand? Neither Talk:Constellation nor Talk:Constellations says anything about Exoplanets. Constellations is a redirects page. In all the discussion pages, we discuss the articles and the contents of the articles. Will you please sign your comments with four tilde: ~~~~ so we can know '''when''' you wrote your comment. It is namely possible that these articles about constellations around the ecliptic once were confused with the astrological signs, in this case Capricorn (astrology). I hope by now that the info relevant to the sky sector Capricornus is separated from the symbolisms of Capricorn (astrology). I have some interest in both topics, but I believe astrology is the last remnants of the old Assyro-Babylonian religion, otherwise almost extinct. ... said: Rursus (User talk:Rursus|'''mbork³;/u;''') 14:01, 30 August 2009 (UTC)Name RevisitedWhile commenting on the classical-linguistic shortcomings of an astronomy professor (specifically on Scorpio vs. Scorpius) with a Latin colleague, he mentioned that the original Latin would have been "Capricornu", which struck me as odd (as Latin has perhaps 2 words that end in -u, one of which is cornu) until it dawned on me to separate them into two words: capri cornu, or "the horn of the goat".  Now, I feel that it would be significant to at least mention if not analyze this etymology in the article. 69.168.161.140 01:17, 26 October 2006 (UTC):If that etymology is mentioned in a credible source, it could be mentioned. Otherwise it would be original research and not acceptable.--JyriL talk 18:38, 11 April 2007 (UTC)Idiotic alternate viewThe perfectly ahistorical alternate view moronically tries to depict a goat! Then why, in any imaginable supernatural being's name, isn't the name of Capricornus '''Capra'''? Capricornus is not a goat! It's a goat-fish from mythology, with the fore part from a goat and the hind part a fish. These alternate views doesn't belong to wikipedia - they seems to much like original research. ''Rursus'' 20:06, 10 March 2007 (UTC):Hello there Rursus! Why screaming? ''Rursus'' 07:32, 11 April 2007 (UTC)::Huh? That was schizophrenic... The alternate view is not OR since it is referenced. I'm not convinced that it is necessary or notable, though.--JyriL talk 18:38, 11 April 2007 (UTC):::Ehhm yes, or at least a split personality, kind'a. However, it may also be seen as trollish hysteria, interspersed with coming-to-ones-senses.
