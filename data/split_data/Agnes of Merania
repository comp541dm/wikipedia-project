Her mother was Agnes of Rochlitz.In June 1196 Agnes married Philip II of France, who had repudiated his second wife Ingeborg of Denmark in 1193. Pope Innocent III espoused the cause of Ingeborg; but Philip did not submit until 1200, when, nine months after interdict had been added to excommunication, he consented to a separation from Agnes.Agnes died broken-hearted in July of the next year, at the castle of Poissy, and was buried in the Convent of St Corentin, near Nantes.FamilyAgnes and Philip had two children: Philip I, Count of Boulogne and Mary, were legitimized by the Pope in 1201 at the request of the King.
