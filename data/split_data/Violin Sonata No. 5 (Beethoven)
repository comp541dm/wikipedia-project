The '''Violin Sonata No. 5''' in F major, Opus 24, is a violin sonata by Ludwig van Beethoven. It is often known as the "Spring" sonata (Fr√ºhlingssonate), and was published in 1801.  Its dedicatee was Count Moritz von Fries, a patron to whom the fourth violin sonata, the string quintet of the same year, and the seventh symphony were also dedicated.The work is in four movements:#''Allegro''#''Adagio molto espressivo''#''Scherzo: Allegro molto''#''Rondo: Allegro ma non troppo''The Scherzo and its trio are particularly brief. The entire sonata takes approximately 22 minutes to perform. The "Spring Sonata" was the name given to it after Beethoven died.The Allegro movement is featured in the stage show ''Fame''.ReferencesExternal links***[Performance of Violin Sonata No. 5] by Corey Cerovsek (violin) and Paavali Jumppanen (piano) from the Isabella Stewart Gardner MuseumViolin Sonata 05
