Is there an article for that? Or maybe I'm wrong and that would also be part of alternate history? (In that case however parts of this article would need to be rewritten.)Basically it's '''alternate recent history of humanity vs. history of the Earth'''...and actually also '''vs. alternate long history of humanity''' (prehistory and human evolution).Thinking about this since I wasn't sure whether or not to categorize The Long Earth under ''alternate history novels''. It's not an alternate history novel as outlined in this article, so what to do now?--'''F'''ix'''uture''' (talk) 18:46, 22 August 2015 (UTC)Alternate vs. Counterfactual HistoryIn the section definitions we read that "Alternate history is related to but distinct from counterfactual history", yet in history of alternate history literature (awful wording and all), we read that "The earliest example of an alternate (or counterfactual) history is found in Livy's Ab Urbe condita".  AUC is ''not'' fiction, it is history, and therefore the section in question is, according to the definitions section, not counterfactual history but alternate history.  And yet the section on the history of alternate history implies that counterfactual and alternate history are the same. (Likewise, the counterfactual history in Machiavelli's Discourses, also mentioned, is not fiction, nor is ''If it had happened otherwise'').

Perhaps even a table of publication date, accuracy, followed accepted history until when, etc... That sort of thing.One other point of discussion: is Orwell's 1984 in any of these similar categories?
