(European-Russian Soyuz commercialization)Competition and pricingSpace launch market competitionIn 2004, Arianespace held more than 50 percent of the world market for boosting satellites to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO).The disruptive force represented in new sector entrant SpaceX, forced Arianespace to cut workforce, and focus on cost-cutting, to decrease costs to remain competitive against the new low-cost entrant in the launch sector. According to one Arianespace managing director, ""It's quite clear there's a very significant challenge coming from SpaceX," he said. "Therefore things have to change … and the whole European industry is being restructured, consolidated, rationalised and streamlined."In the midst of pricing pressure from U.S. company SpaceX, Arianespace made a November 2013 announcement of pricing flexibility for the "lighter satellites" it carries to Geostationary orbits aboard its Ariane 5.In early 2014, Arianespace requested additional subsidies from European governments to face the competition from SpaceX and unfavorable changes in the Euro-Dollar exchange rate. Reducing pricing allowed Arianespace to sign four additional contracts in September 2014 for a lower slots on an Ariane 5 SYLDA dispenser for the satellites that otherwise could be flown on SpaceX launch vehicle. Overall Arianespace signed 11 contracts in 2014 until September with two additional being in a late stage of negotiations. September Arianespace has a backlog of launches worth 4.5 billion with 38 satellites to be launched on Ariane 5, 7 on Soyuz and 9 on Vega, claiming 60% of global satellite launch market.By November 2014, SpaceX had "already begun to take market share"sn20141120from Arianespace, and Eutelsat CEO Michel de Rosen—a major customer of Arianespace—said that "Each year that passes will see SpaceX advance, gain market share and further reduce its costs through economies of scale."sn20141120Launch VehiclesCurrently Arianespace operates 3 launch vehicles, including two versions of Ariane 5:{| class="wikitable sortable"|-!scope="col"|Name!scope="col"|Payload to LEO (including SSO)!scope="col"|Payload to GTO|-| Vega| kg| -|-| Soyuz| kg| kg|-| Ariane 5 ECA| -| kg|-| Ariane 5 ES| kg| -|}Additionally Arianespace offers optional back-up launch service on H-IIA through Launch Services Alliance.Ariane launch vehiclesAriane (rocket family)Since the first launch in 1979, there have been several versions of the Ariane launch vehicle:*Ariane 1, first successful launch on December 24, 1979*Ariane 2, first successful launch on November 20, 1987 ''(the first launch on May 30, 1986 failed)''*Ariane 3, first successful launch on August 4, 1984*Ariane 4, first successful launch on June 15, 1988*Ariane 5, first successful launch on October 30, 1997 ''(the first launch on June 4, 1996 failed)''.Ariane's CupThe Ariane's Cup is a sailing competition organized on behalf of the Industrials participating in the Ariane programme.See alsoCompanies*Europa rocket*Launch Services AllianceReferences
