UntitledWhen "Henry V"'s text gets uploaded to the William Shakespeare article, a reference to Act 4, Scene III should be sufficient -- it's consists of the quoted speech and nothing more. For now I thought it worthwhile to include it here. --PaulDryeChanges by AntonioGramsci2011 at 12:01 on 26 November 2015‎The article was changed by AntonioGramsci2011 at 12:01 on 26 November 2015‎. Two changes were made:#The photo caption that read 'Site of the battle of Agincourt' was changed to 'Site of the battle of Azincourt'#The lead sentence was changed from 'Azincourt (...; historically, '''Agincourt''' ... in English)' to 'Azincourt (...; historically, '''Azincourt''' ... in English)'The first change is incorrect. The common name of the battle in English is unquestionably Agincourt and this is WP:EN. The second change entirely defeats the purpose of the 'historically in English' phrase, which is to explain why (in English) the name of the battle is spelled differently to the commune it is clearly derived from.I have therefore reverted the change. -- chris_j_wood (talk) 14:06, 26 November 2015 (UTC)External links modifiedHello fellow Wikipedians,I have just added archive links to 2 external links on Azincourt.
