AlfonsoAlfonso'''Alphons''' (Latinized ''Alphonsus, Adelphonsus, Adefonsus'') is a male given name recorded from the 8th century (Alfonso I of Asturias, r. 739-757) in the Christian successor states of the Visigothic kingdom in the Iberian peninsula. In the later medieval period it became a standard name in the Hispanic and Portuguese royal families.It is derived from a Gothic name, or a conflation of several Gothic names; from ''*Aþalfuns'', composed of the elements ''aþal'' "noble" and ''funs'' "eager, brave, ready", and perhaps influenced by names such as ''*Alafuns'', ''*Adefuns'' and ''*Hildefuns''.It is recorded as ''Adefonsus'' in the 9th and 10th century,and as ''Adelfonsus'', ''Adelphonsus'' in the 10th to 11th. The reduced form ''Alfonso'' is recorded in the late 9th century, and the Portuguese form ''Afonso'' from the early 11th.José Pedro Machado, ''Dicionário Onomástico Etimológico da Língua Portuguesa''E.
