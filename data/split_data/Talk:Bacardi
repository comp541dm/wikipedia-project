Why don't they explined its new Puerto Rican heritage just like it touched a tad on the Spanish heritage, before Mr Bacardi started the business in Santiago de Cuba.:I added a "heritage" tag so that your question wouldn't be way above the table.

If a Cuban had a son born in Puerto Rico his son doesn't continue to be Cuban, that son is now Puerto Rican, just like Bacardi is not Catalan or Spanish Rum just because Facundo Bacardi was born in Spain. The Bacardi family already had a history of cultivating vineyards in Spain before coming to Cuba, all they did in Cuba was change  direction from wine vineyards to rum sugar-cane cultivation they were already working with the basics in Spain. Who knows, maybe for Spain, Bacardi, is actually their heritage and they are retelling this same story from there historical point of view. The fact is that this article is POORLY, POORLY, POORLY written and is not giving credit where credit is due.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/65.11.194.130|65.11.194.130 (talk) 16:07, 24 January 2009 (UTC);; ;;:It isn't poorly written, it's just incomplete as the history stops at 1959.

Bacardi rum is also made in Mexico.  So it is a Puerto Rican Rum as much as it is a Mexican rum according to the previous logic. The rum was made and created originally in Cuba so no matter what you want to call it, I believe that it is a Cuban rum.  The new products can now be called Puerto Rican or Mexican but the original rum was and always will be Cuban.

Far be it for me, a humble newbie, to try to disrupt the culture that's already established. I was hoping to get a pointer to a longer debate on this issue as I'm sure others before me have hashed this out already. I must say, at first blush, I heartily disagree with this policy. In fact, I find it somewhat absurd. I've never been a fan of any site anywhere that feels other sites need permission to link to their site. The Internet is all about links. It's not my fault that a given browser decides to save me the trouble of clicking a link by rendering a link graphic inline for me. In this vein, I hope it would not be disallowed to simply place a link (that didn't render inline) to a site. I.e. an external link. That would _really_ be stretching a point.At any rate, it strikes me as a very sad thing that we can't link to graphics. The growing 'pedia will be a dreary place indeed without any art.I don't claim to fully understand copyright law. I'm not a lawyer. I am an IT Director so I do appreciate concepts such as intellectual property rights and such. I don't want anyone to lose potential revenue. But it seems to me that if you put a graphic (or any material) on a public website, then there's no foul in someone else linking to the site. That's the whole _point_ of the Internet. No?Finally, again let me stress, I'm in no way trying to impose my sensibility on this community. I am the newbie. I was "boldly editing" and boldly re-editing. And I will now stop. I will never link to a graphic again. But I wanted to add my thoughts to the debate (which I do hope is raging somewhere around here though I haven't found it yet). Ultimately the decision needs to be made by the owner of the hardware equipment which hosts wikipedia (the server(s)). Legally, I believe it to be true that only he/they has legal control of the content here (not withstanding any sort of GNU public license or other quasi-legal instruments.) I haven't quite determined who runs the show here. I suspect it's a Mr. L. Sanger. (?)Know that I did try to learn what the policy on this subject was. I read thouroughly the Wikipedia Policy, Etiquette, Faux Pas, and Rules documents. Couldn't find any mention of this subject. It seems to me that it needs a big red warning somewhere if this is so taboo.Thanks for listening. I'll go back to editing now. So many typos and grammar errors.... so little time. :)----It's misleading to say that it's community consensus. It's foremost a legal conclusion. The courts (at least in the US) have ruled that making such links may be considered copyright violation. It's illegal. It's an annoying decision, because, as you say, you're just making a link.

The original product is now known as Havana Club which features a completly different (and IMHO ''much'' better) taste than Bacardi. The article also fails to mention the Bacardi company's attempt to steal the name and reputation of the latter rum by selling their own re-labeled as "Havana Club" in the US. In fact, the article doesn't even mention the name "Havana Club" at all AFAICS, despite the great focus on the pre-US history of Bacardi Rum. So seriously, even communist bashing is violating the NPOV. -- Mudd1 08:00, 3 May 2006 (UTC)—I'm fully in agreement about the Havana Club.

This was the subject of a lawsuit by Havana Club, as they own the old Bacardi family distillery and thus the right to the name and founding date, but it was unsuccessful, due, if I remember rightly, to the US/Cuba problem, ie the Cuban company haven't a chance in a US court - they can't even enter the country. So the Bacardi family and company are nothing to do with this lot. In fact, this needs to be stressed in the article. Can someone do this?

The propaganda tactics used in this article are very obvious.Example:The RECE (Cuban Representation in Exile) also receives funding from Bacardi family members. Activists for the RECE include Luis Posada Carriles, a terrorist involved in the bombing of Cubana Flight 455 in which 77 people died.It's like saying:Mercedes-Benz automobiles are made in Germany, the same country that produced the Nazis.  The Nazis killed millions of innocent people.  World War II, which the Nazis started, led to the establishment of Israel.  The establishment of Israel is at the crux of the conflict against Islamic terrorism today.  Islamic terrorists caused 9/11.  9/11 prompted U.S. and Coalition forces to invade Iraq.  Iraq caused the Democrats to win the Congress.Actually, the comparison in the article is far worse because the RECE and Carriles share only a casual relationship, and Carriles has merely been accused by Castro and other unaccountable dictators of involvment in Cubana Flight 455.  Carriles denies involvement......With respect, it's hardly a 'communist' rant - the statements made in  the article are nothing like your comments - as any level minded person would realise (the example might have been better with VW's btw, which were made under the nazis...). He hasn't 'merely' been accused - there is good documented evidence about Carriles' links and involvement in said organisations and activities.Update- for example - see this article - where Carriles admits to taking CANF money for terrorist activities.----Ian WilliamsI'm removing the recent addition about Ian Williams, which was completely false, stating that Bacardi had first developed his rum in Jamaica.  When asked by Democracy Now if Bacardi's origins are in Jamaica, Ian Williams immediately says no.  His claim is that a Jamaican moved to Cuba to distill rum, and that "it looks like" (meaning he's not sure) Facundo Bacardi might have acquired his distillery and used the same still (and nothing even suggests the still wasn't built in Cuba).  There isn't a single claim anywhere on the web that the Bacardi line was created anywhere other than Cuba, not sure why this was taken so out of context.:"This shit is the real deal."

WP:BTW applies here, since articles on specific brands already existed, some of which were not linked to here until the complete list was introduced.  Brand enumerations are common across Wikipedia (cars, films, to name two other categories for starters).  Acquired brands in particular have histories that are worthy of their own articles, made evident by existing articles and facilitated in the future by having a brand list here.  The only WP:NOTCATALOG prohibition even vaguely applicable is point 4 of "Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a dictionary:Wikipedia is not a directory" which challenges the inclusion of "sales catalogs" with prices.  There has been a list of brands in the article dating back .  All of these are reasons for the recent WP:3RR violation to be reverted. Thanks.

First, WP:BTW is an argument for including a list of brands that have Wikipedia entries, not for including an exhaustive list of brands. Second, an exhaustive list of brands is uninteresting. Third, an exhaustive list of brands is likely to become out of date. Fourth, an up to date list of brands is available (I think) via an external list. Fifth, the list as proposed contains way too much upper case. Sixth, there may not be prices listed, but it sure looks like a sales catalog to me. Seventh, there already is a list of brands. It's notable and interesting that Bacardi makes a brand of vermouth, but not that it makes a hundred different kinds of rum that all have "Bacardi" in their name, at least not interesting enough to list them all.

There's ample evidence everywhere that lists of brands or products are a generally interesting topic.:# I agree that a list can become out-of-date, but that's true of all sorts of lists, for example lists of episodes of current television series, or list of automobile brands from present-day manufacturers.  Update after can be used.:#"An up to date list of brands is available" (please clarify this one):#I agree about the upper-case.  I'll fix this.:#Mentioning a brand does not constitute a sales catalog.  Again, look around at all of the brands already in Wikipedia.  Heck, just by listing a book's ISBN number or mentioning a film's DVD availability you're doing more to use Wikipedia as a sales catalog than you do in this case (that's because books and DVDs are much easier to buy online than alcohol).:#What I thought made sense was to have the narrative that currently exists as an introduction to highlights within the brand list, an approach used frequently by people working on an actor's Wikipedia biography.::Thanks.
