C'mon guys, we can do better than thatThe section on the European monarchies is laughable, it's very biased and much of it is not true, by the time of WWI most, if not all, the monarchies of Europe were constitutional monarchies, this meant that the monarchs held little, if any, power. King George V or the Kaiser can hardly be blamed for the war. The only true, functional monarchies were the Russian Empire (which was evolving into a constitutional monarchy) and Liechtenstein (which was never a combatant in WWI and hasn't had an armed forces for nearly 200 years)Even as early as Queen Victoria's time, the monarchy in most European powers was merely a tradition and the monarch a figurehead and France had been a republic for decades.

Accordingly, Augustinian philosophy, which is prominent among Roman Catholics and Protestants, interprets free will and divine grace in a way that allows for greater personal freedom in choosing a salvation which is freely offered by God. The emphasis on personal freedom and non-coercive choice plays a prominent role in anti-Communist political rhetoric in Western nations. In contrast, the Eastern Orthodox have been labeled semi-pelagian because they do not exactly share the same beliefs on original sin and will often oppose augustinian doctrines on infusion of grace and freedom of conscience. Therefore, several Eastern Orthodox beliefs that are taught in Russia and the former Soviet Union are arguably closer to Communism than Western views shared by Roman Catholics and Protestants.

I can say that this article is one of the worst-written in Wikipedia. The mere fact that it tries to speak about anti-Communism in both Communist and non-Communist countries is already a bad concept. In my view this entire article should be broken into fragments and not lumped together as it is. To be an anti-Communist in America is a different issue than being one in a Communist country. The article is so bad that it cannot even be fixed.Sensei2004 (talk) 13:32, 9 January 2013 (UTC)Anti communism or criticism of (totalitarian) communist regimés?What exacly is this article.For example the European Union condemns the crimes of totalitarian communist regimés. Not communism itself, from which many of its founding pillars on human rights have been formed. Such as the right to education and health which derive from early socialist and communisty theory.There needs be a clear distinction between these two things and if need be a new article dealing with anti-communism.For example it is clear that the views of the soviet left are not anti-communist but anti-stalinist (that article already exists).Hitler was staunchly anti-communist but not anti totalitarian.The American form of anti-communism also differs from much of the criticism against communist regimés in Europe as america is one of very few nations who does not recognise the full charter of UN human rights (in terms of positive freedoms - that is rights to education, healthcare, work and housing - all communist/socialist principles).I hope that this can be resolved.

Repression of political opinion, mass murders etc. For instance, in the Serbian section there is a mention of chetniks, but anticommunism started earlier, in 1920., when communist party, third largest in the parliament was banned and "reduced in size" by 90 % (meaning their members and sympathizers were imprisoned). The same is with prewar Poland; nazi-Germany and various fascist regime weren't mentioned (although they were, apart from nazi-Germany, more anticommunist then antidemocratic or antisemitic). Salvador Allende, as a victim of anticommunist crimes isn't mentioned. New Brazilian president as a victim of anticommunist persecution isn't mentioned.This article is one-sided with obvious intention to show that anticommunism is something good with almost complete lack of crimes committed by anticommunists.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/193.198.162.14|193.198.162.14 (talk) 14:12, 4 November 2010 (UTC);; ;;Anti fascists commited crimes against fascists and fascism is illegal in many contries but no one talks about that so why should communism get special treatment the truth is that governments dont like political extremists Irishfrisian (talk) 19:00, 10 July 2012 (UTC)pre Cold WarThe article currently claims that "anti-communism didn’t become a significant force until the beginning of the Cold War in 1947.".

Special:Contributions/188.192.9.154|188.192.9.154 (talk) 22:46, 20 April 2011 (UTC):Yes, it is historically undeniable that anti-communism was a defining characteristic of Nazism, Italian Fascism, not to mention Francoism in Spain... The Kuomintang initially included communists among its members, but then Chiang Kai-shek carried out a violent anti-communist purge. Another problem with the article as it stands is that it says very little about opposition to communism from democratic socialists and social democrats. And what it does say about social democrats is inconsistent. Under the heading "Ex-communists", the reader is told "Many ex-communists have turned into anti-communists. Mikhail Gorbachev turned from a communist into a social democrat." Which seems to imply that a social democrat is necessarily an anti-communist. But then a few sentences later we are told about "Anti-communists who were ''once'' socialists, modern liberals or social democrats..." Does that mean you don't become an anti-communist until you have ''stopped'' being a social democrat, socialist, or liberal?

I'm certainly not saying anything against the Falun Gong demonstrators or the validity of their protest(s). I'm just wondering if protesting against a government who happens to be communist, because that government is repressing them specifically, is the same thing as protesting that government because they are communist (i.e. I'd argue their protest are based on the government's actions toward them, not on the government's communist nature. They're not protesting communism, which would be anti-communist, but are protesting A communist government's actions, which aren't directly realted to communism in general, but rather China's specific forms of repression. Just thought it might be stretching things a bit to label them communist. Like, if the guy down the block steals my bike, and happens to be communist, me yelling at him "I want my bike back" is not anti communist...I'm not yelling at him for being communist, I'm yelling at him because he's got my damn bike:)Jbower47 (talk) 21:24, 12 July 2011 (UTC)Completely agreed.

They originally did not have a problem with the government (and vice-versa), but several years after the persecution they began targeting the CPC directly, rather than simply its anti-Falun Gong policies. To draw on your apt bicycle analogy, if you kept getting your bike stolen, after each time you bought a new one, and every time it was a communist who stole it, and explained the reasons for their theft in terms of their communism, sooner or later you'd start to dislike communists. Just guessing. But anyway, I think Falun Gong do belong here because of the direction their resistance took in around 2004/2005 - but I'm wondering whether the picture is undue weight.
