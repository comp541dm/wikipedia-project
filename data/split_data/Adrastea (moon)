It was discovered in photographs taken by ''Voyager2'' in 1979, making it the first natural satellite to be discovered from images taken by an interplanetary spacecraft, rather than through a telescope.IAUC 3454 It was officially named after the mythological Adrasteia, foster mother of the Greek god Zeus—the equivalent of the Roman god Jupiter.IAUC 3872Adrastea is one of the few moons in the Solar System known to orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet's day. It orbits at the edge of Jupiter's Main Ring and is thought to be the main contributor of material to the Rings of Jupiter. Despite observations made in the 1990s by the ''Galileo'' spacecraft, very little is known about the moon's physical characteristics other than its size and the fact that it is tidally locked to Jupiter.Discovery and observationsFile:Adrastée FDS 20630.png|thumb|300px|left|Discovery image of Adrastea, taken on July 8, 1979, by Voyager2. Adrastea is the fainter dot, in the very middle, straddling the line of the Jovian rings.Adrastea was discovered by David C. Jewitt and G. Edward Danielson in ''Voyager 2|Voyager2'' probe photographs taken on July 8, 1979, and received the designation ''''''.IAUC 34541979 Although it appeared only as a dot,1979 it was the first moon to be discovered by an interplanetary spacecraft. Soon after its discovery, two other of the inner moons of Jupiter (Thebe and Metis) were observed in the images taken a few months earlier by ''Voyager 1|Voyager1''. The ''Galileo'' spacecraft was able to determine the moon's shape in 1998, but the images remain poor.1998 In 1983, Adrastea was officially named after the Greek nymph Adrastea, the daughter of Zeus and his lover Ananke.IAUC 3872Physical characteristicsAdrastea has an irregular shape and measures 20×16×14km across.1998 A surface area estimate would be between 840 and 1,600 (~1,200) km2. This makes it the smallest of the four inner moons. The bulk, composition and mass of Adrastea are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea,2004 around 0.86g/cm³,2005 its mass can be estimated at about 215kg. Amalthea's density implies that the moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10–15%, and Adrastea may be similar.2005No surface details of Adrastea are known, due to the low resolution of available images.1998OrbitAdrastea is the smallest and second closest member of the inner Jovian satellite family. It orbits Jupiter at a radius of about 129,000km (1.806Jupiter radii) at the exterior edge of the planet's Main Ring.2004 Adrastea is one of only three moons in the Solar System known to orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet's day—the other two being Jupiter's innermost moon Metis, and Mars' moon Phobos.  The orbit has very small eccentricity and inclination—around 0.0015 and 0.03°, respectively.  Inclination is relative to the equator of Jupiter.2004Due to tidal locking, Adrastea rotates synchronously with its orbital period, keeping one face always looking toward the planet. Its long axis is aligned towards Jupiter, this being the lowest energy configuration.1998The orbit of Adrastea lies inside Jupiter's synchronous orbit radius (as does Metis’s), and as a result, tidal forces are slowly causing its orbit to decay so that it will one day impact Jupiter. If its density is similar to Amalthea's then its orbit would actually lie within the fluid Roche limit. However, since it is not breaking up, it must still lie outside its rigid Roche limit.2004Adrastea is the second-fastest moving of Jupiter's moons, with an orbital speed of 31.378km/s.Relationship with Jupiter's ringsAdrastea is the largest contributor to material in Jupiter's rings. This appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of Jupiter's four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space. This is due to the satellites' low density and their surfaces lying close to the edge of their Roche spheres.2004It seems that Adrastea is the most copious source of this ring material, as evidenced by the densest ring (the Main Ring) being located at and within  Adrastea's orbit.1999 More precisely, the orbit of Adrastea lies near the outer edge of Jupiter's Main Ring.1999  The exact extent of visible ring material depends on the phase angle of the images: in forward-scattered light Adrastea is firmly outside the Main Ring,1999 but in back-scattered light (which reveals much bigger particles) there appears to also be a narrow ringlet outside Adrastea's orbit.2004References20em'''Cited sources'''******  (discovery)*  (naming the moon)**External links19790708
