It is the third largest island in the Mediterranean (after the Italian islands of Sicily and Sardinia) and the world's 81st largest island by area. It is located south of Asia Minor, the Anatolian peninsula  of the Asian (or Eurasian) mainland (part of Turkey), so it may be included in Western Asia or the Middle East: Cyprus is close to Western Asia, Southern Europe, and Northern Africa, and has had lengthy periods of mainly Greek and intermittent Anatolian, Levantine, Byzantine, Turkish, and Western European influence. It is sometimes included in Europe,[Britannica] and the Republic of Cyprus has been a member state of the European Union since 1 May 2004.Cyprus is 240 kilometres long and  wide, with Turkey  to the north. Other neighbouring territories include Syria and Lebanon to the east (105km and , respectively), Israel  to the southeast, Egypt  to the south, and Greece to the west-northwest:  to the small Dodecanesian island of Kastellórizo|Kastellórizo (Meyísti),  to Rhodes, and  to the Greek mainland.The island is dominated by two mountain ranges, the Troodos Mountains and the Kyrenia Mountains, and the central plain, the Mesaoria, between them. The Troodos Mountains cover most of the southern and western portions of the island and account for roughly half its area. The narrow Kyrenia Range extends along the northern coastline. It is not as high as the Troodos Mountains, and it occupies substantially less area. The two mountain ranges run generally parallel to the Taurus Mountains on the Turkish mainland, the outlines of which are visible from northern Cyprus. Coastal lowlands, varying in width, surround the island.Geopolitically, the island is divided into four segments. The Republic of Cyprus, the internationally recognized government, occupies the southern two-thirds of the island. The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, diplomatically recognized only by Turkey, occupies the northern one-third of the island. The United Nations-controlled Green Line is a buffer zone that separates the two. Lastly, two bases under British sovereignty, Akrotiri and Dhekelia, are located in the south of the island.TerrainSkiriotissa mineThis image, photographed from the International Space Station in 2013, shows the three distinct geologic regions of the island. In the central and western part of the island is the Troodos Massif, a mountain range whose surface layer is mostly basaltic lava rock, and whose maximum elevation is abbr-on. Running in a thin arc along the northeast margin of the island is Cyprus's second mountain range, a limestone formation called the Kyrenia Range. The space between these ranges is home to the capital Nicosia, visible as a grayish-brown patch near the image's center.TopographyThe rugged Troodos Mountains, whose principal range stretches from Pomos Point in the northwest almost to Larnaca Bay on the east, are the single most conspicuous feature of the landscape. Intensive uplifting and folding in the formative period left the area highly fragmented, so that subordinate ranges and spurs veer off at many angles, their slopes incised by steep-sided valleys. In the southwest, the mountains descend in a series of stepped foothills to the coastal plain.While the Troodos Mountains are a massif formed of molten igneous rock, the Kyrenia Range is a narrow limestone ridge that rises suddenly from the plains. Its easternmost extension becomes a series of foothills on the Karpass Peninsula. That peninsula points toward Asia Minor, to which Cyprus belongs geologically.Even the highest peaks of the Kyrenia Range are hardly more than half the height of the great dome of the Troodos massif, Mount Olympus (), but their seemingly inaccessible, jagged slopes make them considerably more spectacular. British writer Lawrence Durrell, in Bitter Lemons, wrote of the Troodos as "an unlovely jumble of crags and heavyweight rocks" and of the Kyrenia Range as belonging to "the world of Gothic Europe, its lofty crags studded with crusader castles."Rich copper deposits were discovered in antiquity on the slopes of the Troodos. The massive sulfide deposits formed as a part of an ophiolite complex at a spreading center under the Mediterranean Sea which was tectonically uplifted during the Pleistocene and emplaced in its current location.DrainageIn much of the island, access to a year-round supply of water is difficult. This is traditionally attributed to deforestation which damaged the island's drainage system through erosion, but Grove and Rackham question this view. A network of winter rivers rises in the Troodos Mountains and flows out from them in all directions. The Yialias River and the Pedhieos River flow eastward across the Mesaoria into Famagusta Bay; the Serraghis River flows northwest through the Morphou plain. All of the island's rivers, however, are dry in the summer. An extensive system of dams and waterways has been constructed to bring water to farming areas.The Mesaoria is the agricultural heartland of the island, but its productiveness for wheat and barley depends very much on winter rainfall; other crops are grown under irrigation. Little evidence remains that this broad, central plain, open to the sea at either end, was once covered with rich forests whose timber was coveted by ancient conquerors for their sailing vessels. The now-divided capital of the island, Nicosia, lies in the middle of this central plain.Natural vegetationCyprus countryside on the way to Troodos Mountains during the summerDespite its small size, Cyprus has a variety of natural vegetation. This includes forests of conifers and broadleaved trees such as ''Pinus brutia'', cedar, cypresses and oaks. Ancient authors write that most of Cyprus, even Messaoria, was heavily forested, and there are still considerable forests on the Troodos and Kyrenia ranges, and locally at lower altitudes. About 17% of the whole island is classified as woodland. Where there is no forest, tall shrub communities of golden oak (''Quercus alnifolia''), strawberry tree (''Arbutus andrachne''), terebinth (''Pistacia terebinthus''), olive (''Olea europaea''), kermes oak (''Quercus coccifera'') and styrax (''Styrax officinalis'') are found, but such maquis is uncommon. Over most of the island untilled ground bears a grazed covering of garrigue, largely composed of low bushes of Cistus, ''Genista sphacelata'', ''Calycotoime villosa'', ''Lithospermum hispidulum'', ''Phaganalon rupestre'' and, locally, ''Pistacia lentiscus''. Where grazing is excessive this covering is soon reduced, and an impoverished batha remains, consisting principally of ''Thymus capitatus'', ''Sarcopoterium spinosum'', and a few stunted herbs.ClimateClimate of Cyprusright|200px|Sandstorm in the Levant, October 19, 2002The Mediterranean climate, warm and rather dry, with rainfall mainly between November and March, favors agriculture. In general, the island experiences mild wet winters and dry hot summers. Variations in temperature and rainfall are governed by altitude and, to a lesser extent, distance from the coast. Hot, dry summers from mid-May to mid-September and rainy, rather changeable winters from November to mid-March are separated by short autumn and spring seasons.Area and boundariesAdministrative map of CyprusPopulation map of the Republic of CyprusPopulation density map of the Republic of CyprusMunicipalities and communities map of CyprusDistrict map of CyprusPopulation distribution of Cyprus in 1960'''Area:'''''total:''9,251km² (of which  are under the control of the Republic of Cyprus and of which  are under the administration of the de facto Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus)''land:''9,241km²''water:''10km²'''Land boundaries:'''0km'''Coastline:'''648km'''Maritime claims:'''''territorial sea:''''continental shelf:''200m depth or to the depth of exploitation'''Elevation extremes:'''''lowest point:''Mediterranean Sea 0m''highest point:''Olympus 1,952m"Embassy climate"Resource and land use'''Natural resources:'''copper, pyrites, asbestos, gypsum, timber, salt, marble, clay earth pigment'''Land use:'''''arable land:''9.90%''permanent crops:''3.24%''other:''86.86% (2012)'''Irrigated land:'''457.9km² (2007)'''Total renewable water resources:'''0.78 km3 (2011)'''Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):'''''total:''0.18 km3/yr (10%/3%/86%)''per capital:''164.7 m3/yr (2009)Environmental concerns'''Natural hazards:'''moderate earthquake activity; droughts'''Environment - current issues:'''water resource problems (no natural reservoir catchments, seasonal disparity in rainfall, sea water intrusion to island's largest aquifer, increased salination in the north); water pollution from sewage and industrial wastes; coastal degradation; loss of wildlife habitats from urbanization.'''Environment - international agreements:'''''party to:''Air Pollution, Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands''signed, but not ratified:'' noneSee also*List of islands of Cyprus*List of reservoirs and dams in Cyprus*List of rivers of Cyprus*Geology of CyprusReferences****Additional referencesCyprus, GeographyCyprus
