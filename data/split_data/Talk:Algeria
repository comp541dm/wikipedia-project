Reading the Demographics section there was not one mention of the Arab aspect of Algeria. This to me appears intentional. There is, without a doubt, a massive bias towards Arabs on Wikipedia articles related to ethnicity, history, religion, etc. The Article about Algeria feeds into this phenomenon. Just as an interesting side note, even when listening to Algerian music, there are countless songs where the singer highlights his/her pride in their Arab origin. Just listen to Cheb Khaled's music!

The conquest of Algeria by the French was long and particularly violent, and it resulted in the disappearance of about a third of the Algerian population. France was responsible for the extermination of 1.5 million Algerians. According to Olivier Le Cour Grandmaison, the French pursued a policy of extermination against the Algerians.1.5 million Algerians died during the Algerian War of Independence. Genocide which was committed by the French.Algerians argue that the massacres should be named as genocide and France must apologise to the Algerians[1] [2] However the French do not accept the claims. Algeria's President Abdelaziz Bouteflika says that French colonization of his country Algeria was a form of genocide link title. In memoirs, some French officers have described torture of Algerians during the war. Edouard Sablier, for instance, one of the soldiers who took part in the repression, later described the situation: “Everywhere in the towns there were camps surrounded by barbed wire containing hundreds of suspects who had been arrested… Often, when we set out to inspect an isolated hamlet in the mountains, I heard people say, ‘We should punish them by taking away their crops’.” [3] A paper called Ohé Partisans, published by the French Trotskyists, described Sétif as an “Algerian Oradour”. Oradour was a French town where the Nazi occupiers had murdered over 600 people, including children.

Before the warming brought on by the Holocene Climatic Optimum around 7,000 years ago, the region contained vast grasslands which, along with the representations of cattle in the Tassili Plateau art, suggests the existence of early forms of pastoral agriculture. This would seem to be a logical precursor to the crop-based agriculture that developed in the Middle East in the agricultural revolution thousands of years later.The ancient paintings are also a clear indication of a form of shamanism or religion based on the use of psychedelic mushrooms. This is another reason why the region was proposed by McKenna as the cradle of culture and civilization, as the visions induced by these mushrooms give a powerful impulse towards art, painting and the sense of contact with the supernatural that is the basis of religious belief.

Does it mean that the myth of "paradise" (as told in the bible/quran/whatever) originated in ancient algeria, or does the cited author propose that civilization or/and the human race itself originated in ancient algeria? Either of these theories must be regarded as very controversial and the whole question of where these phenomena arose is extremely strange because they most likely originate in various palces independently. There is actually considerable consensus on where the first instances of "civilization" are to be located (Egypt, Mesopotamia).

I did some research and wrote new content for Languages_of_Algeria#French - The thing is, Maghreb Arabic is not intelligible with MSA Arabic. The mother tongue isn't used in government in the Maghreb any more than it is used in sub-Saharan Africa. MSA Arabic was introduced in the post-colonial era to try to replace French. Some ministries were "Arabized" but not all of them were. While the Justice Department ''was'' Arabized, the Ministry of Transport's website is only available in French: - The sourced material from "Languages_of_Algeria#French" should explain everything. The sourced material also says that French is becoming more popular in Algeria, not less, so that contradicts the assertion that, in Algeria, "with the new generations, french tends to be less attractive and english is more and more studied and learned." WhisperToMe (talk) 05:24, 13 October 2012 (UTC)Well, the CIA World Factbook says https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ag.html that French is a "lingua franca." I think that wraps it up :) WhisperToMe (talk) 05:29, 13 October 2012 (UTC)* As a note, , the CIA factbook only states "French" is a language, along with English and Armenian, spoken in Lebanon. It isn't labeled as a lingua franca or a language of commerce, business, government, and/or diplomacy. Looking at  and , French for Morocco is "often the language of business, government, and diplomacy" and French for Tunisia is a language of commerce, with Arabic being the other language of commerce WhisperToMe (talk) 05:45, 13 October 2012 (UTC)Image in the demo sectionFile:L'Algérie en guerre contre la fraude au Bac.jpg|thumb|Algerian students cramming before an examrural Algerian girl after the Independance in 1962.An anonymous editor opposes the inclusion of the image to the right in the article because it's supposedly "Arabist propaganda". He insists on including an anachronistic picture of a girl from the 1960s instead (to the left). I think that using contemporary images (not necessarily this one) is always preferable. Any comment on the issue is most welcome.--eh bien mon prince (talk) 23:15, 14 January 2013 (UTC):contemporary, definitely; I don't see Arabist propaganda, but if it makes people happy, just pick a different one...

The picture on the left is more representative as it shows the normal dressing of an Algerian farmer girl.:::: This without signaling the islamist-arabist propaganda as if algerian girls were all head scarfed, the left picture shows the real traditional clothing of an Algerian girl.:::: This is innacceptable, and User:Underlying lk please sign with your real login. -- [ Chanqariḥa (el εajeeb) ] 20:38, 17 January 2013 (UTC)  — Preceding unsigned comment added by User:Chanqariḥa|Chanqariḥa (User talk:Chanqariḥa|talk • Special:Contributions/Chanqariḥa|contribs) ;;; ;;:::::(Maybe you could sign at all before you complain about others);It's inappropriate to show a 1960s image of a nostalgic bygone era when that doesn't show contemporary reality; whether you like it or not, there are girls who wear hijabs these days. You are free to provide a contemporary picture that might suit your agenda, but a throwback to what used to be half a century ago is not it.

Another one about arabization had the same issue. Those are important cultural elements concerning Algeria. No explanation were given on the actual tp. I propose to bring them back. -- User:Chanqariḥa|Chanqariḥa (el εajeeb) 22:36, 17 January 2013 (UTC): Not every edit has to be explained on the talk page. The edit summaries exist for a reason. If you had bothered to read them, you would have known that the cinema section can now be found in Algerian cinema, while much of the Arabization section was deleted because it was unsourced. Hence, I reject your proposal.--eh bien mon prince (talk) 02:17, 18 January 2013 (UTC):: The copy isn't a complete one, content has been omitted. I'll add it back later. For the arabization section, i'm going to search for ressources. Arabization is a fact, algerians were subject to a brutal holocaust as well as an apartheid called Indigénat. arabization purpose was to reverse the consequences of that coloniale policies. So its important to the country's history. cheers -- User:Chanqariḥa|Chanqariḥa (el εajeeb) 07:41, 18 January 2013 (UTC):::Just make sure that you add them to the proper article, and that they're adequately sourced.--eh bien mon prince (talk) 09:25, 18 January 2013 (UTC)So i guess we've got a consensus with the picture i gave. -- User:Chanqariḥa|Chanqariḥa (el εajeeb) 07:42, 18 January 2013 (UTC):I actually still prefer the schoolgirls, I seriously doubt that the picture you propose is representative of modern Algerian women.--eh bien mon prince (talk) 09:25, 18 January 2013 (UTC)Page notice about the use of FrenchIs it really necessary? These page notices are rather annoying, they should be used only as last resort--eh bien mon prince (talk) 06:14, 18 February 2013 (UTC): I placed the notice because there had been a discussion in which I explained on the talk page (Talk:Algeria#French_in_lede) that French needed to be used, and that seemed to be resolved (I engaged in a similar discussion related to Morocco), and yet drive-by editors keep removing it. However there has been an inquiry about my use of page notices at Talk:Emory_University#Location_of_Emory_university.2C_confirming as there is a need to allow anonymous users to be involved in the process, so you may wish to read it. WhisperToMe (talk) 21:36, 18 February 2013 (UTC)::Before using something as visible as that we could try with a hidden comment in the wikicode, like ;;! Perhaps that will be enough.--eh bien mon prince (talk) 12:13, 19 February 2013 (UTC):::We could try that out. Unfortunately I've had cases where anonymous users ignored hidden comment codes alone. We could see if the comment alone does the trick, and see what happens... WhisperToMe (talk) 18:40, 19 February 2013 (UTC)::::I think we should try that. Besides, if someone is determined to disregard comments in the code, the page notice won't make much of a difference.--eh bien mon prince (talk) 13:59, 20 February 2013 (UTC):::::From my understanding page notices tend to jump out more than comments (which is why I used them), but I'll try the code thing and see how it goes WhisperToMe (talk) 05:56, 27 February 2013 (UTC)Petroleum topic is badly neglectedI'm surprised that this article says virtually nothing about petroleum-industry developments in the modern history of Algeria.  "Hydrocarbons" are given the briefest passing nod, though it's stated that "[Algeria's] economy is oil based" in the article's inroductory paragraphs.  Algeria became independent in 1962, and one would imagine prior to that point that the French would have been extremely interested in the country's oil reserves and probably would have been building infrastructure of some sort (exploration, drilling installations, refinement... ''what??'').  ''How'' did this industry develop to be key to the modern economy of the country?Here's a clue I found in a very quick Google search:By the way even the article on French Algeria says nothing about the oil-industry topic, either.I'm not posting this because I know the story on this subject.  It's just that the article leaves the reader uninformed.  There's a big deficiency.Joel Russ (talk) 16:03, 27 February 2013 (UTC)EtymologyThe theory of Berber origin is a brand-new hypothesis proposed and self-published online by a person who, apparently . Not a WP:Reliable Source by Wikipedia standards. The theory may well be true for all I know, and I very much sympathise with the Berbers and dislike Arabisation, but it is still a fringe theory and the author has an obvious nationalist axe to grind, so it shouldn't be on Wikipedia until it becomes more widely accepted. I'm not deleting it personally, because I'm not in the mood for having an edit war with angry nationalists, but somebody should.--Special:Contributions/91.148.130.233|91.148.130.233 (talk) 15:05, 9 May 2013 (UTC)* The actual source of the "Arab-Berber" thing in the infobox is the CIA World Factbook which is what the article uses.

It is a Maghreb country bordered by Algeria to the west, Libya to the southeast and the Mediterranean Sea to the north and east.Tunisia is almost 165,000 square kilometres (64,000 sq mi) in area, with an estimated population of just under 10.7 million. Its name is derived from the capital Tunis located in the northeast. The south of the country is composed of the Sahara desert, with much of the remainder consisting of particularly fertile soil and 1,300 kilometres (810 mi) of coastline.Tunisia has an association agreement with the European Union and is a member of the Arab Maghreb Union, the Arab League, and the African Union. Tunisia has established close relations with '''France''' in particular, through economic cooperation, industrial modernization, and privatisation programs.In 2011, a revolution resulted in the overthrow of autocratic President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and the first free elections in the country were held.
