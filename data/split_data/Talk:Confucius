Illegitimate BirthThe Records of the Grand Historian Shiji flatly state that Confucius was born as a result of a "wild union" between Shu Lianghe and a woman surnamed Yan. The Shiji makes absolutely no mention of a marriage, ceremonially defective or otherwise.The Shiji's author, Sima Qian, remains famous after more than 2000 years for calling a spade a spade, rather than a metaphorical digging implement. Sima Qian clearly revered Confucius, but did  not allow his feelings to interfere with the factual account based on the best evidence he found. Earlier edits mentioning a "marriage" that was deficient under traditional notions of ceremony (li) may be due to a misreading of the cited Chinese source. In fact, only the words rendered in blue are the actual Shiji - those in purple are (much) later commentaries.Other editors have - correctly - pointed out that the Shiji was written hundreds of years after Confucius own time. There are, of course, countless (later) hagiographic versions of Confucius' birth, but it would be slipshod to attribute these accounts to Sima Qian himself. If any editor could locate and include a sampling of those alternative accounts (preferably with approximate dates), it would help balance the account.Psychologically, the stigma of illegitimate birth makes perfect sense of a man whose life was spent considering deep issues of ritual propriety and how human relations ''should'' be regulated.  WikiFlier (talk) 07:55, 30 April 2011 (UTC)Age at DeathInconsistency.Footnote 19 is used to corroborate the statement that his age at death was 72 or 73. Why then does it appear as 71 or 72 in the summary side bar (or whatever it's called)?Of course, I realise that it is difficult to establish a person's exact age without exact birth and death dates, which are absent here. Surely, however, thearticle should strive for internal consistency in giving these estimates. POO POODate notation (eras) ;mdash; BC/AD or BCE/CEThere was a discussion, above, on the use of date notation (eras) for this article. All who spoke agreed that the MoS guideline for eras requires consistency throughout an article.  The guideliine further states that there must be a good reason for changing the era notation.  As with all articles there must be consensus of the article authors. Three people spoke to the issue and two of these preferred leaving the date notation as BCE/CE. Yet, inexplicably the notation was changed to BC/AD. The article had used BCE/CE notation for over a year prior to the change in May, 2006.actruly Confucius was born in (AD)There is good reason to restore BCE/CE notation in this article, IMO: the article is about a non-Christian subject in a non-Christian region of the world.  As the article on Common era points out: "... most Chinese have used gōngyuán (公元) to mean AD/CE, gōngyuán can be literally translated as "public era" or "metric era." Many of the articles on Buddhism and Taoism use BCE/CE notation for dates.In view of this, I am adding my vote for retaining the BCE/CE notation. I will restore that notation and urge that it be retained until such time as there is a consensus of authors to the contrary. Sunray 20:44, 20 January 2007 (UTC):The article is being proselytized.--Patchouli 23:28, 22 January 2007 (UTC)::How do you arrive at that conclusion?. Sunray 08:42, 2 February 2007 (UTC)The above was merely a justification, as requested by the guideline. Fact is that there is a consensus to use BCE. One of the reasons given for the article not achieving GA status was "No consistent usage of BC/BCE." We need to respect the consensus and keep it consistent. Sunray 05:37, 31 March 2007 (UTC):I didn't understand what BCE meant and had to look it up. Since Confucius was not Christian, I'm happy for it to be used. -- John (Daytona2·  Talk·  Special:Contributions/Daytona2|Contribs) 09:37, 3 June 2008 (UTC)VandalismI agree with the discussion (titled 'Vandalism?') at the top.

And how do his ideas on this subject differ from those of the Daoists, such as Zhuangzi? Thanks. 68.181.230.101 19:40, 23 September 2007 (UTC)According to Confucius, the root of the trouble was the failure of propriety in the family.  Confucius felt that is roles could be properly defined acted out, the world would be well governed.  This is often referred to as rectifying names.  This process must begin in the home as the child learns to behave from the example of the parents.  If the parent acts as a parent and teaches the child what is expected, the child will grow up normally.  Children will then be able to act appropriately in society in relation to superiors, friends and spouses.  The heart of this is self-restraint.Taoists generally beleive that the root of social unrest is grasping and greed.  Confucius would not have disagreed, except that Taoists tend to view human society as an arbitrary collection of rules and traditions without substance.  They tend to identify Reality with the processes of change observed in nature.  While Confucius advocated a kind of ritual propreity, this propriety or Li was intended as an expression of underlying logic as opposed to a set of hollow actions.  Taoists often argue against instances of corruption hiding under a good appearance, butn that is not really what Confucius was advocating.  Confucius was also aware of the nature of social constructs but believed that without a common frame of reference, human beings could not relate well or even survive.  He also thought that social changes were not arbitrary but were either progressive or regressive in terms of human well-being.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/68.37.30.143|68.37.30.143 (talk) 23:50, 6 June 2009 (UTC);; ;;this articledon't highlight so many of the words because then it gets hard to read.

Even today there are dedicated schools for learning Confucianism and Korean culture heavily shows some of this elements, particularly dealing with elders in the family. Also, Korea holds some of the oldest temples and heritage sites dedicated to Confucius. However, Japanese and Taiwanese nationalists wanted to use this as Korea was claiming Confucius as "Korean" ethnicity.

T-1000 (talk) 04:35, 2 May 2010 (UTC)Incorrect paragraphThis paragraph at the bottom of "Descendants" is incorrect and should be deleted or revised:"It is important to note that this only deals with those whose lines of descent are documented historically. Using mathematical models, it is easy to demonstrate that every human being alive today is likely to be a direct descendant of Confucius, even using mathematical models that assume an extremely small amount of cross cultural mating, since any human alive today would have had 1.5 sextillion ancestors alive at the time of Confucius, over a quadrillion times more than the population of the earth at the time, making descent from Confucius a mathematical certainty, even accounting for consanguinity and geographical and cultural barriers, as noted by Yale professor Joseph T. Chang[45]."The reason this paragraph is wrong is because the "most recent common ancestor" (MRCA) could be any one individual; the chance that that one individual, the MRCA, happens to be Confucius is extremely small.  Confucius didn't live far enough back in time to be a part of the "all or nothing" era, in which an individual was either an ancestor of every living human, or of no living human.  The "all or nothing" era was quite further back than Confucius (at least 2000 BC, maybe 5000 BC or even further back).  Read the referenced article for more details.   Confu123 (talk) 05:15, 4 August 2010 (UTC):I agree, and have weakened the claim in line with your comment and what I think is supported by the source::"Note that this only deals with those whose lines of descent are documented historically.

This is not correct.In common opinion of the study of ancient Chinese, the character "知" of "是知也" is different from the former four charaters "知". This character "知" is actually a borrowed character to temporarily replace the character "智", which means "wisdom". So the sentences should be translated to "Wisdom is recognizing what you know and what you don't."

Self-evidently this is the logical inverse, and the article silver rule gives a cite to Carl Sagan referring to it as such. Imaginatorium (talk) 06:33, 18 July 2015 (UTC)Thanks to CRGreathouse for a thoughtful edit that replaced "Golden Rule" with "Silver Rule." But I reverted the recent edit because the link is to the article "Golden Rule," which does not mention "SIlver Rule." I would be happy to see someone add a referenced mention of SR to the GR article and to add a mention of SR someplace in this Confucius article. This would enrich both articles since a quick Google search  on "Confucius and Silver Rule" () shows that this is an interesting point that I do not have time to pursue. So I would simply request that a mention of SR be added only if some explanation is included. (This is not quite the same as marking SR with unreferenced, so simply adding a reference to a mention in the lead would not be quite right. Cheers ch (talk) 18:42, 16 December 2015 (UTC): I agree -- the Silver Rule is interesting and worth coverage, and should not be needlessly conflated with the similar Golden Rule. But I similarly lack time to write the article, so I'll follow 0RR and leave this article with the incorrect link.: It looks like Silver Rule was an article which was replaced for no good reason with a redirect, but I don't have time for fighting that battle either.: CRGreathouse (t | Special:Contributions/CRGreathouse|c);20:27, 16 December 2015 (UTC)::The history page of the SR Redirect shows that the SR article was a stub, though I think that you and I would agree that the move might well have included incorporating a mention of SR. It would take a little thought to represent the issue in accordance with WP:DUEWEIGHT, since the Sam Crane ''Useless Tree'' link in the Google Search above calls the distinction between GR ; SR "silly" while other good sources take it seriously.ch (talk) 04:29, 17 December 2015 (UTC)Hundred schools type articleIf people wanted to include developments of Confucianism (and it's predecessors in virtuous values) in this article it could become a hundred-schools type article.https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Administrative_Realism_in_Ancient_ChinaSemi-protected edit request on 5 November 2015;;Please insert a reference to the following article: , which regards a comparison between Legalism and Confucianism and their impact on Chinese politics and institutions, at the end of the first paragraph of the 'Politics' subsection of the 'Philosophy' section.;;Special:Contributions/91.182.199.7|91.182.199.7 (talk) 12:55, 5 November 2015 (UTC):File:Red question icon with gradient background.svg|20px|link= '''Not done:''' it's not clear what changes you want to be made.
