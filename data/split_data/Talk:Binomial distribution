ClarificationsIf you go to previous versions and look at the first one, 02/15/2001, which is yours?, you will see :1). q (1-p), maybe a typo?2). And the formula for the numbers of ways of picking X items out of N items  was:N!/X!/(N-X)!. This is plain wrong. Yes, after requesting a change for a week, I changed it.3).There were also wording problems. RoseParks.----I see now the problem. (1-p) was intended as a parenthetical definition. I guess N1/X!/(N-X)! worked in my programming codes so I couldn't see the ambiguity. How would you calculate N!/X!/(N-X)!? From right to left? On the other hand, Today is 02/20/2001, so I think your "requesting a change for a week" is a bit off. Today is only the 20th by my calendar. In any case, the criticism has led to something better.Dick Beldin----In answer to your question on how you evaluate, N!/X!/(X-N)!, this is ambiguous. In any easy example.2/4/12 is ambiguous since* (2/4)/12= 2/48=1/24 while* 2/(4/12)= 24/4= 6.Multiplication is associative over the reals. If you look at division as the inverse operation of multplication, i.e. 2/4/12=2*4^1*12^1=1/24 you are okay. If you look at division in the ordinary sense, you must specify the order of operations.RoseParks----I agree that an expression with successive divisions appears ambiguous. Most mathematicians I know do indeed consider division as the inverse of multiplication and many programming languages explicitly specify that multiplication and divisions are performed left to right. You are correct, it is not a universal convention. In addition, the vertical placement of numerator and denominator is clearer.Dick BeldinConfidence Interval?I was looking for information about confidence intervals on a binomial distribution, but was surprised not to find it here.  I know this case isn't quite as simple as for normal distributions, but it would be nice to have here, if somebody would like to contribute the information.You mean CI of p, the success probability, as estimated from the data.  If 70 successes in 100 trials, then p_est = 0.7, and your question is what is standard deviation of p_est. It is sqrt(p_est(1-p_est)/n_trials). The 95% confidence interval is +/- 2 standard deviations. My question is what happens if the CI range is outside the allowed 0 to 1 range for a probability. This can happen if p_est is ~1 or ~0. The CI has to be assymetric.  Any ideas?: In the case where the confidence interval gets close to 0 or 1, the normal approximation of the binomial distribution is not accurate and rules like your "2 standard deviations" that are derived from the normal distribution are not accurate either.  Depending on the circumstances, one can use a different approximation (such as the Poisson distribution) or the exact values of the binomial distribution. McKay 06:36, 27 October 2006 (UTC): Another intuitive understanding of confidence intervals on binomial distribution is this:  say you S success in N trials, now we don't know what p really is, but let's make a guess p_guess.  You can use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of seeing [S_observed or more success] in N trials if p=p_guess.  If S~N (p~1), there will be a value for p_guess so that there is only a 5% chance of getting S;=S_observed.  At this value for p_guess, you would say you are 95% confident that p;=p_guess.  Similarly if S~0.  For example if you did a trial with 45 samples (N=45) and all of them were successful (S=45), if p_guess=.95 there is only a 0.099 chance of seeing all 45 successful, so there you can be 1-0.099 =; 90% confident that p;=95%. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by Special:Contributions/64.122.234.42|64.122.234.42 (talk) 17:14, 11 April 2007 (UTC).;;;:: Yes, this is the kind of consideration I was shooting for with my original post.  While I understand adequately how to create a hypothesis test for a one-sided alternative, I was hoping that someone would come forward with a good methodology for doing a two-sided alternative hypothesis, since this would imply some means of parameterizing the asymmetry of the distribution.  I had this come up in a real-world scenario, where the  question was whether or not we had a statistically significant result, and how close it might actually be, but the interval was not so critical or well-defined.Simulation?I was looking for a pointer to quickly simulate a Binomial trial.  That is, given a p and an n, I want to randomly select a result with a Binomial distribution.  I know I can approximate this with a normal distribution, but I would prefer an exact result if it can be calculated quickly for n ; 10,000.  I'm sure others have come here looking as well.

The HIV part is just not encyclopedia-ish...:That might depend on which population. Michael Hardy 19:42, 22 October 2005 (UTC):Spot on. I thought exactly the same and immediately looked at the discussion. All political correctness aside, I just don't think anyone would feel harassed if we wrote "assume 5% of the population carry a certain gene" or "are infected with a certain desease", while I am very sure that everyone with an HIV-infection or someone who knows someone closely who is infected will at least feel strange on reading this paragraph. I am all against political correctness for its own sake, but if there's no need whatsoever to use a certain formulation that might be considered inappropriate, why use it?Probability mass function?Okay, maybe this is standard jargon somewhere, but I've never come across it until today. I guess "mass" makes sense by the physical analogy to density. Honestly, I think it's stupid language. Should we also speak of cumulative mass distribution functions? Be consistent! I'm not going to change it, but a mathematician should. At the very least link it to the pmf page.: pmf is fairly standard.  It is linked there now.

Sander123 13:58, 31 October 2007 (UTC)Relationship to Bezier curves?The article currently states: The formula for Bézier curves was inspired by the binomial distribution.;/I;Would someone care to source that statement? It seems rather dubious to me, but if it's true it's worthy of a proper  explanation and not the vague description of being "inspired by". Certainly the Bernstein polynomials, which constitute the basis functions for Béziers, contain a Binomial coefficient. But binomial coefficients exist all over the place. It doesn't necessarily imply that they have much at all to do with the Binomial ''distribution''.From reading about Bézier curves I've always had the impression that the decision to use Bersteins as their parametrization wasn't 'inspired' by anything, but merely ''chosen'' from a group of candidates on the merit of their desireable properties. (Being such properties as the fact that curve is guaranteed to be contained within the convex hull of the control points, that reversing the control points does not change the curve, that the tangents at the endpoints consist of the line between the endpoint and the neighboring control point, etc). --130.237.179.166 14:48, 3 September 2006 (UTC): I'm deleting this since no justification has been offered.  Zillions of things are "inspired" by the binomial distribution anyway and I don't see why this one is important enough to single out even if it is true.  McKay 04:31, 28 October 2006 (UTC)Better ExampleI feel like there could be a better example than picking 500 people out of a population "with replacement" and seeing how many were green-eyed.

Gerald Tros 01:41, 21 May 2007 (UTC)The example with a die is OK in principle. Most people, I reckon, will have seen and used dice. But why change the well known configuration ( 1 thru 6 dots) with "5 blank and 1 black side"? This now makes a familiar object ''unfamiliar'' and thus more difficult to mentally latch onto. Furthermore, a lesser issue, 'blank' and 'black' are two very similar words possibly leading to misreading. Why not just simply use: "Roll a die ten times and count the number of sixes.", thus appealing to a general feeling of wishing to see the highest value side turn up?

It began by saying "...we can see by Kitchen's Theorem that..." without having first said what "Kitchen's theorem" is.  That is not appropriate.  Then, as far as I can tell, the theorem turned out to be a proposition found in many textbooks without the name "Kitchen's theorem".  The notation in which it is written includes the use of the same letter for two different random variables in the same equality.  Near the bottom it has some notation that is less than correct and that includes some very clumsy language.  Then there is a signature---appropriate for a talk page but not for an article.  In includes "Dr. William Kitchen PhD (Psychology)", apparently identifying that person as the one who added this material.

Given the fact that my Theorom has went under rigorous investigation within a university, I fail to see how you can ever have seen it in "innumerable" textbooks. Perhaps you could name a few of them for my reference. And lets not get into a Mathematical jargon slanging match; whoever you are, I would be confident in my own Mathemaical standing to stand before anyone and prove my Theorem/ lemma. And, if it is indeed in many textbooks, I'd urge you to publish a proof of my statement. I have it on good authority, from highly esteemed Mathematicians, that the Theorem I put online is indeed a new and may I add correct proposition. It wasn't a Theorem as such, hence why I referred to it as the Binomial Lemma. I trust you know what a Lemma is! In future, before you make such claims, ensure that the nature of your statements is true. Do that rather than correcting me.

Was it mathematicians with expertise in probability theory saying the result is ''new'' and was unknown before you introduced it?  If so, I would find that surprising and I would dispute it.  Or was it a professor saying he did not happen to have seen it before?  If he's not a probabilist, that's not too surprising and is not the same as saying that it is novel.

And do not quote Wikipedia policy to me - take me to court, sue me, do whatever you wish. I have this Theorem in a journal, and have had it copyrighted to my name, so that scavengers on internet sites cannot attribute a novel idea to a text book they happen to have read. I had it checked, along with a proof by a university Professor who specialises in the concpets of probability and statisitics. It then underwent a stage of 'gaining plausibility', and under futher rigorous proof. There was a work through proof, and a proof by induction which clearly shows that the NEW theorem works, for all the possible values it outlines. I think you'll find the quote you have from your book involves a different concept to what I outlined before.

Like all Mathematicians, I like recognition for my work. I had to have it rigorously checked and compared with similar Theorems and Lemmas, to ensure I wasn't putting my name to a piece of work that someone else had previously discovered. Notation is a blunder, I hold my hands up on that front, and I understand the elementary nature of my error. I can provide you with my proof for the Theorem as soon as I finish my textbook which is in finalisation at the moment. All my work is momentarily on hold becasue of that. I welcome any scrutiny of my work - I feel that Mathematics is best done when under pressure from other esteemed Mathematicians. The workings of Wikipedia, however, are something I am not aware of, and I appreciate any guidelines you offer me to follow. Again, however, as I have already said, I know I can stand before any Mathematician and prove my Theorem.Regards Dr. William Kitchen:Hello Dr. William Kitchen, please try to relax a bit,  nobody is trying to discredit your work. But we are talking about cross purposes. What one wants for an encyclopedia article on the binomial distribution is the fact that it is related to the negative Binomial distribution. Ideally such a statement should be sourced. If appropriate a proof can be added. There where a number of problems however with your contribution and Michael rightly reversed it. The notation is problematic (using X twice, using r both as an index and a parameter). The proof doesn't add to this article since it doesn't actually ''prove'' the theorem, it only give some basic definition and a referral. And finally, the theorem quoted is unknown to mathematicians, so it doesn't help one at all.:In my view the statement related the two distribution can stay in the article. But the proof you supplied should either be replaced by a proper proof or by a reference to a published book or peer reviewed paper.:As one final point, please do not make legal threats.

Perhaps more important is that the normal approximation means that a great many statistical tests designed for the normal distribution (such as the Student ''t''-test, the ''F''-test) can also be used for the binomial distribution under the right conditions. --McKay 05:38, 1 April 2007 (UTC)Hmm, just a reader here, but I can't make a modern computer delay visually for any reasonable n (up to 9999999999) when using the exact solution.  I advise my students to always use the exact test and that the normal approximation is a relic of a bygone era.  However it is interesting and perhaps worth noting ''why'' the binomial becomes normal-ish.  Also, I thought the ability to use the normal approximation was based on np not n - with a low enough p, even a huge n will be skewed.4.79.81.6 04:45, 1 November 2007 (UTC)I experienced, that the normal approximation is indeed a time-saver if e.g. computing many different binomial distributions.

Melcombe (talk) 10:36, 24 November 2009 (UTC)Computing the cumulative distribution function (CDF)It's common in Wikipedia math articles to discuss algorithms for computing quantities of interest.  On this page it would be very helpful to have a discussion of computing the cumulative distribution function (CDF).  The article does mention various methods that can be used in various circumstances, but this is an incomplete solution at best.  For example, the article doesn't provide any guidance about choosing between (a) a combination of direct summation and the normal approximation and the poisson approximation, (b) a method based on the incomplete beta distribution, and (c) something else. A discussion of computing the CDF would be useful to a lot of people.

Any suggestions here to make this clearer how to use?:\begin{array}{*{20}{l}}(x) = {F_k}(x) + f(k)};{k \le x ; k + 1,\,\,k = 0,1,2,...,n - 1}\\(x) = 1};{x \ge n}\end{array}So if you make a sequence of the probabilities values (easy), you can easily make this into a sequence of n+2 points and then draw segments as in the above graphs.
