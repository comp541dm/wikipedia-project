'''Conjunction introduction''' (often abbreviated simply as '''conjunction''' and also called '''and introduction''') is a valid rule of inference of propositional logic. The rule makes it possible to introduce a conjunction into a logical proof. It is the inference that if the proposition ''p'' is true, and proposition ''q'' is true, then the logical conjunction of the two propositions ''p and q'' is true. For example, if it's true that it's raining, and it's true that I'm inside, then it's true that "it's raining and I'm inside". The rule can be stated::\frac{P,Q}{\therefore P \and Q}where the rule is that wherever an instance of "P" and "Q" appear on lines of a proof, a "P \and Q" can be placed on a subsequent line.Formal notationThe ''conjunction introduction'' rule may be written in sequent notation:: P, Q \vdash P \and Qwhere \vdash is a metalogical symbol meaning that P \and Q is a syntactic consequence if P and Q are each on lines of a proof in some logical system;where P and Q are propositions expressed in some formal system.References
