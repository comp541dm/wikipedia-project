The '''Antigonid dynasty''' (; ) was a dynasty of Hellenistic kings descended from Alexander the Great's general Antigonus I Monophthalmus ("the One-eyed").HistorySucceeding the Antipatrid dynasty in much of Macedonia, Antigonus ruled mostly over Asia Minor and northern Syria.  His attempts to take control of the whole of Alexander's empire led to his defeat and death at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC. Antigonus's son Demetrius I Poliorcetes survived the battle, and managed to seize control of Macedon itself a few years later, but eventually lost his throne, dying as a prisoner of Seleucus I Nicator. After a period of confusion, Demetrius's son Antigonus II Gonatas was able to establish the family's control over the old Kingdom of Macedon, as well as over most of the Greek city-states, by 276 BC.LegacyIt was one of four dynasties established by Alexander's successors, the others being the Seleucid dynasty, Ptolemaic dynasty and Attalid dynasty. The last scion of the dynasty, Perseus of Macedon, who reigned between 179-168 BC, proved unable to stop the advancing Roman legions and Macedon's defeat at the Battle of Pydna signaled the end of the dynasty.Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Antigonid dynasty'', 2008, O.Ed. But Perseus’ failure to deploy his full resources brought about his defeat (168) at Pydna in Macedonia and signaled the end of the dynasty."DynastyThe ruling members of the Antigonid dynasty were:{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellpadding="5" align="center" | style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto;"|+'''Antigonid Rulers'''!width="123px"|King !! align="center"  width="123px"|Reign (BCE) !! width="123px"|Consort(s) !! |Comments|-| Antigonus I Monophthalmus (Western Asian Antigonid kingdom)||306 BC – 301 BC || Stratonice |||-| Demetrius I Poliorcetes (Macedon, Cicilia) || 294 BC-287 BC || Phila  Ptolemais  Deidamia I of Epirus|Deïdameia  Lanassa  ?Eurydice  ?Unnamed Illyrian woman ||Phila was a daughter of Antipater, and ancestor of all subsequent Antigonid kings of Macedon, except Antigonus III Doson, through her son Antigonus II Gonatas.
