10 French centimes (1963)10 French centimes (1963)'''Centime''' (from centesimus) is French for "cent", and is used in English as the name of the fraction currency in several Francophone countries (including Switzerland, Algeria, Belgium, Morocco and France).In France the usage of ''centime'' goes back to the introduction of the decimal monetary system under Napoleon. This system aimed at replacing non-decimal fractions of older coins. A five-centime coin was known as a ''sou'', i.e. a solidus or shilling.In Francophone Canada 1/100 of a Canadian Dollar is officially known as a ''cent'' (pronounced /sɛnt/) in both English and French. However, in practice, the female form of ''cent'', ''cenne'' (pronounced /sɛn/) has completely replaced the official ''cent''. Spoken and written use of the official masculine form of ''cent'' in Francophone Canada is exceptionally uncommon.In the Canadian French vernacular ''sou'', ''sou noir'' (noir is the singular masculine form of the word black in French), ''cenne'', and ''cenne noire'' (noire is the singular feminine form of the word black in French) are all widely known, used, and accepted monikers when referring to either 1/100 of a Canadian Dollar or the 1¢ coin (colloquially known as a "penny" in North American English).Subdivision of euro: cent or centime?In the European community ''cent'' is the official name for one hundredth of a euro. However, in French-speaking countries the word ''centime '' is the preferred term. Indeed, the Conseil supérieur de la langue française (Belgium)|Superior Council of the French language of Belgium recommended in 2001 the use of ''centime'', since ''cent'' is also the French word for "hundred". An analogous decision was published in the ''Journal officiel'' in France (December 2, 1997).In Morocco, dirhams are divided into 100 ''centime''s and one may find prices in the country quoted in ''centime''s rather than in dirhams. Sometimes ''centime''s are known as francs or in former Spanish areas, pesetas.UsageA centime is one-hundredth of the following basic monetary units:Current* Algerian dinar* Burundian franc* CFP franc* CFA franc* Comorian franc* Congolese franc* Djiboutian franc* Ethiopian birr (as santim)* Guinean franc* Haitian gourde* Moroccan dirham* Rwandan franc* Swiss franc (by French speakers only, see Rappen)Obsolete* Algerian franc* Belgian franc* Cambodian franc* French Camerounian franc* French Guianan franc* French franc* Guadeloupe franc* Katangese franc* Latvian lats (Latvian: santīms)* Luxembourgish franc* Malagasy franc* Malian franc* Martinique franc* Monegasque franc* Moroccan franc* New Hebrides franc* Réunion franc* Spanish Peseta* Tunisian franc* Westphalian frankReferences
