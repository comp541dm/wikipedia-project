Courtney Love (band)'''Courtney Michelle Love''' (born '''Courtney Michelle Harrison''', July 9, 1964) is an American musician, actress, and visual artist. Prolific in the punk and grunge scenes of the 1990s as the frontwoman of Hole, Love became a fixture in alternative music, drawing public attention for her uninhibited stage presence and confrontational lyrics, as well as her highly publicized personal life following her marriage to Kurt Cobain.The daughter of psychotherapist Linda Carroll and Hank Harrison, Love had a nomadic early life; she mainly grew up in Oregon and California, where she was in a series of short-lived bands before landing roles in films by British director Alex Cox. After forming Hole in 1989, she received substantial attention from underground rock press for the group's debut album, produced by Kim Gordon, while the group's second release, ''Live Through This'' (1994), lent her a more high-profile renown, receiving critical accolades and going multi-platinum. In 1995, she returned to acting, earning a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance in Miloš Forman's ''The People vs. Larry Flynt'' (1996). Shortly after, Hole's third release, ''Celebrity Skin'' (1998), earned Love recognition as a mainstream musician, and was nominated for multiple Grammy Awards.Love continued to work as an actress, appearing in big-budget pictures such as ''Man on the Moon'' (1999) and ''Trapped'' (2002), and released her first solo album, ''America's Sweetheart'', in 2004. In 2010, she released ''Nobody's Daughter'' under the Hole moniker with a reformed band. Love debuted a new solo single in early 2014, and also saw a return to acting after appearing on multiple TV series, including ''Empire''.Early lifeLove was born Courtney Michelle Harrison on July 9, 1964, in San Francisco. Her mother, Linda Carroll (née Risi), was an employee at the UC San Francisco Hospital, and her father, Hank Harrison, was a publisher and road manager for the Grateful Dead. Love's mother had been adopted as a child, and was later revealed to be the biological daughter of novelist Paula Fox and an unidentified father, who is rumored to be Marlon Brando.

In 1985, she submitted an audition tape for the role of Nancy Spungen in the Sid Vicious biopic ''Sid and Nancy'' (1986), and was given a minor supporting role by director Alex Cox."kuchar1"After filming ''Sid and Nancy'' in New York City, Love worked at a peep show in Times Square and squatted at the ABC No Rio social center and Pyramid Club in the East Village. The same year, Cox cast her in a leading role in his following film, ''Straight to Hell'' (1987), a spaghetti western starring Joe Strummer and Grace Jones, which was filmed in Spain in 1986. The film caught the attention of Andy Warhol, who featured Love in an episode of ''Andy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes'' with Robbie Nevil in a segment titled "C'est la Vie". She also had a part in the 1988 Ramones music video for "I Wanna Be Sedated", appearing as a bride among dozens of party guests.In 1988, Love aborted her acting career and left New York, returning to the west coast, citing the "celebutante" fame she'd attained as the central reason. "I hated it," she recalled. "It was misery itself.""vh1"She returned to stripping in the small town of McMinnville, Oregon, where she was recognized by customers at the bar;"vh1"this prompted Love to go into isolation, and she relocated to Anchorage, Alaska: "I decided to move to Alaska because I needed to get my shit together and learn how to work," Love said in retrospect. "So I went on this sort of vision quest. I got rid of all my earthly possessions. I had my bad little strip clothes and some big sweaters, and I moved into a trailer with a bunch of other strippers."1988–1991: Beginnings of HoleLove performing with Hole, 1989Hole (band)At the end of 1988, Love taught herself to play guitar and relocated to Los Angeles, where she placed an ad in a local music zine, reading: "I want to start a band. My influences are Big Black, Sonic Youth, and Fleetwood Mac." Love recruited lead guitarist Eric Erlandson; Lisa Roberts, her neighbor, as bassist; and drummer Caroline Rue, whom she met at a Gwar concert."first"Love named the band Hole after a line from Euripedes' ''Medea'', as well as a conversation she'd had with her mother, in which she told her that she "couldn't walk around with a hole inside herself."Love continued to work at strip clubs in the band's formative stages, saving money to purchase a backline and a touring van. Hole played their first show in November 1989 at Raji's, a rock club in central Hollywood. The band's debut single, "Retard Girl", was issued in April 1990 through the Long Beach indie label Sympathy for the Record Industry, and was given air-time by Rodney Bingenheimer's local station, KROQ."etrue"That fall, the band appeared on the cover of ''Flipside'', a Los Angeles-based punk fanzine."first"In the spring of 1991, the band released their second single, "Dicknail" through Sub Pop Records.With no wave, noise rock and grindcore bands being major influences on Love,"first"Hole's first studio album, ''Pretty on the Inside'', captured a particularly abrasive sound and contained disturbing lyrics, described by ''Q magazine'' as "confrontational [and] genuinely uninhibited."Q Magazine Review: Pretty on the Inside by Hole. 1995–10. p. 138 The record was released in September 1991 on Caroline Records, produced by Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, with assistant production from Gumball's Don Fleming. Though Love would later say it was "unlistenable" and "[un]melodic", the album received generally positive critical reception from indie and punk rock critics and was labeled one of the twenty best albums of the year by ''Spin Magazine''. It also gained a following in the United Kingdom, charting at 59 on the UK Albums Chart, FfnOji_bk_M as well as its lead single, "Teenage Whore" entering the country's indie chart at number one.  The underlying feminist slant of the album's songs led many to mistakenly tag the band as being part of the riot grrl movement, a movement that Love did not associate with. In support of the record, the band toured in Europe headlining with Mudhoney, and extensively in the United States opening for The Smashing Pumpkins."cromelin"They also performed at the Whisky A Go Go opening for Sonic Youth,2008 and at CBGB in New York City.

During Love's pregnancy, Hole recorded a cover of "Over the Edge" for a Wipers tribute album, and recorded their fourth single, "Beautiful Son", which was released in April 1993.

The album featured a new lineup, with bassist Kristen Pfaff and drummer Patty Schemel. ''Live Through This'' was released on Geffen's subsidiary DGC label in April 1994, four days after Love's husband, Cobain, was found dead of a self-inflicted shotgun wound in their home. Two months later, in June 1994, bassist Kristen Pfaff died of a heroin overdose,"vh1"and Love recruited Melissa Auf der Maur for the band's impending tour.

The success of the record combined with Cobain's suicide resulted in a high level of publicity for Love, and she was featured on Barbara Walters' ''10 Most Fascinating People'' in 1995. At Hole's performance of August 26, 1994 at the Reading Festival— Love's first public performance following her husband's death— she appeared onstage, tear-drenched, with outstretched arms, mimicking crucifixion. John Peel wrote in ''The Guardian'' that Love's disheveled appearance "would have drawn whistles of astonishment in Bedlam", and that her performance "verged on the heroic... Love steered her band through a set which dared you to pity either her recent history or that of the band... the band teetered on the edge of chaos, generating a tension which I cannot remember having felt before from any stage." The band performed a series of riotous concerts during the tour, with Love frequently appearing hysterical onstage, flashing crowds, and getting into fights with audience members."aaron spin"In February 1995, Hole performed a well-reviewed acoustic set on ''MTV Unplugged'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and continued to tour late into the year, concluding their world tour with an appearance at the 1995 ''MTV Video Music Awards'', where they were nominated for Best Alternative Video for "Doll Parts".1996–2000: Acting and mainstream successAfter Hole's world tour concluded in 1996, Love made a return to acting; first in small roles in ''Basquiat'' and ''Feeling Minnesota'' (1996), before landing the co-starring role of Larry Flynt's wife, Althea, in Miloš Forman's critically acclaimed 1996 film ''The People vs. Larry Flynt''.  Despite Columbia Pictures' reluctance toward hiring Love due to her "troubled" past, she received critical acclaim for her performance in the film after its release in December 1996, earning a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress, and a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress. Roger Ebert called her work in the film "quite a performance; Love proves she is not a rock star pretending to act, but a true actress." She won several other awards from various film critic associations for the film, and consequently adopted a more polished public image; during this time, she also became involved in fashion and modeled for Versace advertisements.In late 1997, Hole released a compilation album, ''My Body, the Hand Grenade'' as well as an EP titled ''The First Session'' which consisted of the band's earliest recordings. In September 1998, Hole released their third studio album, ''Celebrity Skin'', which marked something of a transformation for Love, featuring a stark power pop sound as opposed to the group's earlier punk rock influences."int"Love divulged her ambition of making an album where "art meets commerce... there are no compromises made, it has commercial appeal, and it sticks to the [our] original vision.""int"She said she was influenced by Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac, and My Bloody Valentine when writing the album. ''Celebrity Skin'' was well received by critics; ''Rolling Stone'' called the album "accessible, fiery and intimate—often at the same time... a basic guitar record that's anything but basic." ''Celebrity Skin'' went on to go multi-platinum, and topped "Best of Year" lists at ''Spin'' and the ''Village Voice''. The album garnered the band their only No.1 hit single on the Modern Rock Tracks chart with the title track "Celebrity Skin." The band made various appearances promoting the album, including MTV performances and at the 1998 Billboard Music Awards. Hole toured with Marilyn Manson on the Beautiful Monsters Tour in 1999, but dropped out of the tour nine dates in after a dispute over production costs between Love and Manson; Hole resumed touring with Imperial Teen.Prior to the release and promotion of ''Celebrity Skin'', Love and Fender designed a low-priced Squier brand guitar, called Vista Venus. The instrument featured a shape inspired by Mercury, Stratocaster, and Rickenbacker's solidbodies and had a single-coil and a humbucker pickup, and was available in 6-string and 12-string versions. In an early 1999 interview, Love said about the Venus: "I wanted a guitar that sounded really warm and pop, but which required just one box to go dirty... And something that could also be your first band guitar. I didn't want it all teched out. I wanted it real simple, with just one pickup switch." In 1999, Love was awarded an Orville H. Gibson award for Best Female Rock Guitarist. During this time, she also landed a role opposite Jim Carrey in the Andy Kaufman biopic ''Man on the Moon'' (1999), which was followed with a role as William S. Burroughs's wife Joan Vollmer in ''Beat'' (2000) alongside Kiefer Sutherland.After touring for ''Celebrity Skin'' finished, Auf der Maur left the band to tour with the Smashing Pumpkins; Hole's touring drummer Samantha Maloney left soon after. Love and Erlandson released the single "Be A Man"— an outtake from the ''Celebrity Skin'' sessions— for the soundtrack of the Oliver Stone film ''Any Given Sunday'' (1999). The group became dormant in the following two years, and Love starred in several more films, including leading role in ''Julie Johnson'' (2001) as Lili Taylor's lesbian lover, for which she won an Outstanding Actress award at L.A.'s Outfest, and another leading part in the thriller ''Trapped'' (2002), alongside Kevin Bacon and Charlize Theron. In May 2002, Hole officially announced their breakup amid continuing litigation with Universal Music Group over their record contract.2001–2011: Solo work, Hole revivalWith Hole in disarray, Love began a "punk rock femme supergroup" called Bastard during autumn 2001, enlisting Schemel, Veruca Salt co-frontwoman Louise Post, and bassist Gina Crosley. Though a demo was completed, the project never reached fruition.Love performing in London, 2007In 2002, Love began composing an album with Linda Perry, titled ''America's Sweetheart'', also reuniting with drummer Patty Schemel. Love signed with Virgin Records to release it, and initially recorded it in France, but was forced by the label to re-record the entire album in the summer of 2003. ''America's Sweetheart'' was released in February 2004, and received mixed reviews from critics. Charles Aaron of ''Spin'' called it a "jaw-dropping act of artistic will and a fiery, proper follow-up to 1994's ''Live Through This''" and awarded it eight out of ten stars, while ''The Village Voice'' said: "[Love is] willing to act out the dream of every teenage brat who ever wanted to have a glamorous, high-profile hissyfit, and she turns those egocentric nervous breakdowns into art. Sure, the art becomes less compelling when you've been pulling the same stunts for a decade. But, honestly, is there anybody out there who fucks up better?" The album sold less than 100,000 copies. Love has publicly expressed her regret over the record several times, calling it "a crap record" and reasoning that her drug issues at the time were to blame. Shortly after the record was released, Love told Kurt Loder on TRL: "I cannot exist as a solo artist. It's a joke." Love also collaborated on a manga comic titled ''Princess Ai'', illustrated by Misaho Kujiradou and Ai Yazawa, which was released in July 2004.In 2006, Love released a memoir, titled ''Dirty Blonde'',2007 and started recording what was going to be her second solo album, ''How Dirty Girls Get Clean'',"returnclove"collaborating again with Perry and Billy Corgan in the writing and recording. Love had written several songs, including an anti-cocaine song titled "Loser Dust", during her time in rehab in 2005. She told ''Billboard'': "My hand-eye coordination was so bad [after the drug use], I didn't even know chords anymore. It was like my fingers were frozen. And I wasn't allowed to make noise [in rehab]... I never thought I would work again." Some tracks and demos from the album (initially planned for release in 2008) were leaked on the internet in 2006, and a documentary entitled ''The Return of Courtney Love'', detailing the making of the album, aired on the British television network in the fall of that year. A rough acoustic version of "Never Go Hungry Again", recorded during an interview for ''The Times'' in November, was also released. Incomplete audio clips of the song "Samantha", originating from an interview with NPR, were also distributed on the internet in 2007.File:Courtney Love and Terry Richardson.jpg|thumb|right|Love attending New York Fashion Week in 2011, photographed with Terry RichardsonOn June 17, 2009, ''NME'' reported that Hole would be reuniting. Former Hole guitarist Erlandson stated in ''Spin'' magazine that contractually no reunion can take place without his involvement; therefore ''Nobody's Daughter'' would remain Love's solo record, as opposed to a "Hole" record. Love responded to Erlandson's comments in a Twitter post, claiming "he's out of his mind, Hole is my band, my name, and my Trademark". ''Nobody's Daughter'' was released worldwide as a Hole album on April 27, 2010. For the new line-up, Love recruited guitarist Micko Larkin, Shawn Dailey (bass guitar), and Stu Fisher (drums, percussion). ''Nobody's Daughter'' featured a great deal of material written and recorded for Love's aborted solo album, ''How Dirty Girls Get Clean'', including "Pacific Coast Highway", "Letter to God", "Samantha", and "Never Go Hungry", although they were re-produced with Larkin. The first single from ''Nobody's Daughter'' was "Skinny Little Bitch", which became a hit on alternative rock radio in early March 2010.The album received mixed reviews. Robert Sheffield of ''Rolling Stone'' gave the album three out of five stars, saying that Love "worked hard on these songs, instead of just babbling a bunch of druggy bullshit and assuming people would buy it, the way she did on her 2004 flop, ''America's Sweetheart''." Sal Cinquemani of ''Slant Magazine'' also gave the album three out of five stars, saying "It's Marianne Faithfull's substance-ravaged voice that comes to mind most often while listening to songs like "Honey" and "For Once in Your Life." The latter track is, in fact, one of Love's most raw and vulnerable vocal performances to date... the song offers a rare glimpse into the mind of a woman who, for the last 15 years, has been as famous for being a rock star as she's been for being a victim." The album's subject matter was largely centered on Love's tumultuous life between 2003 and 2007, and featured a polished folk-rock sound with significantly more acoustic work than previous Hole albums. Love and the band toured internationally from 2010 into late 2012 promoting the record, after which she dropped the Hole name and returned to a solo career.2012–present: Career expansionIn May 2012, Love debuted an art collection at Fred Torres Collaborations in New York titled "''And She's Not Even Pretty''", which contained over forty drawings and paintings by Love composed in ink, colored pencil, pastels, and watercolors. She then collaborated with Michael Stipe on the track "Rio Grande" for Johnny Depp's sea shanty album ''Son of Rogues Gallery'' and also contributed guest vocals and co-wrote a track on Fall Out Boy's album, ''Save Rock and Roll'' (2013).File:Courtney Love Sept 2013 NYC.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Love performing at Dream Downtown in Chelsea, Manhattan, New York City, September 2013After solo performances in December 2012 and January 2013, Love appeared in advertisements for Yves Saint Laurent alongside Kim Gordon and Ariel Pink. Love completed a solo tour of North America in the summer of 2013, which had initially been conceived to promote Love's new album; however, due to the impending release of new material, it was dubbed a "greatest hits" tour. Love told ''Billboard'' at the time that she had recorded eight songs in the studio. "[These songs] are not my usual (style)," Love said. "I don't have any Fleetwood Mac references on it. Usually I always have a Fleetwood Mac reference as well as having, like, Big Black references. These are very unique songs that sort of magically happened.""USAtoday"On April 22, 2014, Love debuted the song "You Know My Name" on BBC Radio 6 to promote her tour of the United Kingdom. It was released as a double A-side single with the song "Wedding Day" on May 4, 2014 on her own label Cherry Forever Records via Kobalt Label Services. The tracks were produced by Michael Beinhorn, and feature Tommy Lee on drums. In an interview with BBC, Love revealed that she and former Hole guitarist Eric Erlandson had reconciled, and had been rehearsing new material together, along with former bassist Melissa Auf der Maur and drummer Patty Schemel, though did not confirm a reunion of the band. On May 1, 2014, in an interview with ''Pitchfork'', Love commented further on the possibility of Hole reuniting, saying:"I'm not going to commit to it happening, because we want an element of surprise. There's a lot of i's to be dotted and t's to be crossed."In July 2014, Love landed a minor role on the final season of the FX series ''Sons of Anarchy'' which began filming in the summer, and also appeared in a recurring role on the series ''Revenge''. Love also landed a leading role in "Kansas City Choir Boy", a collaborative "pop opera" which showed at the Manhattan arts center Here during their annual ''Prototype'' festival in January 2015. She was subsequently cast in Lee Daniels' network series ''Empire'' in a recurring guest role as Elle Dallas. The track "Walk Out on Me" featuring Love was included on the ''Empire: Original Soundtrack from Season 1'' album, which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200. Love's contribution to the album was critically acclaimed."empire21"''The Guardian'' praised the track, saying: "The idea of Courtney Love singing a ballad with a group of gospel singers seems faintly terrifying...The reality is brilliant. Love’s voice fits the careworn lyrics, effortlessly summoning the kind of ravaged darkness that Lana Del Rey nearly ruptures herself trying to conjure up."In the spring of 2015, Love joined Lana Del Rey on her Endless Summer Tour with eight show performances. During her tenure on Del Rey's tour, Love debuted a new single, "Miss Narcissist", released on Wavves' independent label Ghost Ramp. She also was cast in a supporting role in James Franco's film ''The Long Home'', based on William Gay's novel of the same name, marking her first film role in over ten years. In January 2016, Love released a clothing line in collaboration with Sophia Amoruso titled "Love, Courtney," featuring eighteen pieces inspired by Love's iconic style over the course of her career.Musical styleSongwritingIt was remarked in an October 1991 ''Spin'' review of Hole's first album that Love's layering of harsh and abrasive riffs buried more sophisticated musical arrangements. In 1998, Love stated that Hole had "always been a pop band. We always had a subtext of pop. I always talked about it, if you go back... what'll sound like some weird Sonic Youth tuning back then to you was sounding like the Raspberries to me, in my demented pop framework"."int"Love writes from a female's point of view, and her lyrics have been described as "literate and mordant" and noted by scholars for "articulating a third-wave feminist consciousness." She has repeatedly stated that lyrics are the most important component of songwriting for her, saying: "I want it to look just as good on the page as it would if it was in a poetry book". A great deal of her songwriting has been diaristic in nature."vh1"Hole interviewed at Big Day Out tour (1999). ''Ground Zero''.  Common themes present in Love's songs during her early career included body image, rape, suicide, conformity, elitism, pregnancy, prostitution, and death. In a 1991 interview with Everett True, Love said: "I try to place [beautiful imagery] next to fucked up imagery, because that's how I view things... I sometimes feel that no one's taken the time to write about certain things in rock, that there's a certain female point of view that's never been given space". Her later work was more lyrically introspective. ''Celebrity Skin'' and ''America's Sweetheart'' deal with celebrity life, Hollywood, and drug addiction, while continuing Love's interest in vanity and body image. ''Nobody's Daughter'' was lyrically reflective of Love's past relationships and her struggle to sobriety, with the majority of its lyrics having been written while she was in rehab in 2006. Poetry has often been a major influence on her writing; Love said she had "always wanted to be a poet, but there was no money in it." She has named the work of T.S. Eliot and Charles Baudelaire as influential."superrock"Voice and instrumentsLove possesses a contralto vocal range, and her vocal style has been described as "raw and distinctive." She has referred to herself as "a shit guitar player", further commenting: "I can write a song, but I have trouble with the execution of it". According to Love, she never wanted to be a singer, but rather aspired to be a skilled guitarist: "I'm such a lazy bastard though that I never did that", Love said. "I was always the only person with the nerve to sing, and so I got stuck with it"."superrock"She has been regularly noted by critics for her husky vocals as well as her "banshee[-like]" screaming abilities. Her vocals have been compared to those of Johnny Rotten, and David Fricke of ''Rolling Stone'' described them as "lung-busting" and "a corrosive, lunatic wail"."rotten"Upon the release of Hole's 2010 album, ''Nobody's Daughter'', Amanda Petrusich of Pitchfork compared Love's raspy, unpolished vocals to those of Bob Dylan.Love has often played Fender guitars throughout her career, including a Jaguar and a vintage 1965 Jazzmaster, the latter of which was purchased by the Hard Rock Cafe and is on display in New York City."jazzmaster"Love is seen playing her Jazzmaster in the music video for "Miss World."

In reflecting on their relationship, Love said: "I think that it looked like it was headed for doom, but it didn't feel like it was headed for doom on a daily basis. We went mountain biking; we would go camping. We were damn normal." After his cremation, Love divided portions of Cobain's ashes, some of which she kept in a teddy bear and in an urn.

In the letter, Love stated: "It's not piracy when kids swap music over the Internet using Napster or Gnutella or Freenet or iMesh or beaming their CDs into a My.MP3.com or MyPlay.com music locker.

Love participated with Linda Perry for the event again in 2012, relating her experiences as a nomadic teenager and having to live on the street: This really resonates with me, [because] I was a kid from Oregon, and I came to Hollywood like a lot of people do, and you know, what happens is that we end up on the street... and if you're gay, or lesbian, or transgendered— the more "outside" you are, the more screwed you are in a lot of ways... Seven thousand kids in Los Angeles a year go out on the street, and forty percent of those kids are gay, lesbian, or transgendered. They come out to their parents, and become homeless. [The charity helps them] get sent to the right foster care, they can get medical help, food, clothing... and for whatever reason, I don't really know why, but gay men have a lot of foundations, I've played many of them— but the lesbian side of it doesn't have as much money and/or donors, so we're excited that this has grown to cover women and women's affairs.;/blockquote;Cultural impactFile:Courtney Love Street Art Dublin.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Love featured in a piece of street art in Dublin, IrelandLove had a significant impact on female-fronted alternative acts and performers, particularly the Riot grrrl movement, with Hole's first album, ''Pretty on the Inside''. She has been cited as particularly influential to young female instrumentalists, once infamously proclaiming: "I want every girl in the world to pick up a guitar and start screaming."2004 "I strap on that motherfucking guitar and you cannot fuck with me. That's my feeling," she said. In ''The Electric Guitar: A History of an American Icon'', it is noted that,  ''Time'' deemed Hole's ''Live Through This'' to be supplemented by "primal guitar riffs and high-IQ lyrics." Having sold over 3 million records in the United States alone,As of 2003, ''Pretty on the Inside'' had sold over 200,000 copies in the U.S.; ''Live Through This'', 1,600,000; ''Celebrity Skin'', 1,400,000. Hole became one of the most successful rock bands of all time fronted by a woman. In 2015, the ''Phoenix New Times'' declared Love the no. 1 greatest female rock star of all time, saying: "To build a perfect rock star, there are several crucial ingredients: musical talent, physical attractiveness, tumultuous relationships, substance abuse, and public meltdowns, just to name a few. These days, Love seems to have rebounded from her epic tailspin and has leveled out in a slightly more normal manner, but there's no doubt that her life to date is the type of story people wouldn't believe in a novel or a movie."Among the alternative musicians who have cited Love as an influence are: Scout Niblett; Brody Dalle of The Distillers; Dee Dee Penny of Dum Dum Girls; and Nine Black Alps. Contemporary female pop artists Lana Del Rey, Avril Lavigne, Tove Lo, and Sky Ferreira have also cited Love as an influence. Love has frequently been recognized as the most high-profile contributor of feminist music during the 1990s, and for "subverting [the] mainstream expectations of how a woman should look, act, and sound." According to music journalist Maria Raha, "Whether you love Courtney [Love] or hate her, Hole was the highest-profile female-fronted band of the '90s to openly and directly sing about feminism." She has also been noted as a gay icon since the mid-1990s, and has jokingly referred to her fanbase as consisting of "females, gay guys, and a few advanced, evolved heterosexual men".Love's aesthetic image, particularly in the early 1990s, also became influential, and was dubbed "kinderwhore" by critics and media. The subversive fashion mainly consisted of thrift shop babydoll dresses accompanied by smeared makeup and red lipstick; MTV reporter Kurt Loder described Love as looking like "a debauched rag doll" onstage.2008 Love later said she had been influenced by the fashion of Chrissy Amphlett of the Divinyls.The artist Barbara Kruger used one of Love's quotes on her NYC bus project. Indie pop punk band The Muffs named their second album, ''Blonder and Blonder'' (1995) after a quote by Love, and a recording of Love talking about a stolen dress appears as the track "Love" on the band's 2000 compilation album ''Hamburger''. There is also a band named after her.DiscographyCourtney Love discography; Hole* ''Pretty on the Inside'' (1991)* ''Live Through This'' (1994)* ''Celebrity Skin'' (1998)* ''Nobody's Daughter'' (2010); Courtney Love* ''America's Sweetheart'' (2004)FilmographyCourtney Love filmography{| class="wikitable sortable" style="min-width:30em"|-! colspan=7 | Feature films|-!
