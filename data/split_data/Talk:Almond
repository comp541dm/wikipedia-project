Rather than the usual American pronunciation of "Ahl-mond", with the soft A and L, it is pronounced with a hard A and nearly silent H, as in "Aah-men". This method of pronunciation is particularly prevalent near the city of Chico in Butte County, but it is also heard in nearby Glenn, Colusa, and Tehama Counties.OK, well the more linguistic training you have, the less meaningful descriptions like this become. What do "hard" and "soft" A refer to? Is there any actual /h/ in "Aah-men", or is that just a convention to indicate the quality of the a?Is there any chance that someone in the know could get this transcribed into IPA? Thanks. --Iustinus 17:39, 2 February 2006 (UTC):I don't know IPA, but as resident of the area, I can try to answer the question.  I don't think there is an actual "h" sound in the pronunciation.  The "Aah" sound described above should be like the "a" in "cat".  I would write it phonetically as "a'-men". (putting a strong emphasis on the "a"). This pronunciation is only common among almond-farming families and orchard workers who use word "almond" hundreds or thousand of times per year. It's an informal, abreviated form of the word, dropping the "L" and the "d" sounds, and changing the initial vowel sound from the "o" in "odd-ball", to "a" as in "apple".  Curiously, this pronunciation only seems to apply to almonds until they are harvested and processed.  In the context of food, an "almond joy" candy-bar for example, even an almond farmer would be more likely to use the common (non-regional) pronunciation.  --Michaelfavor 00:08, 3 February 2006 (UTC)::The use of an 'h' in a pronunciation guide means a voiced 'h', i.e., aspiration (here, as in e.g. the Arabic name ''Ahmed'').

You should be able to copy the IPA notation for the 'Am' sound from those words.

This is an almond joke that growers tell referring to the knocking of the trees with mallets in order to shake the almonds from the tree. (today it's done with tree shakers)** The "Non-Pareil" variety is a soft shell variety and seems to make up the vast majority of almonds here in central California.  I am surprised the article does not mention or illustrate soft shell varieties.  It leads poople to believe most are hard as the ones they see in-shell at the market are all hard shell.  The NonPareil (if I have the spelling right) apparently means without equal and is the name of a specific variety that has been very sucessful.  There is no "Pareil" version. There are dozens of other varieties, most of them minor, I have seen them and recorded their names as a huller operator decades ago.  The soft shell shell is flimsy, more like paper or light cardboard, sometimes suseptical to soil and mold and can be easily opened by an adult hand.  The hardshell are more perfect looking, hard, and uniform in light color.  I can confirm that the old locals and local farmers here pronounce it "æ.mund", but those raised on TV or who grew up in more advanced parts of the state are more likely to pronounce it more like the Almond Joy commercials do.

Other possibilities occur to me. An almond is a seed, the bulk of which is formed by endosperm (I guess triploid in ''Prunus'' but I'm not sure). Endosperm is formed by double fertilization in which two male gametes fuse with female gamete. Thus, genetically, endosperm is very influenced by the male parent (although which genes get expressed is another matter). Thus bitterness ''could'' be due to fertilization by pollen from bitter almond cultivars, or perhaps wild plants in the right area. The point is that we can all think up possible mechanisms; what we really need is to find something in a refereed research journal or reliable botanical textbook.:::::The philosopher Wittgenstein once wrote (in a different context!) about the futility of trying to verify something by reading more copies of the same newspaper.

Peter coxhead (talk) 11:25, 12 April 2011 (UTC)I'd be reasonably confident that if a sweet almond tree was grafted onto bitter almond root stock, foliage could grow below the graft and would thus produce bitter almonds from that part of the tree.

Several sources contradict this, noting that increased demand is the primary factor behind higher prices.  in the Boston Globe states, "Enthusiastic almond adopters [...] are pushing demand for almond milk — and the nut itself — to historic heights. Add in an insatiable almond appetite in China and you have a recipe for both skyrocketing demand and rising prices [...]." And  on almonds and walnuts in The Produce News includes this paragraph: "So why are the prices of some nut varieties so high? 'It’s world demand,' DeFranco said. Demand is so strong from foreign countries that almond and walnut processors 'could ship everything export and I don’t think it would be a hindrance on their business.'" Therefore, I propose that the line in the article be changed to something like this: "Since 2013, rising demand for almonds has contributed to higher prices worldwide."I'm making the suggestion here without editing the page myself as I am not NPOV on almonds. I work for an agency that supports the Almond Board of California's communications team.

But I want to know total production without the shells. (I'm just curious what share of the almonds I personally am eating.) If anyone can find a good source for how the mass of the shell typically compares to the mass of the almond that would help estimate.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/75.165.37.22|75.165.37.22 (talk) 03:32, 27 February 2015 (UTC);;; ;;External links modifiedHello fellow Wikipedians,I have just added archive links to 1 external links on Almond.
