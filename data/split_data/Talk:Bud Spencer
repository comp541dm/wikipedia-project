One sentenseOne sentence originally read: After a successful education and leaving the university with a doctor degree in law" etc.  I took the "sucessful education" bit out as a doctorate in anything probably indicates to most people that the person has been successfully educated.  :-)DoctorateAn Italian doctorate is a first degree, nothing more...wrong, in Italy one who get the bachelor degree is called "doctor" but doctorate is just like in U.K. or U.S. (generally three years after master degree)Olympic swimmerAre you sure Bud Spencer was an olympic Swimmer?? ;-) WPWell, I read the Olympics information in two seperate sources. He has earned a respectable 11th degree, so it is difficult to check that in general Olympics pages ErdemTuzun.CopyeditI notice that "Banana Joe" and "They called him Bulldozer" have been listed as movies that star both Hill and Spencer. However they only starred Spencer himself. Confusion may have arisen because these moves are part of the Hill/Spencer collection.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/203.167.211.73|203.167.211.73 (talk) 20:56, 19 October 2008 (UTC);; ;;:Wondering if the separate numbered list of Hill/Spencer movies ought to be incorporated into the Filmography section as some sort of notation/separate column in the table? It just repeats information, anyway.--TLein (talk) 07:56, 29 July 2009 (UTC)Place of birthThe English and the Italian version of this page respectively list Vico Equense and Naples as the places of birth for the actor. Something needs to be fixed. The two places cannot show up at the same time on two versions of the same article.ICE77 -- 84.223.77.41 14:07, 6 August 2007 (UTC)Bud Spencer like popeye the sailor man  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/92.82.126.149|92.82.126.149 (talk) 18:34, 28 August 2010 (UTC);; ;;Bud Spencer like popeye the sailor manBravo...  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/92.82.126.149|92.82.126.149 (talk) 18:36, 28 August 2010 (UTC);; ;;Bud Spencer like popeye the sailor manBravo...it's a good idea  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/92.82.126.149|92.82.126.149 (talk) 18:41, 28 August 2010 (UTC);; ;;Mafia: Farewell to the Godfather''2011 - Mafia: Farewell to the Godfather - Angelo Aliveri''Is there a proof that Mafia movie is actually being filmed? There is no proof of it and there is even a clip on youtube with Bud denying any involvement in any similar project (Here in Croatia (director is Croatian, an Mafia is supposed to be shot in Croatia) this movie is speculated to be a hoax.I will remove this entry from Bud Spencer wiki page, if you disagree and have proof this movie exists, return it.--Beno HR (talk) 19:05, 17 April 2011 (UTC)Schwäbisch GmündApparently Spencer competed in Schwäbisch Gmünd in 1951 and 1954. The city has a new auto tunnel that they solicited names, and Bud Spencer's name appeared with uprising support. ---'''''—User:Gadget850|Gadget850(Ed)'''''''talk'' 11:48, 30 July 2011 (UTC)
