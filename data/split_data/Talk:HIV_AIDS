;;;;;;__TOC__Rationale for naming of articleHi, I searched the archives and I noticed that "HIV disease" as a name for this article has been mentioned, although I can't seem to find an organized discussion with arguments for and against HIV/AIDS as the name of this article. "HIV disease" is the term used in the ICD-10 and ICD-9, hence why I'd like to see what the other side of the argument for HIV/AIDS as the title of this article was when this decision was made. Btw it is also worthwhile noting that HIV disease redirects to HIV and not to this article.

User:Doc James|'''Doc James''' (talk · Special:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · Special:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 00:55, 11 March 2015 (UTC)The lead needs to mention treatment as preventionIn the current version of the article the lead says "Prevention of HIV infection, primarily through safe sex and needle-exchange programs, is a key strategy to control the spread of the disease." Ten or fifteen years ago safe sex and needle exchange programs may have been the primary strategies for HIV prevention but a lot has happened since then. In recent years there has been a bit of a paradigm shift in terms of priorities as studies such as HPTN 052 confirmed that early initiation of antiretroviral treatment greatly reduces the chance of HIV transmission. The concept of treatment as prevention (also called TasP) is well explained in . UNAIDS considers TasP to be a key element in HIV prevention. The Executive Director of UNAIDS, commented on theHPTN 052 study::"This breakthrough is a serious game changer and will drive the prevention revolution forward. It makes HIV treatment a new priority prevention option." (Source: [UNAIDS])In the context to their ambitious 90/90/90 target for 2020, UNAIDS says::“Antiretroviral therapy is projected to account for 60% of infections prevented through scale-up of these priority strategies.” (Source: )and in 2012 the WHO released a publication of treatment as prevention and states::"It is certain that TasP needs to be considered as a key element of combination HIV prevention and as a major part of the solution to ending the HIV epidemic." (Source: [WHO])Would one of you be so kind to edit the lead accordingly?

Chakalacka (talk) 02:02, 6 April 2015 (UTC)"Nukes" and "Non-nukes"If these 2 words do not appear in this HIV/AIDS article... the Tx of this disease hasn't been sufficiently covered! Special:Contributions/182.255.99.214|182.255.99.214 (talk) 07:24, 13 June 2015 (UTC):Well, if you know what those two words stand for you'll see that NRTIs and NNRTIs are indeed covered by the article. I see no reason why an encyclopedia has to mention such informal terms from the old days... Chakalacka (talk) 22:47, 25 June 2015 (UTC)::The terms "Nukes" and "Non-nukes" are still widely used in clinical discussions. Not sure where slang would go in this article, but if there's a place for it then these terms are as important for understanding the vernacular as any. ;mdash; soupvector (talk) 21:14, 21 November 2015 (UTC)Semi-protected edit request on 17 June 2015;;Please add "A study of African American women residing in the United States found that level of education, access to health care coverage, and having recently engaged in high-risk activities increase the likelihood of getting tested for HIV. Conversely, the same study found that a woman's age and marital status can lower the likelihood that a woman get tested for HIV." to the section on HIV Testing.Source:Morooka, H., ; Lampkins, A.

If you want to add this information, then perhaps HIV/AIDS in the United States would be the best place. That article is not locked so you can add it yourself. User:Bluerasberry|''' Blue Rasberry '''User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 19:14, 17 June 2015 (UTC)PotentThis word has multiple meanings which makes it confusing. Thus IMO we should use the term "very effective" or some other term instead. Peoples thoughts?
