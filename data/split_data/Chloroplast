Their discovery inside plant cells is usually credited to Julius von Sachs (1832–1897), an influential botanist and author of standard botanical textbooks – sometimes called "The Father of Plant Physiology".Chloroplasts' main role is to conduct photosynthesis, where the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll captures the energy from sunlight and converts it and stores it in the energy-storage molecules ATP and NADPH while freeing oxygen from water. They then use the ATP and NADPH to make organic molecules from carbon dioxide in a process known as the Calvin cycle. Chloroplasts carry out a number of other functions, including fatty acid synthesis, much amino acid synthesis, and the immune response in plants. The number of chloroplasts per cell varies from 1 in algae up to 100 in plants like Arabidopsis and wheat.A chloroplast is one of three types of plastids, characterized by its high concentration of chlorophyll, the other two types, the leucoplast and the chromoplast, contain little chlorophyll and do not carry out photosynthesis.Chloroplasts are highly dynamic—they circulate and are moved around within plant cells, and occasionally pinch in two to reproduce. Their behavior is strongly influenced by environmental factors like light color and intensity. Chloroplasts, like mitochondria, contain their own DNA, which is thought to be inherited from their ancestor—a photosynthetic cyanobacterium that was engulfed by an early eukaryotic cell. Chloroplasts cannot be made by the plant cell and must be inherited by each daughter cell during cell division.With one exception (the amoeboid ''Paulinella chromatophora''), all chloroplasts can probably be traced back to a single endosymbiotic event, when a cyanobacterium was engulfed by the eukaryote. Despite this, chloroplasts can be found in an extremely wide set of organisms, some not even directly related to each other—a consequence of many secondary and even tertiary endosymbiotic events.The word ''chloroplast'' () is derived from the Greek words ''chloros'' (χλωρός), which means green, and ''plastes'' (πλάστης), which means "the one who forms".3Chloroplast lineages and evolutionChloroplasts are one of many types of organelles in the plant cell. They are considered to have originated from cyanobacteria through endosymbiosis—when a eukaryotic cell engulfed a photosynthesizing cyanobacterium that became a permanent resident in the cell. Mitochondria are thought to have come from a similar event, where an aerobic prokaryote was engulfed.Biology-Campbell;ReeceThis origin of chloroplasts was first suggested by the Russian biologist Konstantin Mereschkowski in 1905 after Andreas Schimper observed in 1883 that chloroplasts closely resemble cyanobacteria. Chloroplasts are only found in plants and algae."Molecular biology of the cell—chloroplasts and photosynthesis";Cyanobacterial ancestorCyanobacteriaCyanobacteria are considered the ancestors of chloroplasts. They are sometimes called blue-green algae even though they are prokaryotes. They are a diverse phylum of bacteria capable of carrying out photosynthesis, and are gram-negative, meaning that they have two cell membranes. Cyanobacteria also contain a peptidoglycan cell wall, which is thicker than in other gram-negative bacteria, and which is located between their two cell membranes. Like chloroplasts, they have thylakoids within.Biology8th-Campbell;Reece-186-187On the thylakoid membranes are photosynthetic pigments, including chlorophyll ''a''."Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes"Phycobilins are also common cyanobacterial pigments, usually organized into hemispherical phycobilisomes attached to the outside of the thylakoid membranes (phycobilins are not shared with all chloroplasts though)."Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes"Primary endosymbiosisPrimary endosymbiosis'''Primary endosymbiosis'''A eukaryote with mitochondria engulfed a cyanobacterium in an event of serial primary endosymbiosis, creating a Archæplastida|lineage of cells with both organelles.Biology-Campbell;ReeceIt is important to note that the cyanobacterial endosymbiont already had a double membrane—the phagosomal vacuole-derived membrane was lost.AJB-historyofplastids;/div;;/div;;div style="float: right; clear: right; width: 480px; height: 30px; ";div style="float: right; clear: right; width: 550px; height: 200px; ";div style="float: right; clear: right; width: 500px; height: 50px; "Somewhere around a billion years ago,CurrentBiology-Endosymbiosisa free-living cyanobacterium entered an early eukaryotic cell, either as food or as an internal parasite,Biology-Campbell;Reecebut managed to escape the phagocytic vacuole it was contained in."Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes"The two innermost lipid-bilayer membranes"Plant Physiology—Chloroplast membrane proton permeability"; that surround all chloroplasts correspond to the outer and inner membranes of the ancestral cyanobacterium's gram negative cell wall, and not the phagosomal membrane from the host, which was probably lost.AJB-historyofplastidsThe new cellular resident quickly became an advantage, providing food for the eukaryotic host, which allowed it to live within it.Biology-Campbell;ReeceOver time, the cyanobacterium was assimilated, and many of its genes were lost or transferred to the nucleus of the host.BMCBiology-EvolvinganOrganelleSome of its proteins were then synthesized in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and imported back into the chloroplast (formerly the cyanobacterium).BMCBiology-EvolvinganOrganellePlantPhysiology-ChloroplastOriginThis event is called ''endosymbiosis'', or "cell living inside another cell". The cell living inside the other cell is called the ''endosymbiont''; the endosymbiont is found inside the ''host cell''.Biology-Campbell;ReeceChloroplasts are believed to have arisen after mitochondria, since all eukaryotes contain mitochondria, but not all have chloroplasts.Biology-Campbell;Reece; This is called ''serial endosymbiosis''—an early eukaryote engulfing the mitochondrion ancestor, and some descendants of it then engulfing the chloroplast ancestor, creating a cell with both chloroplasts and mitochondria.Biology-Campbell;ReeceWhether or not chloroplasts came from a single endosymbiotic event, or many independent engulfments across various eukaryotic lineages, has been long debated, but it is now generally held that all organisms with chloroplasts either share a single ancestor or obtained their chloroplast from organisms that share a common ancestor that took in a cyanobacterium 600–1600 million years ago.These chloroplasts, which can be traced back directly to a cyanobacterial ancestor, are known as ''primary plastids''"Wise—Plastid diversity"(''"plastid"'' in this context means almost the same thing as chloroplastBiology-Campbell;Reece).

[''Deoxyribonucleic acid''. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment.] eds. S.Draggan and C.Cleveland. Washington DC often abbreviated as '''ctDNA''', or '''cpDNA'''. It is also known as the plastome. Its existence was first proved in 1962, and first sequenced in 1986—when two Japanese research teams sequenced the chloroplast DNA of liverwort and tobacco. Since then, hundreds of chloroplast DNAs from various species have been sequenced, but they're mostly those of land plants and green algae—glaucophytes, red algae, and other algal groups are extremely underrepresented, potentially introducing some bias in views of "typical" chloroplast DNA structure and content.Molecular structureWith few exceptions, most chloroplasts have their entire chloroplast genome combined into a single large circular DNA molecule,Springer-TheChloroplast-18typically 120,000–170,000 base pairs long.BioscienceExplainedPNAS-RatesofctDNAevolutionAmericanJournalofBotanyThey can have a contour length of around 30–60 micrometers, and have a mass of about 80–130 million daltons.While usually thought of as a circular molecule, there is some evidence that chloroplast DNA molecules more often take on a linear shape.Springer-TheChloroplast-18"The Plant Cell—Linear chloroplast DNA";Inverted repeatsMany chloroplast DNAs contain two ''inverted repeats'', which separate a long single copy section (LSC) from a short single copy section (SSC).While a given pair of inverted repeats are rarely completely identical, they are always very similar to each other, apparently resulting from concerted evolution.Springer-TheChloroplast-18The inverted repeats vary wildly in length, ranging from 4,000 to 25,000 base pairs long each and containing as few as four or as many as over 150 genes.Springer-TheChloroplast-18Inverted repeats in plants tend to be at the upper end of this range, each being 20,000–25,000 base pairs long.AmericanJournalofBotanyThe inverted repeat regions are highly conserved among land plants, and accumulate few mutations.AmericanJournalofBotanyPNAS-InvertedRepeatsSimilar inverted repeats exist in the genomes of cyanobacteria and the other two chloroplast lineages (glaucophyta and rhodophyceæ), suggesting that they predate the chloroplast,Springer-TheChloroplast-18though some chloroplast DNAs have since lostPNAS-InvertedRepeatsCell-ctDNArearrangementor flipped the inverted repeats (making them direct repeats).Springer-TheChloroplast-18It is possible that the inverted repeats help stabilize the rest of the chloroplast genome, as chloroplast DNAs which have lost some of the inverted repeat segments tend to get rearranged more.NucleoidsNew chloroplasts may contain up to 100 copies of their DNA,BioscienceExplainedthough the number of chloroplast DNA copies decreases to about 15–20 as the chloroplasts age. They are usually packed into nucleoids, which can contain several identical chloroplast DNA rings. Many nucleoids can be found in each chloroplast.IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-ctDNA-62In primitive red algae, the chloroplast DNA nucleoids are clustered in the center of the chloroplast, while in green plants and green algae, the nucleoids are dispersed throughout the stroma."TPC-ChloroplastNucleoids"Though chloroplast DNA is not associated with true histones,Biology-Campbell;Reecein red algae, similar proteins that tightly pack each chloroplast DNA ring into a nucleoid have been found.DNA replicationThe Leading Model of cpDNA ReplicationFile:CpDNA Replication.png|thumb|upright=2.0|Chloroplast DNA replication via multiple D loop mechanisms. Adapted from Krishnan NM, Rao BJ's paper "A comparative approach to elucidate chloroplast genome replication."The mechanism for chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) replication has not been conclusively determined, but two main models have been proposed. Scientists have attempted to observe chloroplast replication via electron microscopy since the 1970s. The results of the microscopy experiments led to the idea that chloroplast DNA replicates using a double displacement loop (D-loop). As the D-loop moves through the circular DNA, it adopts a theta intermediary form, also known as a Cairns replication intermediate, and completes replication with a rolling circle mechanism."Krishnan""Bendich"Transcription starts at specific points of origin. Multiple replication forks open up, allowing replication machinery to transcribe the DNA. As replication continues, the forks grow and eventually converge. The new cpDNA structures separate, creating daughter cpDNA chromosomes.In addition to the early microscopy experiments, this model is also supported by the amounts of deamination seen in cpDNA."Krishnan"Deamination occurs when an amino group is lost and is a mutation that often results in base changes. When adenine is deaminated, it becomes hypoxanthine. Hypoxanthine can bind to cytosine, and when the XC base pair is replicated, it becomes a GC (thus, an A → G base change).File:Adenine Deaminates to Guanine.png|thumb|left|400px|Over time, base changes in the DNA sequence can arise from deamination mutations. When adenine is deaminated, it becomes hypoxanthine, which can pair with cytosine. During replication, the cytosine will pair with guanine, causing an A --; G base change.DeaminationIn cpDNA, there are several A → G deamination gradients. DNA becomes susceptible to deamination events when it is single stranded. When replication forks form, the strand not being copied is single stranded, and thus at risk for A → G deamination. Therefore, gradients in deamination indicate that replication forks were most likely present and the direction that they initially opened (the highest gradient is most likely nearest the start site because it was single stranded for the longest amount of time)."Krishnan"This mechanism is still the leading theory today; however, a second theory suggests that most cpDNA is actually linear and replicates through homologous recombination. It further contends that only a minority of the genetic material is kept in circular chromosomes while the rest is in branched, linear, or other complex structures."Krishnan""Bendich"Alternative Model of ReplicationOne of competing model for cpDNA replication asserts that most cpDNA is linear and participates in homologous recombination and replication structures similar to bacteriophage T4."Bendich"It has been established that some plants have linear cpDNA, such as maize, and that more species still contain complex structures that scientists do not yet understand. When the original experiments on cpDNA were performed, scientists did notice linear structures; however, they attributed these linear forms to broken circles."Bendich"If the branched and complex structures seen in cpDNA experiments are real and not artifacts of concatenated circular DNA or broken circles, then a D-loop mechanism of replication is insufficient to explain how those structures would replicate."Bendich"At the same time, homologous recombination does not expand the multiple A --; G gradients seen in plastomes."Krishnan"Because of the failure to explain the deamination gradient as well as the numerous plant species that have been shown to have circular cpDNA, the predominant theory continues to hold that most cpDNA is circular and most likely replicates via a D loop mechanism.Gene content and protein synthesisThe chloroplast genome most commonly includes around 100 genes that code for a variety of things, mostly to do with the protein pipeline and photosynthesis. As in prokaryotes, genes in chloroplast DNA are organized into operons.PlantPhysiology-ChloroplastOriginInterestingly though, unlike prokaryotic DNA molecules, chloroplast DNA molecules contain introns (plant mitochondrial DNAs do too, but not human mtDNAs)."Molecular biology of the cell—The Genetic Systems of Mitochondria and Plastids"Among land plants, the contents of the chloroplast genome are fairly similar.AmericanJournalofBotanyChloroplast genome reduction and gene transferOver time, many parts of the chloroplast genome were transferred to the nuclear genome of the host,BioscienceExplainedPNAS-RatesofctDNAevolutiona process called ''endosymbiotic gene transfer''. As a result, the chloroplast genome is heavily reduced compared to that of free-living cyanobacteria. Chloroplasts may contain 60–100 genes whereas cyanobacteria often have more than 1500 genes in their genome."PNAS—Cyanobacterial genes in Arabidopsis"; Recently, a plastid without a genome was found, demonstrating chloroplasts can lose their genome during endosymbiotic gene transfer process.Endosymbiotic gene transfer is how we know about the lost chloroplasts in many chromalveolate lineages. Even if a chloroplast is eventually lost, the genes it donated to the former host's nucleus persist, providing evidence for the lost chloroplast's existence. For example, while diatoms (a heterokontophyte) now have a red algal derived chloroplast, the presence of many green algal genes in the diatom nucleus provide evidence that the diatom ancestor (probably the ancestor of all chromalveolates too) had a green algal derived chloroplast at some point, which was subsequently replaced by the red chloroplast."Science—Prasinophytes in chromalveolates"In land plants, some 11–14% of the DNA in their nuclei can be traced back to the chloroplast,MolecularBiologyEvol-EndosymbioticGeneTransferup to 18% in ''Arabidopsis'', corresponding to about 4,500 protein-coding genes."Current Biology—Algal genomics"; There have been a few recent transfers of genes from the chloroplast DNA to the nuclear genome in land plants.PNAS-RatesofctDNAevolutionOf the approximately 3000 proteins found in chloroplasts, some 95% of them are encoded by nuclear genes. Many of the chloroplast's protein complexes consist of subunits from both the chloroplast genome and the host's nuclear genome. As a result, protein synthesis must be coordinated between the chloroplast and the nucleus. The chloroplast is mostly under nuclear control, though chloroplasts can also give out signals regulating gene expression in the nucleus, called ''retrograde signaling''.Protein synthesisProtein synthesis within chloroplasts relies on two RNA polymerases. One is coded by the chloroplast DNA, the other is of nuclear origin. The two RNA polymerases may recognize and bind to different kinds of promoters within the chloroplast genome. The ribosomes in chloroplasts are similar to bacterial ribosomes.Protein targeting and importBecause so many chloroplast genes have been moved to the nucleus, many proteins that would originally have been translated in the chloroplast are now synthesized in the cytoplasm of the plant cell. These proteins must be directed back to the chloroplast, and imported through at least two chloroplast membranes."Nature—Protein import";Curiously, around half of the protein products of transferred genes aren't even targeted back to the chloroplast. Many became exaptations, taking on new functions like participating in cell division, protein routing, and even disease resistance. A few chloroplast genes found new homes in the mitochondrial genome—most became nonfunctional pseudogenes, though a few tRNA genes still work in the mitochondrion."PNAS—Cyanobacterial genes in Arabidopsis"Some transferred chloroplast DNA protein products get directed to the secretory pathway"PNAS—Cyanobacterial genes in Arabidopsis"(though it should be noted that many secondary plastids are bounded by an outermost membrane derived from the host's cell membrane, and therefore topologically outside of the cell, because to reach the chloroplast from the cytosol, you have to cross the cell membrane, just like if you were headed for the extracellular space. In those cases, chloroplast-targeted proteins do initially travel along the secretory pathway)."RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids"Because the cell acquiring a chloroplast already had mitochondria (and peroxisomes, and a cell membrane for secretion), the new chloroplast host had to develop a unique protein targeting system to avoid having chloroplast proteins being sent to the wrong organelle, and the wrong proteins being sent to the chloroplast."Nature—Protein import"In most, but not all cases, nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins are translated with a ''cleavable transit peptide'' that's added to the N-terminus of the protein precursor. Sometimes the transit sequence is found on the C-terminus of the protein,"The Plant Cell—C-terminal transit sequences"; or within the functional part of the protein."Nature—Protein import"Transport proteins and membrane transloconsAfter a chloroplast polypeptide is synthesized on a ribosome in the cytosol, an enzyme specific to chloroplast proteins"JBC—Transit sequence phosphorylation"; phosphorylates, or adds a phosphate group to many (but not all) of them in their transit sequences."Nature—Protein import"Phosphorylation helps many proteins bind the polypeptide, keeping it from folding prematurely."Nature—Protein import"This is important because it prevents chloroplast proteins from assuming their active form and carrying out their chloroplast functions in the wrong place—the cytosol."The Plant Cell—14-3-3 proteins""BBA—Tic-toc"; At the same time, they have to keep just enough shape so that they can be recognized by the chloroplast."The Plant Cell—14-3-3 proteins"; These proteins also help the polypeptide get imported into the chloroplast."Nature—Protein import"From here, chloroplast proteins bound for the stroma must pass through two protein complexes—the TOC complex, or '''''t'''ranslocon on the '''o'''uter '''c'''hloroplast membrane'', and the TIC translocon, or '''''t'''ranslocon on the '''i'''nner '''c'''hloroplast membrane translocon''.;;"Nature—Protein import"Chloroplast polypeptide chains probably often travel through the two complexes at the same time, but the TIC complex can also retrieve preproteins lost in the intermembrane space."Nature—Protein import"StructureFile:Chloroplast in leaf of Anemone sp TEM 12000x.png|thumb|right|Transmission electron microscope image of a chloroplast. Grana of thylakoids and their connecting lamellae are clearly visible.In land plants, chloroplasts are generally lens-shaped, 5–8 μm in diameter and 1–3 μm thick. Greater diversity in chloroplast shapes exists among the algae, which often contain a single chloroplast"Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes"that can be shaped like a net (e.g., ''Oedogonium''), a cup (e.g., ''Chlamydomonas''), a ribbon-like spiral around the edges of the cell (e.g., ''Spirogyra''), or slightly twisted bands at the cell edges (e.g., ''Sirogonium''). Some algae have two chloroplasts in each cell; they are star-shaped in ''Zygnema'', or may follow the shape of half the cell in order Desmidiales. In some algae, the chloroplast takes up most of the cell, with pockets for the nucleus and other organelles"Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes"; (for example some species of ''Chlorella'' have a cup-shaped chloroplast that occupies much of the cell).All chloroplasts have at least three membrane systems—the outer chloroplast membrane, the inner chloroplast membrane, and the thylakoid system. Chloroplasts that are the product of secondary endosymbiosis may have additional membranes surrounding these three."Plant Molecular Biology"Inside the outer and inner chloroplast membranes is the chloroplast stroma, a semi-gel-like fluid"Wise—Plastid diversity"; that makes up much of a chloroplast's volume, and in which the thylakoid system floats.Chloroplast membraneThere are some common misconceptions about the outer and inner chloroplast membranes. The fact that chloroplasts are surrounded by a double membrane is often cited as evidence that they are the descendants of endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. This is often interpreted as meaning the outer chloroplast membrane is the product of the host's cell membrane infolding to form a vesicle to surround the ancestral cyanobacterium—which is not true—both chloroplast membranes are homologous to the cyanobacterium's original double membranes.AJB-historyofplastidsThe chloroplast double membrane is also often compared to the mitochondrial double membrane. This is not a valid comparison—the inner mitochondria membrane is used to run proton pumps and carry out oxidative phosphorylation across to generate ATP energy. The only chloroplast structure that can considered analogous to it is the internal thylakoid system. Even so, in terms of "in-out", the direction of chloroplast hydronium|H ion flow is in the opposite direction compared to oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria."Wise—Plastid diversity""Biology 8th—Campbell ; Reece—196–197"; In addition, in terms of function, the inner chloroplast membrane, which regulates metabolite passage and synthesizes some materials, has no counterpart in the mitochondrion."Wise—Plastid diversity"Outer chloroplast membraneChloroplast membraneThe outer chloroplast membrane is a semi-porous membrane that small molecules and ions can easily diffuse across. However, it is not permeable to larger proteins, so chloroplast polypeptides being synthesized in the cell cytoplasm must be transported across the outer chloroplast membrane by the TOC complex, or '''''t'''ranslocon on the '''o'''uter '''c'''hloroplast'' membrane."Nature—Protein import"The chloroplast membranes sometimes protrude out into the cytoplasm, forming a stromule, or '''strom'''a-containing tub'''ule'''. Stromules are very rare in chloroplasts, and are much more common in other plastids like chromoplasts and amyloplasts in petals and roots, respectively."Köhler2000"; They may exist to increase the chloroplast's surface area for cross-membrane transport, because they are often branched and tangled with the endoplasmic reticulum."Plant Physiology—Stromule branching"; When they were first observed in 1962, some plant biologists dismissed the structures as artifactual, claiming that stromules were just oddly shaped chloroplasts with constricted regions or dividing chloroplasts."The Plant Cell—No plastid networks"; However, there is a growing body of evidence that stromules are functional, integral features of plant cell plastids, not merely artifacts.Intermembrane space and peptidoglycan wallFile:Glaucocystis sp.jpg|thumb|Instead of an intermembrane space, glaucophyte algae have a peptidoglycan wall between their inner and outer chloroplast membranes.Usually, a thin intermembrane space about 10–20 nanometers thick exists between the outer and inner chloroplast membranes."Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46";Glaucophyte algal chloroplasts have a peptidoglycan layer between the chloroplast membranes. It corresponds to the peptidoglycan cell wall of their cyanobacterial ancestors, which is located between their two cell membranes. These chloroplasts are called muroplasts (from Latin ''"mura"'', meaning "wall"). Other chloroplasts have lost the cyanobacterial wall, leaving an intermembrane space between the two chloroplast envelope membranes."Wise—Plastid diversity"Inner chloroplast membraneChloroplast membraneThe inner chloroplast membrane borders the stroma and regulates passage of materials in and out of the chloroplast. After passing through the TOC complex in the outer chloroplast membrane, polypeptides must pass through the TIC complex ''('''t'''ranslocon on the '''i'''nner '''c'''hloroplast membrane)'' which is located in the inner chloroplast membrane."Nature—Protein import"In addition to regulating the passage of materials, the inner chloroplast membrane is where fatty acids, lipids, and carotenoids are synthesized."Wise—Plastid diversity"Peripheral reticulumSome chloroplasts contain a structure called the chloroplast peripheral reticulum."Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46"It is often found in the chloroplasts of C4 plant| plants, though it has also been found in some  angiosperms,"Wise—Plastid diversity"and even some gymnosperms. The chloroplast peripheral reticulum consists of a maze of membranous tubes and vesicles continuous with the inner chloroplast membrane that extends into the internal stromal fluid of the chloroplast. Its purpose is thought to be to increase the chloroplast's surface area for cross-membrane transport between its stroma and the cell cytoplasm. The small vesicles sometimes observed may serve as transport vesicles to shuttle stuff between the thylakoids and intermembrane space.StructureandFunctionofPlastidsStromaThe protein-rich,"Wise—Plastid diversity"alkaline,"Biology 8th—Campbell ; Reece—196–197"aqueous fluid within the inner chloroplast membrane and outside of the thylakoid space is called the stroma,"Wise—Plastid diversity"which corresponds to the cytosol of the original cyanobacterium.

The Calvin cycle, which fixes CO2|CO2 into sugar takes place in the stroma.Chloroplast ribosomes#cec51bChloroplasts have their own ribosomes, which they use to synthesize a small fraction of their proteins.

They are not found in higher plants. Pyrenoids are roughly spherical and highly refractive bodies which are a site of starch accumulation in plants that contain them. They consist of a matrix opaque to electrons, surrounded by two hemispherical starch plates. The starch is accumulated as the pyrenoids mature.DevelopmentandStructureofPyrenoidsIn algae with carbon concentrating mechanisms, the enzyme rubisco is found in the pyrenoids.

The helices ascend at an angle of 20–25°, connecting to each granal thylakoid at a bridge-like slit junction. The helicoids may extend as large sheets that link multiple grana, or narrow to tube-like bridges between grana."Plant Physiology—Granal structure"While different parts of the thylakoid system contain different membrane proteins, the thylakoid membranes are continuous and the thylakoid space they enclose form a single continuous labyrinth."The Plant Cell—Thylakoid system"ThylakoidsThylakoids (sometimes spelled ''thylakoïds''), are small interconnected sacks which contain the membranes that the light reactions of photosynthesis take place on. The word ''thylakoid'' comes from the Greek word ''thylakos'' which means "sack".Embedded in the thylakoid membranes are important protein complexes which carry out the light reactions of photosynthesis. Photosystem II and photosystem I contain light-harvesting complexes with chlorophyll and carotenoids that absorb light energy and use it to energize electrons. Molecules in the thylakoid membrane use the energized electrons to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, decreasing the pH and turning it acidic. ATP synthase is a large protein complex that harnesses the concentration gradient of the hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space to generate ATP energy as the hydrogen ions flow back out into the stroma—much like a dam turbine."Biology 8th—Campbell ; Reece—196–197"There are two types of thylakoids—granal thylakoids, which are arranged in grana, and stromal thylakoids, which are in contact with the stroma. Granal thylakoids are pancake-shaped circular disks about 300–600 nanometers in diameter. Stromal thylakoids are helicoid sheets that spiral around grana."The Plant Cell—Thylakoid system"The flat tops and bottoms of granal thylakoids contain only the relatively flat photosystem II protein complex. This allows them to stack tightly, forming grana with many layers of tightly appressed membrane, called granal membrane, increasing stability and surface area for light capture."The Plant Cell—Thylakoid system"In contrast, photosystem I and ATP synthase are large protein complexes which jut out into the stroma. They can't fit in the appressed granal membranes, and so are found in the stromal thylakoid membrane—the edges of the granal thylakoid disks and the stromal thylakoids. These large protein complexes may act as spacers between the sheets of stromal thylakoids."The Plant Cell—Thylakoid system"The number of thylakoids and the total thylakoid area of a chloroplast is influenced by light exposure. Shaded chloroplasts contain larger and more grana with more thylakoid membrane area than chloroplasts exposed to bright light, which have smaller and fewer grana and less thylakoid area. Thylakoid extent can change within minutes of light exposure or removal.StructureandFunctionofPlastidsPigments and chloroplast colorsInside the photosystems embedded in chloroplast thylakoid membranes are various photosynthetic pigments, which absorb and transfer light energy.

Rubisco has a problem—it has trouble distinguishing between carbon dioxide and oxygen, so at high oxygen concentrations, rubisco starts accidentally adding oxygen to sugar precursors. This has the end result of ATP energy being wasted and  being released, all with no sugar being produced. This is a big problem, since O2 is produced by the initial light reactions of photosynthesis, causing issues down the line in the Calvin cycle which uses rubisco.Biology-Campbell;Reece-200-201;C4 plants| plants evolved a way to solve this—by spatially separating the light reactions and the Calvin cycle. The light reactions, which store light energy in ATP and NADPH, are done in the mesophyll cells of a  leaf. The Calvin cycle, which uses the stored energy to make sugar using rubisco, is done in the bundle sheath cells, a layer of cells surrounding a vein in a leaf.Biology-Campbell;Reece-200-201As a result, chloroplasts in  mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells are specialized for each stage of photosynthesis. In mesophyll cells, chloroplasts are specialized for the light reactions, so they lack rubisco, and have normal grana and thylakoids, which they use to make ATP and NADPH, as well as oxygen. They store  in a four-carbon compound, which is why the process is called C4 carbon fixation|'' photosynthesis''. The four-carbon compound is then transported to the bundle sheath chloroplasts, where it drops off  and returns to the mesophyll. Bundle sheath chloroplasts do not carry out the light reactions, preventing oxygen from building up in them and disrupting rubisco activity.Biology-Campbell;Reece-200-201Because of this, they lack thylakoids organized into grana stacks—though bundle sheath chloroplasts still have free-floating thylakoids in the stroma where they still carry out cyclic electron flow, a light-driven method of synthesizing ATP to power the Calvin cycle without generating oxygen. They lack photosystem II, and only have photosystem I—the only protein complex needed for cyclic electron flow.PlantCellBiology-C4Biology-Campbell;Reece-200-201Because the job of bundle sheath chloroplasts is to carry out the Calvin cycle and make sugar, they often contain large starch grains.PlantCellBiology-C4Both types of chloroplast contain large amounts of chloroplast peripheral reticulum,PlantCellBiology-C4which they use to get more surface area to transport stuff in and out of them."NewPhytologist-GymnospermPeripheralReticulum"Mesophyll chloroplasts have a little more peripheral reticulum than bundle sheath chloroplasts.LocationDistribution in a plantNot all cells in a multicellular plant contain chloroplasts. All green parts of a plant contain chloroplasts—the chloroplasts, or more specifically, the chlorophyll in them are what make the photosynthetic parts of a plant green.Biology8th-Campbell;Reece-186-187; The plant cells which contain chloroplasts are usually parenchyma cells, though chloroplasts can also be found in collenchyma tissue. A plant cell which contains chloroplasts is known as a chlorenchyma cell. A typical chlorenchyma cell of a land plant contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts.#5ca255In some plants such as cacti, chloroplasts are found in the stems, though in most plants, chloroplasts are concentrated in the leaves. One square millimeter of leaf tissue can contain half a million chloroplasts.Biology8th-Campbell;Reece-186-187Within a leaf, chloroplasts are mainly found in the mesophyll layers of a leaf, and the guard cells of stomata. Palisade mesophyll cells can contain 30–70 chloroplasts per cell, while stomatal guard cells contain only around 8–15 per cell, as well as much less chlorophyll. Chloroplasts can also be found in the bundle sheath cells of a leaf, especially in C4 plants|C4 plants, which carry out the Calvin cycle in their bundle sheath cells. They are often absent from the epidermis of a leaf."Plant Physiology Online—Guard Cell Photosynthesis";Cellular locationChloroplast movement#3fbcebCytoplasmic streamingThe chloroplasts of plant and algal cells can orient themselves to best suit the available light. In low-light conditions, they will spread out in a sheet—maximizing the surface area to absorb light. Under intense light, they will seek shelter by aligning in vertical columns along the plant cell's cell wall or turning sideways so that light strikes them edge-on. This reduces exposure and protects them from photooxidative damage. This ability to distribute chloroplasts so that they can take shelter behind each other or spread out may be the reason why land plants evolved to have many small chloroplasts instead of a few big ones.Traffic-ChloroplastDivisionChloroplast movement is considered one of the most closely regulated stimulus-response systems that can be found in plants. Mitochondria have also been observed to follow chloroplasts as they move.In higher plants, chloroplast movement is run by phototropins, blue light photoreceptors also responsible for plant phototropism. In some algae, mosses, ferns, and flowering plants, chloroplast movement is influenced by red light in addition to blue light,ThePlantCell-ChloroplastMovementthough very long red wavelengths inhibit movement rather than speeding it up. Blue light generally causes chloroplasts to seek shelter, while red light draws them out to maximize light absorption.JEB-ActinBasedChloroplastMovementStudies of ''Vallisneria gigantea'', an aquatic flowering plant, have shown that chloroplasts can get moving within five minutes of light exposure, though they don't initially show any net directionality. They may move along microfilament tracks, and the fact that the microfilament mesh changes shape to form a honeycomb structure surrounding the chloroplasts after they have moved suggests that microfilaments may help to anchor chloroplasts in place.PlantCellPhysiology-MicrofilamentAnchorsJEB-ActinBasedChloroplastMovementFunction and chemistryGuard cell chloroplastsUnlike most epidermal cells, the guard cells of plant stomata contain relatively well developed chloroplasts."Plant Physiology Online—Guard Cell Photosynthesis"However, exactly what they do is controversial.Plant innate immunityPlants lack specialized immune cells—all plant cells participate in the plant immune response. Chloroplasts, along with the nucleus, cell membrane, and endoplasmic reticulum, are key players in pathogen defense. Due to its role in a plant cell's immune response, pathogens frequently target the chloroplast.MPMI-AllHandsonDeckPlants have two main immune responses—the hypersensitive response, in which infected cells seal themselves off and undergo programmed cell death, and systemic acquired resistance, where infected cells release signals warning the rest of the plant of a pathogen's presence.Chloroplasts stimulate both responses by purposely damaging their photosynthetic system, producing reactive oxygen species. High levels of reactive oxygen species will cause the hypersensitive response. The reactive oxygen species also directly kill any pathogens within the cell. Lower levels of reactive oxygen species initiate systemic acquired resistance, triggering defense-molecule production in the rest of the plant.MPMI-AllHandsonDeckIn some plants, chloroplasts are known to move closer to the infection site and the nucleus during an infection.MPMI-AllHandsonDeckChloroplasts can serve as cellular sensors. After detecting stress in a cell, which might be due to a pathogen, chloroplasts begin producing molecules like salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species which can serve as defense-signals. As cellular signals, reactive oxygen species are unstable molecules, so they probably don't leave the chloroplast, but instead pass on their signal to an unknown second messenger molecule. All these molecules initiate retrograde signaling—signals from the chloroplast that regulate gene expression in the nucleus.MPMI-AllHandsonDeckIn addition to defense signaling, chloroplasts, with the help of the peroxisomes, help synthesize an important defense molecule, jasmonate. Chloroplasts synthesize all the fatty acids in a plant cellMPMI-AllHandsonDeck—linoleic acid, a fatty acid, is a precursor to jasmonate.MPMI-AllHandsonDeckPhotosynthesisPhotosynthesisOne of the main functions of the chloroplast is its role in photosynthesis, the process by which light is transformed into chemical energy, to subsequently produce food in the form of sugars. Water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are used in photosynthesis, and sugar and oxygen (O2) is made, using light energy. Photosynthesis is divided into two stages—the light reactions, where water is split to produce oxygen, and the dark reactions, or Calvin cycle, which builds sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. The two phases are linked by the energy carriers adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+).CampbellBiology-PhotosynthesisLight reactionsLight reactionsThe light reactions take place on the thylakoid membranes. They take light energy and store it in NADPH, a form of NADP+, and ATP to fuel the dark reactions.= Energy carriers =NADPHATP is the phosphorylated version of adenosine diphosphate (ADP), which stores energy in a cell and powers most cellular activities. ATP is the energized form, while ADP is the (partially) depleted form. NADP+ is an electron carrier which ferries high energy electrons. In the light reactions, it gets reduced, meaning it picks up electrons, becoming NADPH.= Photophosphorylation =PhotophosphorylationLike mitochondria, chloroplasts use the potential energy stored in an Hydron (chemistry)|H+, or hydrogen ion gradient to generate ATP energy. The two photosystems capture light energy to energize electrons taken from water, and release them down an electron transport chain. The molecules between the photosystems harness the electrons' energy to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, creating a concentration gradient, with more hydrogen ions (up to a thousand times as many)"Biology 8th—Campbell ; Reece—196–197"inside the thylakoid system than in the stroma. The hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space then diffuse back down their concentration gradient, flowing back out into the stroma through ATP synthase. ATP synthase uses the energy from the flowing hydrogen ions to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate into adenosine triphosphate, or ATP."Biology 8th—Campbell ; Reece—196–197"Because chloroplast ATP synthase projects out into the stroma, the ATP is synthesized there, in position to be used in the dark reactions."Biochemistry—Proton gradient";= NADP+ reduction =Redox reactionElectrons are often removed from the electron transport chains to charge NADP+|NADP+ with electrons, reducing it to NADPH. Like ATP synthase, ferredoxin—NADP+ reductase|ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase, the enzyme that reduces NADP+, releases the NADPH it makes into the stroma, right where it is needed for the dark reactions."Biochemistry—Proton gradient"Because NADP+ reduction removes electrons from the electron transport chains, they must be replaced—the job of photosystem II, which splits water molecules (H2O) to obtain the electrons from its hydrogen atoms."Biology 8th—Campbell ; Reece—196–197"= Cyclic photophosphorylation =Cyclic photophosphorylationWhile photosystem II photolyzes water to obtain and energize new electrons, photosystem I simply reenergizes depleted electrons at the end of an electron transport chain. Normally, the reenergized electrons are taken by NADP+, though sometimes they can flow back down more H+-pumping electron transport chains to transport more hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space to generate more ATP. This is termed cyclic photophosphorylation because the electrons are recycled. Cyclic photophosphorylation is common in C4 plants| plants, which need more ATP than NADPH.Biology-Campbell;Reece-200-201Dark reactionsDark reactionsThe Calvin cycle, also known as the dark reactions, is a series of biochemical reactions that fixes CO2|CO2 into G3P sugar molecules and uses the energy and electrons from the ATP and NADPH made in the light reactions. The Calvin cycle takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast.Biology-Campbell;Reece-200-201While named ''"the dark reactions"'', in most plants, they take place in the light, since the dark reactions are dependent on the products of the light reactions.Biology8th-Campbell;Reece-186-187= Carbon fixation and G3P synthesis =The Calvin cycle starts by using the enzyme Rubisco to fix CO2 into five-carbon Ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) molecules. The result is unstable six-carbon molecules that immediately break down into three-carbon molecules called 3-phosphoglyceric acid, or 3-PGA.The ATP and NADPH made in the light reactions is used to convert the 3-PGA into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, or G3P sugar molecules. Most of the G3P molecules are recycled back into RuBP using energy from more ATP, but one out of every six produced leaves the cycle—the end product of the dark reactions.Biology-Campbell;Reece-200-201= Sugars and starches =Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate can double up to form larger sugar molecules like glucose and fructose. These molecules are processed, and from them, the still larger sucrose, a disaccharide commonly known as table sugar, is made, though this process takes place outside of the chloroplast, in the cytoplasm."Biochemistry—Calvin cycle";Alternatively, glucose monomers in the chloroplast can be linked together to make starch, which accumulates into the starch grains found in the chloroplast."Biochemistry—Calvin cycle"Under conditions such as high atmospheric CO2 concentrations, these starch grains may grow very large, distorting the grana and thylakoids. The starch granules displace the thylakoids, but leave them intact.PlantPhysiology-FloodingandStarchAccumulationWaterlogged roots can also cause starch buildup in the chloroplasts, possibly due to less sucrose being exported out of the chloroplast (or more accurately, the plant cell). This depletes a plant's free phosphate supply, which indirectly stimulates chloroplast starch synthesis.While linked to low photosynthesis rates, the starch grains themselves may not necessarily interfere significantly with the efficiency of photosynthesis, and might simply be a side effect of another photosynthesis-depressing factor.PlantPhysiology-FloodingandStarchAccumulation= Photorespiration =Photorespiration can occur when the oxygen concentration is too high. Rubisco cannot distinguish between oxygen and carbon dioxide very well, so it can accidentally add O2 instead of CO2 to RuBP. This process reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis—it consumes ATP and oxygen, releases CO2, and produces no sugar. It can waste up to half the carbon fixed by the Calvin cycle.CampbellBiology-PhotosynthesisSeveral mechanisms have evolved in different lineages that raise the carbon dioxide concentration relative to oxygen within the chloroplast, increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis. These mechanisms are called carbon dioxide concentrating mechanisms, or CCMs. These include Crassulacean acid metabolism, C4 carbon fixation| carbon fixation,CampbellBiology-Photosynthesisand pyrenoids. Chloroplasts in  plants are notable as they exhibit a distinct chloroplast dimorphism.pHBecause of the Hydron (chemistry)|H+ gradient across the thylakoid membrane, the interior of the thylakoid is acidic, with a pH around 4, while the stroma is slightly basic, with a pH of around 8.The optimal stroma pH for the Calvin cycle is 8.1, with the reaction nearly stopping when the pH falls below 7.3."Werdan 1975"CO2|CO2 in water can form carbonic acid, which can disturb the pH of isolated chloroplasts, interfering with photosynthesis, even though CO2 is used in photosynthesis. However, chloroplasts in living plant cells are not affected by this as much.PlantPhysiology-ChloroplastpHChloroplasts can pump Potassium|K+ and H+ ions in and out of themselves using a poorly understood light-driven transport system.PlantPhysiology-ChloroplastpHIn the presence of light, the pH of the thylakoid lumen can drop up to 1.5 pH units, while the pH of the stroma can rise by nearly one pH unit.Amino acid synthesisChloroplasts alone make almost all of a plant cell's amino acids in their stromaIntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-56except the sulfur-containing ones like cysteine and methionine."PNAS—Chloroplast envelope integral proteins and transporters";"Plant Physiology—Cysteine synthesis"Cysteine is made in the chloroplast (the proplastid too) but it is also synthesized in the cytosol and mitochondria, probably because it has trouble crossing membranes to get to where it is needed."Plant Physiology—Cysteine synthesis"; The chloroplast is known to make the precursors to methionine but it is unclear whether the organelle carries out the last leg of the pathway or if it happens in the cytosol."PNAS—Methionine synthesis";Other nitrogen compoundsChloroplasts make all of a cell's purines and pyrimidines—the nitrogenous bases found in DNA and RNA.IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-56They also convert nitrite (NO2−) into ammonia (NH3) which supplies the plant with nitrogen to make its amino acids and nucleotides.IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-56Other chemical productsChloroplasts are the site of complex lipid metabolism.Differentiation, replication, and inheritancePlastidChloroplasts are a special type of a plant cell organelle called a '''plastid''', though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. There are many other types of plastids, which carry out various functions. All chloroplasts in a plant are descended from undifferentiated proplastids found in the zygote, or fertilized egg. Proplastids are commonly found in an adult plant's apical meristems. Chloroplasts do not normally develop from proplastids in root tip meristems—instead, the formation of starch-storing amyloplasts is more common.IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-56In shoots, proplastids from shoot apical meristems can gradually develop into chloroplasts in photosynthetic leaf tissues as the leaf matures, if exposed to the required light."Molecular biology of the cell—chloroplasts and photosynthesis"This process involves invaginations of the inner plastid membrane, forming sheets of membrane that project into the internal stroma. These membrane sheets then fold to form thylakoids and grana.If angiosperm shoots are not exposed to the required light for chloroplast formation, proplastids may develop into an etioplast stage before becoming chloroplasts. An etioplast is a plastid that lacks chlorophyll, and has inner membrane invaginations that form a lattice of tubes in their stroma, called a prolamellar body. While etioplasts lack chlorophyll, they have a yellow chlorophyll precursor stocked."Molecular biology of the cell—chloroplasts and photosynthesis"Within a few minutes of light exposure, the prolamellar body begins to reorganize into stacks of thylakoids, and chlorophyll starts to be produced. This process, where the etioplast becomes a chloroplast, takes several hours.IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-54Gymnosperms do not require light to form chloroplasts.IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-54Light, however, does not guarantee that a proplastid will develop into a chloroplast. Whether a proplastid develops into a chloroplast some other kind of plastid is mostly controlled by the nucleus"Molecular biology of the cell—chloroplasts and photosynthesis"and is largely influenced by the kind of cell it resides in.IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-56#bbbPlastid interconversionPlastid differentiation is not permanent, in fact many interconversions are possible. Chloroplasts may be converted to chromoplasts, which are pigment-filled plastids responsible for the bright colors seen in flowers and ripe fruit. Starch storing amyloplasts can also be converted to chromoplasts, and it is possible for proplastids to develop straight into chromoplasts. Chromoplasts and amyloplasts can also become chloroplasts, like what happens when a carrot or a potato is illuminated. If a plant is injured, or something else causes a plant cell to revert to a meristematic state, chloroplasts and other plastids can turn back into proplastids. Chloroplast, amyloplast, chromoplast, proplast, etc., are not absolute states—intermediate forms are common.IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-56Chloroplast divisionMost chloroplasts in a photosynthetic cell do not develop directly from proplastids or etioplasts. In fact, a typical shoot meristematic plant cell contains only 7–20 proplastids. These proplastids differentiate into chloroplasts, which divide to create the 30–70 chloroplasts found in a mature photosynthetic plant cell. If the cell divides, chloroplast division provides the additional chloroplasts to partition between the two daughter cells.In single-celled algae, chloroplast division is the only way new chloroplasts are formed. There is no proplastid differentiation—when an algal cell divides, its chloroplast divides along with it, and each daughter cell receives a mature chloroplast.IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-54Almost all chloroplasts in a cell divide, rather than a small group of rapidly dividing chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have no definite S-phase—their DNA replication is not synchronized or limited to that of their host cells.Much of what we know about chloroplast division comes from studying organisms like ''Arabidopsis'' and the red alga ''Cyanidioschyzon merolæ''.Traffic-ChloroplastDivisionThe division process starts when the proteins FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 assemble into filaments, and with the help of a protein ARC6, form a structure called a Z-ring within the chloroplast's stroma. The Min system manages the placement of the Z-ring, ensuring that the chloroplast is cleaved more or less evenly. The protein MinD prevents FtsZ from linking up and forming filaments. Another protein ARC3 may also be involved, but it is not very well understood. These proteins are active at the poles of the chloroplast, preventing Z-ring formation there, but near the center of the chloroplast, MinE inhibits them, allowing the Z-ring to form.Traffic-ChloroplastDivisionNext, the two plastid-dividing rings, or PD rings form. The inner plastid-dividing ring is located in the inner side of the chloroplast's inner membrane, and is formed first.Traffic-ChloroplastDivisionThe outer plastid-dividing ring is found wrapped around the outer chloroplast membrane. It consists of filaments about 5 nanometers across,Traffic-ChloroplastDivisionarranged in rows 6.4 nanometers apart, and shrinks to squeeze the chloroplast. This is when chloroplast constriction begins.ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivisionIn a few species like ''Cyanidioschyzon merolæ'', chloroplasts have a third plastid-dividing ring located in the chloroplast's intermembrane space.Traffic-ChloroplastDivisionThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivisionLate into the constriction phase, dynamin proteins assemble around the outer plastid-dividing ring,ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivisionhelping provide force to squeeze the chloroplast.Traffic-ChloroplastDivisionMeanwhile, the Z-ring and the inner plastid-dividing ring break down.ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivisionDuring this stage, the many chloroplast DNA plasmids floating around in the stroma are partitioned and distributed to the two forming daughter chloroplasts.Later, the dynamins migrate under the outer plastid dividing ring, into direct contact with the chloroplast's outer membrane,ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivisionto cleave the chloroplast in two daughter chloroplasts.Traffic-ChloroplastDivisionA remnant of the outer plastid dividing ring remains floating between the two daughter chloroplasts, and a remnant of the dynamin ring remains attached to one of the daughter chloroplasts.ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivisionOf the five or six rings involved in chloroplast division, only the outer plastid-dividing ring is present for the entire constriction and division phase—while the Z-ring forms first, constriction does not begin until the outer plastid-dividing ring forms.ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivision}}RegulationIn species of algae that contain a single chloroplast, regulation of chloroplast division is extremely important to ensure that each daughter cell receives a chloroplast—chloroplasts can't be made from scratch."Molecular biology of the cell—The Genetic Systems of Mitochondria and Plastids";Traffic-ChloroplastDivisionIn organisms like plants, whose cells contain multiple chloroplasts, coordination is looser and less important. It is likely that chloroplast and cell division are somewhat synchronized, though the mechanisms for it are mostly unknown.Traffic-ChloroplastDivisionLight has been shown to be a requirement for chloroplast division. Chloroplasts can grow and progress through some of the constriction stages under poor quality green light, but are slow to complete division—they require exposure to bright white light to complete division. Spinach leaves grown under green light have been observed to contain many large dumbbell-shaped chloroplasts. Exposure to white light can stimulate these chloroplasts to divide and reduce the population of dumbbell-shaped chloroplasts."RSPBChloroplastDivision"PlantPhysiology-EffectofLightonChloroplastDivisionChloroplast inheritanceLike mitochondria, chloroplasts are usually inherited from a single parent. Biparental chloroplast inheritance—where plastid genes are inherited from both parent plants—occurs in very low levels in some flowering plants.AJB-ChloroplastInheritanceMany mechanisms prevent biparental chloroplast DNA inheritance, including selective destruction of chloroplasts or their genes within the gamete or zygote, and chloroplasts from one parent being excluded from the embryo. Parental chloroplasts can be sorted so that only one type is present in each offspring.Gymnosperms, such as pine trees, mostly pass on chloroplasts paternally, while flowering plants often inherit chloroplasts maternally.ruf2007Flowering plants were once thought to only inherit chloroplasts maternally. However, there are now many documented cases of angiosperms inheriting chloroplasts paternally.Angiosperms, which pass on chloroplasts maternally, have many ways to prevent paternal inheritance. Most of them produce sperm cells that do not contain any plastids. There are many other documented mechanisms that prevent paternal inheritance in these flowering plants, such as different rates of chloroplast replication within the embryo.AJB-ChloroplastInheritanceAmong angiosperms, paternal chloroplast inheritance is observed more often in hybrids than in offspring from parents of the same species. This suggests that incompatible hybrid genes might interfere with the mechanisms that prevent paternal inheritance.AJB-ChloroplastInheritanceTransplastomic plantsRecently, chloroplasts have caught attention by developers of genetically modified crops. Since, in most flowering plants, chloroplasts are not inherited from the male parent, transgenes in these plastids cannot be disseminated by pollen. This makes plastid transformation a valuable tool for the creation and cultivation of genetically modified plants that are biologically contained, thus posing significantly lower environmental risks. This biological containment strategy is therefore suitable for establishing the coexistence of conventional and organic agriculture. While the reliability of this mechanism has not yet been studied for all relevant crop species, recent results in tobacco plants are promising, showing a failed containment rate of transplastomic plants at 3 in 1,000,000.References==;;30emExternal linksChloroplasts*
