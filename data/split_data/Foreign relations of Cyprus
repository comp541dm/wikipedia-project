'''Cyprus''' is a member of the United Nations'S/4469';  along with most of its agencies as well as the Commonwealth of Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Council of Europe. In addition, the country has signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the ''Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Agreement'' (MIGA). Cyprus has been a member of the European Union since 2004 and in the second half of the 2012 it held the presidency of the Council of the European Union.Non-alignmentCyprus has historically followed a non-aligned foreign policy, although it increasingly identifies with the West in its cultural affinities and trade patterns, and maintains close relations with European Union, Greece and Israel.File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F013050-0001, München, Staatsbesuch Präsident von Zypern.jpg|thumb|left|Cyprus former President Makarios III at a state visit in Munich with the German Chancellor in 1962File:EU Foreign Ministers Gymnich Meeting in Cyprus. 7.-8. September 2012 (7954502290).jpg|thumb|left|Foreign Ministers of the European Union countries in Limassol during Cyprus Presidency of the EU in 2012The prime originator of Cypriot non-alignment was Makarios III, the first President (1960–1977) of the independent republic of Cyprus. Prior to independence, Makarios - by virtue of his post as Archbishop of Cyprus and head of the Cypriot Orthodox Church - was the Greek Cypriot Ethnarch, or ''de facto'' leader of the community. A highly influential figure well before independence, he participated in the 1955 Bandung Conference. After independence, Makarios took part in the 1961 founding meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade.Image:Cyprus representations.png|thumb|right|350px|Cyprus representations abroadresident embassy non-resident embassy diplomatic relations only, but no missionReasons for this neutrality may lie in the extreme pressures exerted on the infant Republic by its larger neighbours, Turkey and Greece. Intercommunal rivalries and movements for union with Greece or partial union with Turkey may have persuaded Makarios to steer clear of close affiliation with either side. In any case Cyprus became a high-profile member of the Non-Aligned Movement and retained its membership until its entry into the European Union in 2004. At the non-governmental level, Cyprus has also been a member of the popular extension of the Non-Aligned Movement, the Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organisation hosting several high-level meetings.Immediately after the 1974 Greek-sponsored coup d'état and the Turkish invasion, Makarios secured international recognition of his administration as the legitimate government of the whole island. This was disputed only by Turkey, which currently recognises only the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, established in 1983.Since the 1974 crisis, the chief aim of the foreign policy of the Republic of Cyprus has been to secure the withdrawal of Turkish forces and the reunification of the island under the most favourable constitutional and territorial settlement possible. This campaign has been pursued primarily through international forums such as the United Nations and the Non-Aligned Movement, and in recent years through the European Union.File:Dmitry Medvedev with Demetris Christofias-3.jpg|thumb|Presidents of Russia and Cyprus meet at least once every year.File:Demetris Christofias with Obamas.jpg|thumb|Cyprus president Dimitris Christofias and Cyprus first lady with U.S. President Barack Obama and Michelle ObamaTurkeyTurkey flatly refuses to recognize the government of the Republic of Cyprus, stating that the Republic - as established by the Constitution of 1960 - ceased to exist when the intercommunal violence that commenced in December 1963 ended Turkish Cypriot participation in the Cypriot government. The attempted coup in July 1974 - engineered by Greek Military Junta - was responded to by Turkey by a full military invasion, which resulted in the northern third of the island being occupied by Turkish military forces. This portion of Cyprus unilaterally declared independence in November 1983 as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), which Turkey recognizes. Turkey refers to the Republic of Cyprus government as "The Greek Cypriot Administration of South Cyprus."Cyprus takes the view that the TRNC government is a puppet administration, and thus prefers to negotiate with Turkey over the resolution of the Cyprus Problem. Turkey insists that the TRNC government is the institution that the RoC government must refer to in negotiations.Cyprus' accession to the European Union has had a negative impact on Turkey in regards to its own accession negotiations. The refusal of Turkey to allow Cypriot-flagged ships to access Turkish ports has resulted in a partial suspension of its accession negotiations. However Cyprus is in favor of Turkey's Accession to the EU with the hope it will facilitate a viable and just solution of the Cyprus Problem.Stephanos Constantinides and Jean Catsiapis Cyprus, Greece, Turkey.

Cyprus is represented in Norway through its embassy in Stockholm, Sweden, and 2 honorary consulates, one in Oslo and the second in Kristiansand. Norway is represented in Cyprus through its embassy in Athens, Greece, and an honorary consulate in Nicosia. Both countries are full members of the Council of Europe. Diplomatic relations were established on 22 March 1963.On 21 August 1951, there was a Consular Convention and an Exchange of Letters relating to establishing diplomatic relations. On 2 May 1951, there was a Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income. On 17 May 1962, there was an Exchange of Letters constituting an Agreement on the Abolition of Visa Requirement in Nicosia. On 5 March 1963, there was an Agreement on Commercial Scheduled Air Transport signed in London.The taxation levels in Cyprus are considerably lower than in Norway, and Cyprus has actively courted Norwegians to move to Cyprus. Among the Norwegians who moved to Cyprus is the shipping billionaire John Fredriksen, who was the richest man in Norway.In 1996 tax rules in Norway were changed to keep shipping companies competitive and under the Norwegian flag. By 2008 changes to the tonnage tax regime to harmonize them with the European Union forced some companies to register in Cyprus. Norwegian Service rig company Prosafe moved their headquarters to Cyprus.Several Norwegian retirees also moved to Cyprus; this too is largely to benefit from the lower tax rate on Cyprus and the minimal crime.|--valign="top"|Poland ||;;1960s||See Cyprus–Poland relations* Cyprus has an embassy in Warsaw and 2 honorary consulates (in Gdynia and Szczecin).* Poland has an embassy in Nicosia and an honorary consulate general in Limassol.* Both countries are full members of the European Union.|--valign="top"|Portugal ||;;|* Cyprus has an embassy in Lisbon (since 1999) and an honorary consulate in Porto.[Cyprus embassy in Lisbon]* Portugal has an embassy in Nicosia and an honorary consulate in Larnaca.* Both countries are full members of the European Union and of the Union for the Mediterranean.|--valign="top"|Romania ||;; 16 August 1960|* Romania has an embassy in Nicosia since November 1960.* Cyprus has an embassy in Bucharest.* Cyprus joined the European Union as a full member on 1 May 2004, while Romania joined on 1 January 2007.|--valign="top"|Russia ||;;||See Cyprus–Russia relations* The USSR established diplomatic relations with the newly independent Republic of Cyprus on 18 August 1960.* Cooperation between both countries has increased since the 1990s and the fall of the USSR.* Cyprus has an embassy in Moscow.* Russia has an embassy in Nicosia.|--valign="top"|Serbia ||;;||See Cyprus–Serbia relations* Cyprus has an embassy in Belgrade.* Serbia has an embassy and an honorary consulate in Nicosia* The two countries share common cultural and religious ascpects as both have major orthodox-Christian populations.[Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about relations with Cyprus]* The Cypriot Minister voiced his full support to Serbia's territorial integrity and EU integration, which should lead to full EU membership.|--valign="top"|Slovakia ||;;|* Cyprus is represented in Slovakia through its embassy in Vienna (Austria).* Slovakia has an embassy in Nicosia and an honorary consulate in Limassol.[Slovakian embassy in Nicosia]* Both countries are full members of the European Union.|--valign="top"|Slovenia ||;;|* Cyprus has an embassy in Ljubljana.* Slovenia is represented in Cyprus through its embassy in Athens, Greece, and through an honorary consulate in Limassol.* Both countries are members of the European Union and the Union for the Mediterranean.|--valign="top"|Spain ||;;25 December 1967|* Cyprus has an embassy in Madrid and 2 honorary consulates (in Bilbao and Granada).[Cyprus embassy in Madrid]* Spain has an embassy and an honorary consulate in Nicosia.[Spanish embassy in Nicosia (in Spanish only)]* Both countries are full members of the European Union and of the Union for the Mediterranean.|--valign="top"|Sweden ||;;||See Cyprus–Sweden relations* Sweden was one of the first countries that sent UN peacekeepers to Cyprus in 1964.* Since 1994, Cyprus has an embassy in Stockholm.[Cyprus embassy in Stockholm]* Sweden has an embassy and an honorary consulate in Nicosia.|--valign="top"|Ukraine ||;;|* The Cypriot embassy in Berlin (Germany) is also accredited as a non-resident embassy to Ukraine.
