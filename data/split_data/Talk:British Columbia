British ColumbiaPolitics in the IntroKinda curious why there's mention of court cases and the current premier, etc., etc. in the introduction.  It's an overload of information that isn't really friendly to the reader.It could be better put somewhere else.  Maybe instead, just list some stuff that BC is generally known for to outsiders, and then the nitty gritty details that only residents of BC are really familiar with can be included in other sections, like 'current events', 'controversy' or 'politics' or whatever.I recommend looking at the intro to the article on Montana, which describes it pretty well, with little bits of information that lead into the nitty gritty, such as general industry and economy information, as well as geography.

Should it be removed?--Special:Contributions/92.40.253.176|92.40.253.176 (talk) 15:43, 2 April 2013 (UTC):Punjabi also appears. 92.40.253.176 does not mention Punjabi.  â€” Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/86.169.110.150|86.169.110.150 (talk) 11:38, 21 May 2013 (UTC);; ;;::Removed it, clearly just qb nationalist silliness that has no place in the article. --Special:Contributions/60.255.0.19|60.255.0.19 (talk) 15:33, 19 April 2015 (UTC)University Endowment Lands in the Regional DistrictUnder the Cities section, the article states that "Also in the metropolitan area but not represented in the regional district are the University Endowment Lands."  But the UEL is in fact contained in and represented by GVRD Electoral Area A (stated in both these articles), which is of course a part of Metro Vancouver|Metro Vancouver/GVRD.  So perhaps this sentence should be removed, and two sentences back the wording should be "with adjacent unincorporated areas '''(including the University Endowment Lands)''' represented in the regional district as the electoral area known as Greater Vancouver Electoral Area A"?  If there are no complaints here I'll go ahead and make this change.

Will take lots of time to source all this so would love some help with trimming the section before I start sourcing stuff. -- Moxy (talk) 18:18, 13 April 2014 (UTC)CitationsThis article currently uses a mixture of templated and handwritten citations. I'd like to propose standardizing to the cite family of templates. Does anyone have any thoughts on this?
