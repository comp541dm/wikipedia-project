ContextI think when we talk about mythological, religious or literarycharacters, there should be a note of context. Is it in NorthernEuropeanMythology? I think because of the reference to Odin, butif id never heard of Odin either?Heh, editing a bit quick...Fixed now. If you note anything like this and know how to fix it, please do :-) -- Anders TorlindThe "Symbolism" sectionI think the whole "Symbolism" section should be removed. There are virtually no facts mentioned and it includes phrases like "We all know" and a rhetorical question. It sounds more like a school essay than an article in an encyclopedia. I can't say I'm thrilled with the section "Microcosmos" either ("our ancestors", "have always been regarded", associations not backed by facts etc.), in fact, I think that too should be removed.I am not saying we don't need these sections, but they should be written from an objective point of view and contain hard facts. Does anybody else feel this way?--Tail 10:25, 21 March 2006 (UTC):Agreed. Haukur 10:39, 21 March 2006 (UTC)Popular CultureCAD isn't popular culture; it's a bad webcomic drawn by a hack. Removing this section.

"The Askr and Embla Myth in a Comparative Perspective" in ''Old Norse in Long-Term Perspectives''. Nordic Academic Press. ISBN 918911681X. :bloodofox: (talk) 01:01, 7 October 2009 (UTC):I was wondering whether there was some source which raised a parallel with Adam and Eve (as first two humans?) Casliber (talk '''·''' Special:Contributions/Casliber|contribs) 19:53, 17 October 2009 (UTC)::I'm sure it's out there, and likely most of it falls into two categories: the rejected school of "they got it all from the Christians" and Christian-centric "Ask and Embla, you know, the Norse Adam and Eve" commentary. As far as I can tell, Ask and Embla and Adam and Eve don't really have anything in common outside of simply being legendary progenitors. Ask and Embla's ultimate origin in Proto-Indo-European religion seems to be pretty well established. :bloodofox: (talk) 00:55, 18 October 2009 (UTC):::Yeah, the more I thought about it, I think most religions have a first man-and-woman-type story. Be nice to have a discussion somewhere - maybe next time I see a full set of ''the Golden Bough'' somewhere...Casliber (talk '''·''' Special:Contributions/Casliber|contribs) 04:43, 18 October 2009 (UTC)One thing the article leaves out (unless I missed it somewhere) is which person is which gender. Is Ask or Embla the male or the female? I don't want to assume that Ask is the male just because that name comes first when the two are listed, or that Embla is female because her name is the second of the two. So which is which? Silmalel (talk) 19:42, 13 August 2010 (UTC):Good point, I'll correct that. Ask is male and Embla is female. :bloodofox: (talk) 21:25, 13 August 2010 (UTC)::Thanks for the clarification.
