AegirImage:Daughters of Ægir and Rán.jpg|thumb|250px|Ægir and his daughters brew ale in a large pot.In Norse mythology, '''Ægir''' (Old Norse "sea") is a sea jötunn associated with the ocean. He is also known for hosting elaborate parties for the Æsir|gods.Ægir's servants are Fimafeng (killed by Loki) and Eldir.DescriptionThe ''Nafnaþulur'' attached to the ''Prose Edda'' list Ægir as a giant. Richard Cleasby and Guðbrandur Vigfússon saw his name as pre-Norse, derived from an ancient Indo-European root.Cleasby, Vigfússon (1957:).AttestationsBoth ''Fundinn Noregr'' and Snorri Sturluson in ''Skáldskaparmál'' state that Ægir is the same as the sea-giant '''Hlér''', who lives on the isle of Hlesey|Hlésey, and this is borne out by kennings. Snorri uses his visiting the Æsir as the frame of that section of the Prose Edda.In ''Lokasenna'', Ægir hosts a party for the gods where he provides the ale brewed in an enormous pot or cauldron provided by Thor and Týr. The story of their obtaining the pot from the giant Hymir is told in ''Hymiskviða''.The prose introduction to ''Lokasenna'' and Snorri's list of kennings state that Ægir is also known as Gymir, who is Gerðr's father, but this is evidently an erroneous interpretation of kennings in which different giant-names are used interchangeably.FamilyFile:Ægir, ruler of the ocean.jpg|228px|rightAccording to ''Fundinn Noregr'', Ægir is a son of the giant Fornjótr, the king of Finland, Kvenland and Gotland, and brother of Logi ("fire") and Kári ("wind").Ægir's wife is Rán.
