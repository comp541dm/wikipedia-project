Definition"Thus, a broad grey, unnamed status has emerged between the concepts of "bachelor" and "married man.""Cohabitation, common-law. These are two names off the top of my head. Can something that has existed for the history of humanity be said to have recently emerged? Can a "status" exist between two "concepts?" This sentance is weird and I submit it be striken, or at least modified.Conflicted Bachelor?Someone explain or delete "Chris Bartlett, conflicted bachelor."

Nice try, however I could accuse someone of being a closet homosexual hiding behind their matrimonial status, but that would be hitting too close to the truth. Seriously. Capper01 04:54, 12 July 2007 (UTC):::There are many thousands of bachelors who are 100% straight. There are thousands of homosexuals who marry, often to try to pretend to people that they are straight. Whether or not a person is or was married to someone of the opposite sex does not prove their orientation. That some people use the term 'confirmed bachelor' as a euphemism for a homosexual man gives the false impression to some that a man who has never married, especially one who does not want to, must be a homo. Michael Winner is 100% straight, has had lots of women throughout his adult life; he has never married. Werdnawerdna (talk) 22:23, 21 September 2008 (UTC)::::At the same time, the term "confirmed bachelor" has long carried connotations (accurate or not) of homosexuality, and ignoring the connotation of a word essentially drags Wikipedia down to the level of a dictionary that contains only the literal meanings of a word and not the more subtle and complicated social and cultural implications.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Stepha (talk • Special:Contributions/Stepha|contribs) 00:02, 6 May 2011 (UTC);;; ;;Wikipedia is not a dictionary.I mean, one doesn't go to an encyclopedia to find out the meaning of the word "bachelor"; one uses a dictionary for that.

This of course makes "eligible bachelor" a pleonasm.  The category "bachelor" is also fuzzy at the edges: is a man in a long-term committed relationship a "bachelor"?  One would normally say no.  See --Macrakis 06:00, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC):Yes, but society knows that not all bachelors are ''worth'' marrying, hence the qualifier.  A rich man and a homeless guy might be equally available, but that doesn't mean they're both eligible -- or fit -- for marriage, if you're a woman. 69.239.236.37 15:03, 14 July 2007 (UTC):::To restrict the definition by a man's wealth is ludicrous. Whether or not a man fits the description of a bachelor has nothing to do with how much money he has. It does have a major bearing on how many women would want to marry him, and although it is a major factor, it is not the only one. Thousands of poor men marry every year. In any case, different people have different opinions as to where the line is drawn between poor and not poor. In addition, it is not rare for poor people's finances to improve significantly, nor for rich people's to decline considerably. Werdnawerdna (talk) 23:03, 21 September 2008 (UTC)::::It has been argued that 'marriageable' is part of the connotation, rather than denotation of 'bachelor'. Is the Pope a bachelor? Probably, but he's hardly a good example. This approach would be a prototype-style cognitive linguistic approach. Western Philosophy has traditionally had problems with defining this kind of word, exactly because of its fuzzy edges. Perhaps, "but marriageable" could be replaced by, "but of marriageable age" following the OED. But then, this isn't a dictionary. --Peter 12:59, 17 March 2006 (UTC)30th Birthday Custom in GermanySomeone has written in the wiki: "In some cultures, the 'punishment' of bachelors is no more than a teasing game. In small towns in Germany, for example, men who were still unmarried on their 30th birthday were made to sweep the stairs of the town hall until kissed by a virgin. This 'punishment' has now died out."I don't think this is entirely true, because I observed this custom in Münster in May 2006.:I agree. This custom is still in use. I personally know it from Braunschweig and Göttingen. Therefore it is also not limited to small towns.

For one, it's very long and little more than a list.  Second, it's a big target for vandalism/misinformation.  Finally, the word "famous" is very subjective and very broad.

However, I believe that no one currently alive should be here as there is always the possibility that they will get married in the future.  There is also the problem of some living people appearing in the "lifetime" section and others appearing in the "living" section, which is clearly inconsistent.Special:Contributions/76.241.88.94|76.241.88.94 (talk)::::I agree.  "Famous" dead bachelors should be listed here but there is no point in putting living ones here, since they may get married at any time.  And those who died unexpectedly and young (such as Heath Ledger) are not relevant because they might have married had they lived a long time.  Those of interest are those who lived to old age and never married. Special:Contributions/68.101.130.214|68.101.130.214 (talk) 09:47, 4 March 2008 (UTC):::::Section needs major cleanup. Special:Contributions/Chantessy|Chantessy 17:35, 30 May 2008 (UTC)::::::The section's name has been improved to notable bachelors, and everyone on the list has their own Wikipedia page. Therefore, they are all notable in Wikipedia's opinion; that's what matters here. The new title also prevents any disputes as to whether or not they qualify as famous. Both living and dead bachelors are, and should be, listed; they fit the description. In the event of any of the living bachelors on the list marrying, they should be removed from it. To restrict the list only to the dead, and/or to the elderly, should not happen. A 30 or 40 year-old never-married man is just as much a bachelor as a man aged 70 or 80 who has never married. To speculate as to whether an unmarried man will marry in the future, or whether a person who died relatively young would have, if he had lived considerably longer, is redundant. In every case of a man dying a bachelor, that fact can never change; he should be on the list. In the case of unmarried, living men, they should be on the list, and each one only removed from it if he marries. Werdnawerdna (talk) 22:53, 21 September 2008 (UTC):::::::Why has the list been put into alphabetial order of first name?

Evidence for this hypothesis is her close presence to him for so much of the latter part of his life, and her presence near him during and shortly after his death. It is unlikely that one woman, other than his wife, would have spent so much time around him, and for him to still be a hugely and widely respected rabbi in that era, in that part of the world. In addition, it would have been rare in that era and area, for a thirtysomething rabbi to be a bachelor - it would have been 'frowned upon'. The official line that Christian organisations state is that he definitely never married, and he was definitely celibate. They explain it by saying that he was a unique case, and never had any sexual relationships, in order to entirely devote his life to religion. However, he had an ordinary life until he was about 29, only spending the last (roughly) four years of his life doing what made him well-known. That contradicts not only that, but their obviously (scientifically proven) false claim that he was the son of God.

I believeas per our article on Talk:Women's rights in Saudi Arabia that in Saudia Arabia where sexual segregation is widely practices, 'bachelor', is generally used to refer to a section, like in a restaurant, for men by themselves (or with other men). These men may or may not be married with families, the point is the family (or at least female members) are not with them so they can use the bachelors section as there is no concern about inappropriate mixing and the term is obviously not perjorative nor only used for immigrants. I wonder then whether the may be used to refer to men by themselves withouth any family they may or may not have and fhe use higlighted in the sources arises from that.
