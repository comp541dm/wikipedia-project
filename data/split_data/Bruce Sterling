Bruce Sterling'''Michael Bruce Sterling''' (born April 14, 1954) is an American science fiction author known for his novels and work on the ''Mirrorshades'' anthology. This work helped to define the cyberpunk genre. faculty page at European Graduate SchoolWritingsSterling, along with William Gibson, Rudy Rucker, John Shirley, Lewis Shiner, and Pat Cadigan, is one of the founders of the cyberpunk movement in science fiction. In addition, he is one of the subgenre's chief ideological promulgators. This has earned him the nickname "Chairman Bruce". He was also one of the first organizers of the Turkey City Writer's Workshop, and is a frequent attendee at the Sycamore Hill Writer's Workshop. He won Hugo Awards for his novelettes ''Bicycle Repairman'' and ''Taklamakan''.His first novel, ''Involution Ocean'', published in 1977, features the world Nullaqua where all the atmosphere is contained in a single, miles-deep crater. The story concerns a ship sailing on the ocean of dust at the bottom, which hunts creatures called dustwhales that live beneath the surface. It is partially a science-fictional pastiche of ''Moby-Dick'' by Herman Melville.From the late 1970s onwards, Sterling wrote a series of stories set in the Shaper/Mechanist universe: the solar system is colonised, with two major warring factions. The Mechanists use a great deal of computer-based mechanical technologies; the Shapers do genetic engineering on a massive scale. The situation is complicated by the eventual contact with alien civilizations; humanity eventually splits into many subspecies, with the implication that many of these effectively vanish from the galaxy, reminiscent of The Singularity in the works of Vernor Vinge. The Shaper/Mechanist stories can be found in the collection ''Crystal Express'' and the collection ''Schismatrix Plus'', which contains the original novel ''Schismatrix'' and all of the stories set in the Shaper/Mechanist universe. Alastair Reynolds identified ''Schismatrix'' and the other Shaper/Mechanist stories as one of the greatest influences on his own work.File:Bruce Sterling at ARE 2010.jpg|thumb|Bruce Sterling at the 2010 Augmented Reality EventIn the 1980s, Sterling edited the science fiction critical fanzine ''Cheap Truth'' under the alias of Vincent Omniaveritas. He wrote a column called ''Catscan'' for the now-defunct science fiction critical magazine ''SF Eye''.He contributed a chapter to ''Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture'' (The MIT Press, 2008) edited by Paul D. Miller a.k.a. DJ Spooky. He also contributed, along with Lewis Shiner, to the short story "Mozart in Mirrorshades".From April 2009 through May 2009, he was an editor at Cool Tools.Since October 2003 Sterling has blogged at ["Beyond the Beyond"], which is hosted by ''Wired''.His most recent novel (as of 2013) is ''Love Is Strange'' (December 2012), a Paranormal Romance (40k).ProjectsHe has been the instigator of three projects which can be found on the Web -* The Dead Media Project - A collection of "research notes" on dead media technologies, from Incan quipus, through Victorian phenakistoscopes, to the departed video game and home computers of the 1980s. The Project's homepage, including Sterling's original ''Dead Media Manifesto'' can be found at * The Viridian Design Movement - his attempt to create a "green" design movement focused on high-tech, stylish, and ecologically sound design. The Viridian Design home page, including Sterling's ''Viridian Manifesto'' and all of his ''Viridian Notes'', is managed by Jon Lebkowsky at The Viridian Movement helped to spawn the popular "bright green" environmental weblog Worldchanging. WorldChanging contributors include many of the original members of the Viridian "curia".* Embrace the Decay - a web-only art piece commissioned by the LA Museum of Contemporary Art in 2003., ''moca.org'' Incorporating contributions solicited through The Viridian Design 'movement', Embrace the Decay was the most visited piece/page at LA MOCA's Digital Gallery, and included contributions from Jared Tarbell of [levitated.net] and co-author of several books on advanced Flash programming, and Monty Zukowski, creator of the winning 'decay algorithm' sponsored by Bruce.NeologismsSterling has a habit of coining neologisms to describe things which he believes will be common in the future, especially items which already exist in limited numbers.* In the December 2005 issue of Wired magazine, Sterling coined the term buckyjunk. Buckyjunk refers to future, difficult-to-recycle consumer waste made of carbon nanotubes (a.k.a. buckytubes, based on buckyballs or buckminsterfullerene).* In July 1989, in ''SF Eye #5'', he was the first to use the word "slipstream" to refer to a type of speculative fiction between traditional science fiction and fantasy and mainstream literature.* In December 1999 he coined the term "Wexelblat disaster", for a disaster caused when a natural disaster triggers a secondary, and more damaging, failure of human technology.* In his book ''Zeitgeist'' (2000), he introduced the term Major consensus narrative as an explanatory synonym for truth.* In August 2004 he suggested a type of technological device (he called it "spime") that, through pervasive RFID and GPS tracking, can track its history of use and interact with the world.* In the speech where he offered "spime", he noted that the term "blobject", with which he is sometimes credited, was passed on to him by industrial designer Karim Rashid. The term may originally have been coined by Steven Skov Holt.* He discussed and expanded on Sophia Al Maria's  neologism  "Gulf Futurism" in his column for Wired Magazine "Beyond The Beyond"PersonalImage:Bruce Sterling at Robofest.jpg|thumb|Sterling at Robofest '94In childhood, Sterling spent several years in India; today he has a notable fondness for Bollywood films.
