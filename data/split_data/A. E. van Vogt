Until he was four years old, van Vogt and his family spoke only a dialect of Low German in the home.Panshin, Alexei ["Man Beyond Man. The Early Stories of A. E. van Vogt" (page 1)]. Retrieved August 29, 2010. Van Vogt's father, a lawyer, moved his family several times and his son found these moves difficult, remarking in later life:After starting his writing career by writing for true-confession style pulp magazines such as ''True Story'', van Vogt decided to switch to writing something he enjoyed, science fiction.Elliot, Jeffery: "An Interview with A. E. Van Vogt", Science Fiction Review #23, 1977. Available online Retrieved on August 29, 2010 This happened after he casually picked up the August 1938 issue of ''Astounding Science Fiction'' from a newsstand and found the story "Who Goes There?" The story inspired him to write "Vault of the Beast", which he sent to the same magazine. It was rejected, but the rejection letter encouraged him to try again. He then sent in a new story called "The Black Destroyer," which was accepted. A rewritten version of "Vault of the Beast" would be published in 1940.van Vogt's "Ship of Darkness" was the cover story in the second issue of ''Fantasy Book'' in 1948Van Vogt's first SF publication was inspired by ''The Voyage of the Beagle'' by Charles Darwin. "The Black Destroyer" was published by John W. Campbell in ''Astounding Science Fiction'', July 1939, the centennial year of Darwin's journal. It featured a fierce, carnivorous alien, the coeurl, stalking the crew of an exploration spaceship. The second Space Beagle story appeared in December, "Discord in Scarlet". Each was the cover story["The Voyage of the Space Beagle"] (cover images for numerous editions and adaptations of "The Black Destroyer" and its series). ''The Weird Worlds of A. E. van Vogt''.

Connecticut: The Easton Press.;; Quote: "His first published SF story was "Black Destroyer" in the July 1939 ''Astounding''. Not only was "Black Destroyer" pictured on the cover of the magazine, but it would be recognized as one of the most significant stories published in ''Astounding'' that year". (Van Vogt and Kramer thus debuted in the issue of ''Astounding'' that is sometimes singled out for ushering in the "Golden Age" of science fiction.For example, Peter Nicholls () says "The beginning of Campbell's particular Golden Age of SF can be pinpointed as the summer of 1939" and goes on to begin the discussion with the July 1939 issue. Lester del Rey () comments that "July was the turning point".) The former story served as the inspiration for a number of science fiction movies.In 1950, the two were combined with two other stories as a fix-up novel, ''The Voyage of the Space Beagle'' (Simon ; Schuster), which was published in at least five European languages by 1955.isfdbPositing the need for exobiologists who will appreciate the differences between the inhabitants of other planets and ourselves, it stresses the importance of the civilian rather than military in exploration of other cultures.Van Vogt's first completed novel, and one of his most famous, is ''Slan'' (Arkham House, 1946), which Campbell serialized in ''Astounding'' September to December 1940.isfdbUsing what became one of van Vogt's recurring themes, it told the story of a 9-year-old superman living in a world in which his kind are slain by ''Homo sapiens''.In 1941, van Vogt decided to become a full-time writer, quitting his job at the Canadian Department of National Defence. Extremely prolific for a few years, van Vogt wrote a large number of short stories. In the 1950s, many of them were retrospectively patched together into novels, or "fixups" as he called them, a term that entered the vocabulary of science-fiction criticism. When the original stories were related (e.g., ''The War against the Rull'') this was often successful. When not (e.g., ''Quest for the Future'') the disparate stories thrown together generally made for a less coherent plot.Post-war philosophyIn 1944, van Vogt moved to Hollywood, California, where his writing took on new dimensions after World War II. Van Vogt was always interested in the idea of all-encompassing systems of knowledge (akin to modern meta-systems)—the characters in his very first story used a system called "Nexialism" to analyze the alien's behavior, and he became interested in the general semantics of Alfred Korzybski.He subsequently wrote three novels merging these overarching themes, ''The World of Null-A'' and ''The Pawns of Null-A'' in the late 1940s, and ''Null-A Three'' in the early 1980s. ''Null-A'', or non-Aristotelian logic, refers to the capacity for, and practice of, using intuitive, inductive reasoning (compare fuzzy logic), rather than reflexive, or conditioned, deductive reasoning.Van Vogt was also profoundly affected by revelations of totalitarian police states that emerged after World War II. He wrote a mainstream novel that was set in Communist China, ''The Violent Man'' (1962); he said that to research this book he had read 100 books about China. Into this book he incorporated his view of "the violent male type", which he described as a "man who had to be right", a man who "instantly attracts women" and who he said were the men who "run the world"."HLDrake"At the same time, in his fiction, van Vogt was consistently sympathetic to absolute monarchy as a form of government. This was the case, for instance, in the ''Weapon Shop'' series, the ''Mixed Men'' series, and in single stories such as "Heir Apparent" (1945), whose protagonist was described as a "benevolent dictator".Van Vogt systematized his writing method, using scenes of 800 words or so where a new complication was added or something resolved. Several of his stories hinge on temporal conundra, a favorite theme. He stated that he acquired many of his writing techniques from three books: ''Narrative Technique'' by Thomas Uzzell, ''The Only Two Ways to Write a Story'' by John Gallishaw, and ''Twenty Problems of the Fiction Writer'' by Gallishaw.panshinHe also claimed many of his ideas came from dreams; throughout his writing life he arranged to be awakened every 90minutes during his sleep period so he could write down his dreams.Platt, Charles, ["A. E. van Vogt – A Profile"]. From ''Who Writes Science Fiction?'' (London: Savoy Books, 1980); ''Dream Makers: The Uncommon People Who Write Science Fiction'' (Berkeley Books, 1980).In 1950, van Vogt was briefly appointed as head of L. Ron Hubbard's Dianetics operation in California. Dianetics was the secular precursor to Hubbard's Church of Scientology. The operation went broke nine months later, but never went bankrupt, due to van Vogt's arrangements with creditors. Van Vogt and his wife opened their own Dianetics centre, partly financed by his writings, until he "signed off" around 1961. At the time of his interview with Charles Platt,plattvan Vogt was still president of the Californian Association of Dianetic Auditors.In 1951, he published "The Weapon Shops of Isher", a true science fiction classic with strong political overtones. Between 1950 and 1960, van Vogt produced collections, notable fixups such as: ''The Mixed Men'' (1952) and ''The War Against the Rull'' (1959), and the two "Clane" novels, ''Empire of the Atom'' (1957) and ''The Wizard of Linn'' (1962), which were inspired (like Asimov's Foundation series) by the decline of the Roman Empire, specifically during the reign of Claudius. He resumed writing again in the 1960s, mainly at Frederik Pohl's invitation. His later novels included fixups such as ''The Beast'' (a.k.a. ''Moonbeast'') (1963), ''Rogue Ship'' (1965), ''Quest for the Future'' (1970) and ''Supermind'' (1977); expanded short stories (''The Darkness on Diamondia'' (1972), ''Future Glitter'' (a.k.a. ''Tyranopolis'') (1973); original novels such as ''Children of Tomorrow'' (1970), ''The Battle of Forever'' (1971) and ''The Anarchistic Colossus'' (1977); plus sequels to his classic works, many of which were promised, but only one of which appeared, ''Null-A Three'' (1984; originally published in French). Several later books were original in Europe, and at least one novel has only ever appeared in Italian, no English version yet published.On January 26, 2000, van Vogt died in Los Angeles, United States from Alzheimer's disease and was survived by his second wife, the former Lydia Bereginsky.Critical receptionCritical opinion about the quality of van Vogt's work has been sharply divided.One early and articulate critic was then-23-year-old Damon Knight. In a 1945 chapter-long essay reprinted in ''In Search of Wonder,''DKentitled "Cosmic Jerrybuilder: A. E. van Vogt", Knight famously remarked that van Vogt "is no giant; he is a pygmy who has learned to operate an overgrown typewriter". Knight described ''The World of Null-A'' as "one of the worst allegedly adult science fiction stories ever published". About van Vogt's writing, Knight said:In general van Vogt seems to me to fail consistently as a writer in these elementary ways: 1. His plots do not bear examination. 2. His choice of words and his sentence-structure are fumbling and insensitive. 3. He is unable either to visualize a scene or to make a character seem real.About ''Empire of the Atom'' Knight wrote:Knight also expressed misgivings about van Vogt's politics, noting that his stories almost invariably present absolute monarchy in a favorable light. But in 1974, he went partly back on his criticism after finding out about Vogt's working methods about writing down his dreams:[Notes, Reports, and Correspondence - DePauw University]This explains a good deal about the stories, and suggests that it is really useless to attack them by conventional standards. If the stories have a dream consistency which affects readers powerfully, it is probably irrelevant that they lack ordinary consistency.On the other hand, when science fiction author Philip K. Dick was asked ["Vertex Interviews Philip K. Dick"]. ''Vertex'', Vol. 1, no. 6, February 1974. which science fiction writers had influenced his work the most, he replied:Dick also defended van Vogt against Damon Knight’s criticisms:Damon feels that it's bad artistry when you build those funky universes where people fall through the floor. It's like he's viewing a story the way a building inspector would when he's building your house. But reality really is a mess, and yet it's exciting. The basic thing is, how frightened are you of chaos? And how happy are you with order? Van Vogt influenced me so much because he made me appreciate a mysterious chaotic quality in the universe which is not to be feared.In a review of ''Transfinite: The Essential A.E. van Vogt'', science fiction writer Paul Di Filippo said:In ''The John W. Campbell Letters'', Campbell says, "The son-of-a-gun gets hold of you in the first paragraph, ties a knot around you, and keeps it tied in every paragraph thereafter—including the ultimate last one".Harlan Ellison (who began reading van Vogt as a teenager)Ellison, Harlan (June 1999), .

Quote: "Van is still with us, as I write this, in June of 1999, slightly less than fifty years since I first encountered van Vogt prose in a January 1950 issue of ''Startling Stories'' ...." wrote, "Van was the first writer to shine light on the restricted ways in which I had been taught to view the universe and the human condition"."HLDrake"Writing in 1984 David Hartwell said:The literary critic Leslie A. Fiedler said something similar:Fiedler, Leslie A. (1983), "The Criticism of Science Fiction", ''Coordinates: Placing Science Fiction and Fantasy'', ed. George E. Slusser, Eric S. Rabkin, and Robert Scholes (Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois University Press), pages 10-11. ISBN 978-0-8093-1105-7.Van Vogt is a test case, ...since an apology for or analysis of science fiction which fails to come to terms with his appeal and major importance, defends or defines the genre by falsifying it.The American literary critic Fredric Jameson says of van Vogt:Nevertheless, van Vogt still has his critics. For example, Darrell Schweitzer writing to ''The New York Review of Science Fiction'' in 1999Schweitzer, Darrell (1999), "Letters of Comment", ''The New York Review of Science Fiction'', May 1999, Number 129, Vol. 11, No. 9. quoted a passage from the original van Vogt novelette "The Mixed Men", which he was then reading, and remarked:RecognitionIn 1946, van Vogt and his first wife, Edna Mayne Hull, were Guests of Honor at the fourth World Science Fiction Convention.In 1980, van Vogt received a "Casper Award" (precursor to the Canadian Prix Aurora Awards) for Lifetime Achievement.SFAwardsThe Science Fiction Writers of America named him its 14th Grand Master in 1995 (presented 1996).SFWAThere had been great controversy within SFWA regarding its long wait in bestowing its highest honor (limited to living writers, no more than one annuallySFWA). Writing an obituary of van Vogt, Robert J. Sawyer, a fellow Canadian writer of science fiction remarked:It is generally held that the "damnable SFWA politics" concerns Damon Knight, the founder of the SFWA, who abhorred van Vogt's style and politics and thoroughly demolished his literary reputation in the 1950s.Hartwell, David: "The Way We Were: A. E. van Vogt, 1912-2000", ''The New York Review of Science Fiction'', March 2000, Number 139, Vol. 12, No. 7, page 24.Harlan Ellison was more explicit in 1999 introduction to ''Futures Past: The Best Short Fiction of A. E. van Vogt'':"harlan"In 1996, van Vogt received a Special Award from the World Science Fiction Convention "for six decades of golden age science fiction".SFAwardsThat same year, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted him in its inaugural class of two deceased and two living persons, along with writer Jack Williamson (also living) and editors Hugo Gernsback and John W. Campbell.sfhof-oldThe works of van Vogt were translated into French by the surrealist Boris Vian (''The World of Null-A'' as ''Le Monde des Å'' in 1958), and van Vogt's works were "viewed as great literature of the surrealist school".Watson, Ian (1999), "Science Fiction, Surrealism, and Shamanism", ''The New York Review of Science Fiction'', June 1999, Number 130, Vol. 11, No. 10, page 9. In addition, 'Slan' was published in French, translated by Jean Rosenthal, under the title ''À la poursuite des Slans'', as part of the paperback series 'Editions J'ai Lu: Romans-Texte Integral' in 1973, this edition also listing the following works by van Vogt as having been published in French as part of this series: ''Le Monde des Å'', ''La faune de l'espace'', ''Les joueurs du Å'', ''L'empire de l'atome'', ''Le sorcier de Linn'', ''Les armureries d'Isher'', ''Les fabricants d'armes'', and ''Le livre de Ptath''.À la poursuite des Slans, A. E. Van Vogt, Editions J'ai Lu, 31, rue de Tournon, Paris-VIe, 1973QuotesConcerning Theodore Sturgeon's death, van Vogt commented:"HLDrake"Sturgeon had accepted the idea of dying. I thought: 'Well, I presume that when my time comes, it will also happen to me.' Because, we recognize that there is an end to human life. Now, it is my intention to postpone this moment as long as possible.
