'''Active Server Pages''' ('''ASP'''), later known as '''Classic ASP''' or '''ASP Classic''', is Microsoft's first server-side script engine for dynamically generated web pages. ASP.NET, first released in January 2002, has superseded ASP.HistoryInitially released as an add-on to Internet Information Services (IIS) via the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack (ca. 1996), it is included as a free component of Windows Server (since the initial release of Windows 2000 Server). There have been three versions of ASP, each introduced with different versions of IIS:* ASP 1.0 was released on December 1996 as part of IIS 3.0* ASP 2.0 was released on September 1997 as part of IIS 4.0* ASP 3.0 was released on November 2000 as part of IIS 5.0ASP 2.0 provides six built-in objects: Application, ASPError, Request, Response, Server, and Session. Session object, for example, represents a session that maintains the state of variables from page to page.The session data is kept server-side, the ID is saved as a . Source: , Microsoft The Active Scripting engine's support of the Component Object Model (COM) enables ASP websites to access functionality in compiled libraries such as DLLs.ASP 3.0 does not differ greatly from ASP 2.0 but it does offer some additional enhancements such as Server.Transfer method, Server.Execute method, and an enhanced ASPError object. ASP 3.0 also enables buffering by default and optimized the engine for better performance.ASP remains supported until 14 January 2020 on Windows 7. The use of ASP pages will be supported on Windows 8 for a minimum of 10 years from the Windows 8 release date.":0"ArchitectureASP use server-side scripting to generate contents that would be sent to the visitor's web browser. The ASP interpreter reads and executes all script code between  tags, the result of which is content generation. These scripts are written using VBScript, JScript and PerlScript. The @Language directive, the  syntax or server configuration can be used to select the language. In the example below, Response.Write Now() is in an HTML page; it would be dynamically replaced by the current time of the server.{|! Server side !! What client receives|- style="vertical-align:top"|The server's current time:;%Response.Write Now()%;;/syntaxhighlight;|The server's current time:8/11/2015 6:24:45 PM;/syntaxhighlight;|}Web pages with the ''.asp'' filename extension use ASP, although some web sites disguise their choice of scripting language for security purposes by using the more common ''.htm'' or ''.html'' extensions. Pages with the ''.aspx'' extension use compiled ASP.NET; however, ASP.NET pages may still include some ASP scripting. The introduction of ASP.NET led to use of the term ''Classic ASP'' for the original technology.ASP runs only on Windows.  A number of products emulate some of the functionality of Classic ASP on non-Microsoft web servers.  Apache::ASP for example ports Classic ASP to the Apache Web Server, but can only interpret PerlScript.Sun Java System ASP (formerly ChiliSoft ASP) was a popular and reportedly complete emulator, but it has been discontinued.The Request objectAllows data to be read that was sent by the client browser: Form, Querystring, and . It also provides information on the server, the client browser, and retrieve  stored on the visitor's machine. Can retrieve data from a form using both methods :Request.Form reads data sent by POST.Request.QueryString reads data sent by GET.;%Response.Write "Welcome " ; Server.HTMLEncode(Request.QueryString("name")) ; "!"%;;/source;The Response objectCan send information to the client, such as the writing of the text on a page or .;%If Len(Request.QueryString("name")) ; 0 ThenResponse.Cookies("name") = Request.QueryString("name")End IfResponse.Write "Welcome " ; Server.HTMLEncode(Response.Cookies("name")) ; "!"%;;/source;The Server objectAllows connections to databases (ADO), filesystem, and use of components installed on the server.;%Dim oAdoCon, oAdoRec, oAdoStm, oCdoCon, oCdoMsg, oSciDic, oSciFsm, oMswAdrSet oAdoCon = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Connection")Set oAdoRec = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Recordset")Set oAdoStm = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Stream")Set oCdoCon = Server.CreateObject("CDO.Configuration")Set oCdoMsg = Server.CreateObject("CDO.Message")Set oSciDic = Server.CreateObject("Scripting.Dictionary")Set oSciFsm = Server.CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")Set oMswAdr = Server.CreateObject("MSWC.AdRotator")%;;/source;The Application objectStores global variables.;%Application("Ali") = "My ASP Application"Response.Write "Welcome to " ; Server.HTMLEncode(Application("Ali")) ; "!"%;;/source;The Session objectStores variables accessible only to a single visitor.;%If Len(Request.QueryString("name")) ; 0 ThenSession("name") = Request.QueryString("name")End IfResponse.Write "Welcome " ; Server.HTMLEncode(Session("name")) ; "!"%;;/source;The Err objectAllows for the management of errors.;%On Error Resume NextResponse.Write 1 / 0 ' Division by zeroIf Err.Number  0 ThenResponse.Write "Error Code: " ; Server.HTMLEncode(Err.Number) ; ""Response.Write "Error Source: " ; Server.HTMLEncode(Err.Source) ; ""Response.Write "Error Description: " ; Server.HTMLEncode(Err.Description) ; ""Err.ClearEnd If%;;/source;See also* Template processor* PHP* Common Gateway InterfaceReferencesExternal links;;Active Server Pages
