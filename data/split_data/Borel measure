In mathematics, specifically in measure theory, a '''Borel measure''' on  a topological space is a measure that is defined on all open sets (and thus on all Borel sets).D. H. Fremlin, 2000. ''[Measure Theory]''. Torres Fremlin. Some authors require additional restrictions on the measure, as described below.Formal definitionLet ''X'' be a locally compact Hausdorff space, and let \mathfrak{B}(X) be the smallest σ-algebra that contains the open sets of ''X''; this is known as the σ-algebra of Borel sets.  A '''Borel measure''' is any measure ''μ'' defined on the σ-algebra of Borel sets. Some authors require in addition that ''μ''(''C'');∞ for every compact set''C''. If a Borel measure ''μ'' is both inner regular and outer regular, it is called a '''regular Borel measure''' (some authors also require it to be tight). If ''μ'' is both inner regular and locally finite, it is called a Radon measure. Note that a locally finite Borel measure automatically satisfies ''μ''(''C'');∞ for every compact set''C''.On the real lineThe real line \mathbb R with its usual topology is a locally compact Hausdorff space, hence we can define a Borel measure on it. In this case, \mathfrak{B}(\mathbb R) is the smallest σ-algebra that contains the open intervals of \mathbb R. While there are many Borel measures μ, the choice of Borel measure which assigns \mu([a,b])=b-a for every interval [a,b] is sometimes called "the" Borel measure on \mathbb R. In practice, even "the" Borel measure is not the most useful measure defined on the σ-algebra of Borel sets; indeed, the Lebesgue measure \lambda is an extension of "the" Borel measure which possesses the crucial property that it is a complete measure (unlike the Borel measure). To clarify, when one says that the Lebesgue measure \lambda is an extension of the Borel measure \mu, it means that every Borel-measurable set ''E'' is also a Lebesgue-measurable set, and the Borel measure and the Lebesgue measure coincide on the Borel sets (i.e., \lambda(E)=\mu(E) for every Borel measurable set).Product spacesIf ''X'' and ''Y'' are second-countable, Hausdorff topological spaces, then the set of Borel subsets B(X\times Y) of their product coincides with the product of the sets B(X)\times B(Y) of Borel subsets of ''X'' and ''Y''.Vladimir I.

The Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure is a regular Borel measure, and conversely every regular Borel measure on the real line is of this kind.Laplace transformLaplace transformOne can define the Laplace transform of a finite Borel measure μ on the real line by the Lebesgue integral: (\mathcal{L}\mu)(s) = \int_{[0,\infty)} e^{-st}\,d\mu(t).An important special case is where μ is a probability measure or, even more specifically, the Dirac delta function. In operational calculus, the Laplace transform of a measure is often treated as though the measure came from a distribution function ''f''.  In that case, to avoid potential confusion, one often writes: (\mathcal{L}f)(s) = \int_{0^-}^\infty e^{-st}f(t)\,dtwhere the lower limit of 0− is shorthand notation for: \lim_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0}\int_{-\varepsilon}^\infty.This limit emphasizes that any point mass located at 0 is entirely captured by the Laplace transform.  Although with the Lebesgue integral, it is not necessary to take such a limit, it does appear more naturally in connection with the Laplace–Stieltjes transform.Hausdorff dimension and Frostman's lemmaFrostman's lemmaGiven a Borel measure μ on a metric space ''X'' such that μ(''X'') ; 0 and μ(''B''(''x'', ''r'')) ≤ ''rs'' holds for some constant ''s'' ; 0 and for every ball ''B''(''x'', ''r'') in ''X'', then the Hausdorff dimension dimHaus(''X'') ≥ ''s''. A partial converse is provided by Frostman's lemma:'''Lemma:''' Let ''A'' be a Borel subset of '''R'''''n'', and let ''s'';0. Then the following are equivalent:*''H''''s''(''A'');0, where ''H''''s'' denotes the ''s''-dimensional Hausdorff measure.*There is an (unsigned) Borel measure '';mu;'' satisfying '';mu;''(''A'');0, and such that::\mu(B(x,r))\le r^s:holds for all ''x'';isin;'''R'''''n'' and ''r'';0.Cramér–Wold theoremThe Cramér–Wold theorem in measure theory states that a Borel probability measure on R^k is uniquely determined by the totality of its one-dimensional projections. It is used as a method for proving joint convergence results. The theorem is named after Harald Cramér and Herman Ole Andreas Wold.ReferencesFurther reading* .***External links
