;;This is a very poorly written article full of misinformation and a lot of speculation and nonsense.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/23.16.114.177|23.16.114.177 (talk) 00:12, 11 October 2015 (UTC);;; ;;Oriental black metalI've been thinking mentioning Melechesh, Salem, Arallu, Al-Namrood and similar bands in this article – proposed text  [changed link] (adapted from this). What do you think? Please, suggest me what should I add, remove or reword in that text. Nite-Sirk (talk) 03:41, 22 June 2013 (UTC):I know their names (of course) but not every mentioned band’s music, and I don’t know about Oriental Black Metal being mentioned as USBM, NSBM, DSBM and all these other nonsense terms (though you didn’t claim that). Is there any such thing as a common musical style (see e.g. Greek bands) e.g. due to scales they use, or something else they have in common besides being Oriental and being called Black Metal? If yes, they deserve a mention in the subgenre section, but I don’t think so. So I would include them somewhere in the history just as I included NSBM, the USA, those who “went deeper into the abyss”, and others. There is a Middle East section, so maybe you can find some way to combine these (I think only Salem predated the second wave [as did Mortuary Drape, who are mentioned in a paragraph about Italy in the post-second wave section], and most bands came after it). --217/83;06:23, 22 June 2013 (UTC)::My idea is precisely to add these somewhere in the history section. Since Salem and Mortuary Drape were formed in 1985 and 1986, respectively, they probably should be mentioned in the first wave section; Langsuyr, Melechesh, Odious, Arallu and Al-Namrood should be added before the paragraph about the anti-Islamic bands. Would this be okay? And now that I think about it, this article also needs to mention Parabellum, Reencarnación (band)|Reencarnación and Inquisition from Colombia. Also, the article about Ayat needs some work. Could you help with sourcing it? Nite-Sirk (talk) 19:34, 22 June 2013 (UTC):::If the phrases about Salem and Mortuary Drape refer to the time after 1986 (as I assume), it’s better to add them to the section about the time between the first two waves, alongside Morbid Angel (formed in 1984 as you know), Tormentor (formed in 1986 but notably mostly for their second demo released in 1988), Master’s Hammer etc. For the rest, do as you want. If there is any problem, we can still discuss this, can’t we? I’ll see what I can do for the Ayat article; there is nothing on the German ''Rock Hard'' and ''Legacy'' sites but I found a ''Metal Hammer'' feature. I will probably add it to the article this afternoon or evening. --217/83;13:59, 23 June 2013 (UTC)::::Just added some information about Sabbat (Japan), Parabellum, Reencarnación, Salem, Mortuary Drape, Sigh, Melechesh, Arallu, Odious, Al-Namrood and Langsuyr (diff). What do you think? And thank you for your changes to the Ayat article. Nite-Sirk (talk) 22:09, 23 June 2013 (UTC):::::I'm not sure what it really adds to the article. Notability should be the determining factor here—that is, have these bands sparked a major movement within the genre or within their respective countries, or are they just marginal curiosities? Singular bands may be notable enough for their own articles, but I'm not sure that namedropping a bunch of bands just because they happen to be from other countries is really all that relevant. Maybe a few are significant enough, but this seems like an awful lot, and the number of redlinks is somewhat concerning. ~~ Lothar von Richthofen (talk) 22:23, 24 June 2013 (UTC)::::::Which of the bands I added do you feel aren't notable enough for the history section? Nite-Sirk (talk) 03:20, 25 June 2013 (UTC):::::::I agree with Lothar.:::::::Nite-Sirk, I appreciate the work you've done, but you've added '''far''' too much detail on these bands. The amount of detail should depend on the band's notability. Venom and Bathory—two of the founders of black metal—have a paragraf each, which is more than what bands like Darkthrone, Immortal and Emperor have. If we can't show why a band or a group of bands is noteworthy, then we shouldn't be namedropping them. A lot of trimming needs to be done.

I was considering AFD at first as it didn't seem notable enough for its own article, but decided to open up a discussion on merging it here instead. Thoughts? Fezmar9 (talk) 20:14, 31 March 2015 (UTC):I agree. It should be merged to particularly to Black metal#Stylistic divisions. Myxomatosis57 (talk) 22:05, 31 March 2015 (UTC)::Sure, that article has no references at all and the genre nas no notability itself, if that's even a legit genre, which nothing seems to indicate that. ABC paulista (talk) 23:28, 31 March 2015 (UTC):::Online sources are extremely limited. Exclaim wrote a small write-up on the genre and there are a couple of reviews from reliable sources like Consequence of Sound and Chart that use the term. However, other publications like Now and Treble basically suggest the genre is kind of made up. That's basically all I could find online; print sources may exist. Fezmar9 (talk) 00:33, 1 April 2015 (UTC)::::The genre is also known as "post-black metal." (Some other articles featuring the term: , , , , , ). As far as I understand, this term is also used for "contemporary black metal bands that take influences from genres unorthodox to black metal," yet it produces more results. Still, the information is indeed limited and many of the online articles merely mention the term. Also I've just realized that the genre has an article on German Wikipedia and it appears to have enough content to fill in an article; however, I can't really tell whether all those sources are brought up together with original research or not.

MetalSucks's one does cite Growl, but it also states that its a more common trait to Death Metal, and it's uncommon for Black Metal unlike shrieking: ''"Though black metal is more known for rasping and shrieking, founding member/vocalist/bassist Venien provides a gruff death metal roar"'':The lead and ''Characteristics'' sections are for the most proeminent characteristics, and no sources in this article supports/states that Death Growl is a proeminent Black Metal characteristic.
