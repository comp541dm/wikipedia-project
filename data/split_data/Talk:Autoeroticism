Would narcissism be considered a form of autoeroticism? Perhaps it's a stretch, but it seems to fit... Of course, I would have to add the explicit clarification that narcissism would be a sub group of the various types of autoeroticisms.--BlackGriffen:I don't know if it's a form of autoeroticism, but it's certainly related. Maybe a mention and a link. --Dmerrill----Merger* '''Don't Merge''': Autoeroticism and autosexuality are entirely different things.  Autoeroticism can occurs in a homo-, hetero-, bisexual orientation, etc.  Autosexuality is usually (but not always) a orientation parallel to those aforementioned. --Zippanova 19:29, 29 July 2005 (UTC)* '''I second that''': I'd say why, but I'd be repeating what's been said above. MessedRocker 03:50, August 15, 2005 (UTC)* '''Don't merge''': one article is about the practice of self-gratification, the other is about a preference for self-gratification.  These topics are only similar on the surface. --Icarus 09:48, 18 September 2005 (UTC)*Oops, I didn't know there was a discussion going on before I merged, until it ws brought to my attention by Icarus. However, autoeroticism is a physical manifestation of autosexuality. Obviously, if most want to de-merge, then go ahead. Brisvegas 07:24, 9 October 2005 (UTC)It seems pretty irrelevant to have autofellatio linked to there and discussed as requiring flexibility, etc. or at least, somewhat sexist.  no?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/207.216.53.189|207.216.53.189 (talk) 07:53, 27 September 2008 (UTC);; ;;Undoing this consensus-free mergeHi folks. I have undone this old merge, which seems to have been carried out without consensus.Autoeroticism is stimulating yourself sexually. Almost everyone does this, and almost none of the people who do it are subject to the unusual paraphilia of autosexuality, which means being ''attracted'' to yourself sexually. Your average teenage boy thinks about a girl, feels attracted to her, and then beats off. He doesn't say "Oh my dear right hand, I love you so!" except in dirty jokes!

Well...* '''Don't merge''': They are different things. It would be like merging ''fruit'' and ''apple''.This doesn't appear very active though, and considering it's been debated before, I don't think anybody should be merging this. Cheers, Rothery 08:57, 2 May 2007 (UTC):I agree, I think masturbation is a type of autoeroticism but it doesn't work the other way around. Yonatan talk 18:02, 16 July 2007 (UTC)Not quite a double negativeIntro, para 4, line 3: ''The potential for injury or even death that exists while engaging in the '''partnered''' versions of these fetishes (the erotic asphyxiation and bondage, respectively) becomes drastically '''increased''' due to the isolation and lack of assistance...." How does having a partner increase risk of "injury or even death"?  From all that I have read, quite the opposite is true: a partner will prevent injury if the play goes beyond the bounds of safety, and will prevent death if the play ''is'' injury. The linked ref (}does not point to anything specific so I cannot argue against it just on language.

After explaining that the Catholic Church believes masturbation to be immoral, it suddenly cuts to saying that women can masturbate using different means, and then the paragraph ends abruptly.
