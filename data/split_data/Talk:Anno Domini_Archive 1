eventually I'll get around to writing about why Bede and Charlemagne's court were probably also using A.D. to suppress certain apocalyptic worries inherent in the system of using dating since the creation of the world - they were creeping up on the year 6000....   Oh - and don't even get me started on when 'a' year begins. For the A.U.C. Roman system it starts on April 21, the anniversary of foundation.  Lately we've been starting years on January 1.    --MichaelTinkler----What does A.U.C. mean exactly? -rmhermen----Make sure you cross-reference and avoid duplicating the stuff in Calendar.  --LDC-----whoops!  Ab Urbe Condita, "from the foundation of the City" - will insert.Feel free to cross reference all you see fit - but erae and calendars are technically different.-----I know everyone says Anno Domini means "Year of Our Lord"; but literally speaking doesn't it just mean "Year of Lord"? The Latin phrase does not contain the word "our" anywhere in it.------no, it's just 'year of the Lord', literally, but the idiomatic usage is Our.  Oh, by the way, always feel free to add 'a' or 'the' when translating Latin.  Latin doesn't have an article at all. --MichaelTinkler
