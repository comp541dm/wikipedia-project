She was one of the best known sex symbols of the 1950s and 1960s and was widely referred to by her initials. Starting in 1969, Bardot became the official face of Marianne (who had previously been anonymous) to represent the liberty of France.Anne-Marie Sohn (teacher at the École Normale Supérieure|ENS-Lyon),  (résumé of Maurice Agulhon's three books, ''Marianne au combat'', ''Marianne au pouvoir'' and ''Les métamorphoses de Marianne'')Bardot was an aspiring ballerina in early life. She started her acting career in 1952 and after appearing in 16 routine comedy films, with limited international release, became world-famous in 1957, with the controversial film ''And God Created Woman''. She later starred in Jean-Luc Godard's 1963 film ''Contempt (film)|Le Mépris''. For her role in Louis Malle's 1965 film ''Viva Maria!'' Bardot was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress. Bardot caught the attention of French intellectuals. She was the subject of Simone de Beauvoir's 1959 essay, ''The Lolita Syndrome'', which described Bardot as a "locomotive of women's history" and built upon existentialist themes to declare her the first and most liberated woman of post-war France.guardotBardot retired from the entertainment industry in 1973. During her career in show business, she starred in 47 films, performed in several musical shows and recorded over 60 songs. She was awarded the Legion of Honour in 1985 but refused to receive it., independent.co.uk, 8 May 2008. After her retirement, she established herself as an animal rights activist. During the 1990s, she generated controversy by criticizing immigration and Islam in France and has been fined five times for inciting racial hatred.Early lifeBardot was born in Paris, the daughter of Louis Bardot (1896–1975) and Anne-Marie "Toty" Bardot (née Mucel; 1912–1978). Louis had an engineering degree and worked with his father, Charles Bardot, in the family business. Louis and Anne-Marie married in 1933. Bardot grew up in an upper middle-class Roman Catholic observant home. When she was seven she was admitted to the Cours Hattemer, a private school. She went to school three days a week, and otherwise studied at home. This gave time for lessons at Madame Bourget's dance studio three days a week.Brigitte's mother also enrolled Brigitte's younger sister, Marie-Jeanne (born 5 May 1938), in dance. Marie-Jeanne eventually gave up dancing lessons and did not tell her mother, whereas Brigitte concentrated on ballet. In 1947, Bardot was accepted to the Conservatoire de Paris. For three years she attended ballet classes by Russian choreographer Boris Knyazev. One of her classmates was Leslie Caron. The other ballerinas nicknamed Bardot "Bichette" ("Little Doe").Caron, Leslie. ''Thank Heaven'', Plume Publishing (2009);;At the invitation of an acquaintance of her mother, she modelled in a fashion show in 1949. In the same year, she modelled for a fashion magazine "''Jardin des Modes''" managed by journalist Hélène Lazareff. Aged 15, she appeared on an 8 March 1950 cover of ''Elle'' and was noticed by a young film director, Roger Vadim, while babysitting. He showed an issue of the magazine to director and screenwriter Marc Allégret, who offered Bardot the opportunity to audition for ''Les lauriers sont coupés''. Although Bardot got the role, the film was cancelled but made her consider becoming an actress. Her acquaintance with Vadim, who attended the audition, influenced her further life and career."InitialsBB""twolives"CareerAlthough the European film industry was then in its ascendancy, Bardot was one of the few European actresses to have the mass media's attention in the United States, an interest which she did not reciprocate. She debuted in a 1952 comedy film, ''Le Trou Normand'' (English title: ''Crazy for Love''). From 1952 to 1956, she appeared in seventeen films; in 1953 she played a role in Jean Anouilh's stageplay ''L'Invitation au Château'' (''Invitation to the Castle''). She received media attention when she attended the Cannes Film Festival in April 1953."twolives"File:Brigitte Bardot - 1965.jpg|thumb|left|Brigitte Bardot and the young Billy Mumy in ''Dear Brigitte,'' 1965.Her films of the early and mid 1950s were generally lightweight romantic dramas, some historical, in which she was cast as Ingenue (stock character)|ingénue or siren, often appearing nude or nearly so. She played bit parts in three English-language films, the British comedy ''Doctor at Sea'' (1955) with Dirk Bogarde, ''Helen of Troy'' (1954), in which she was understudy for the title role but appears only as Helen's handmaid and ''Act of Love'' (1954) with Kirk Douglas. Her French-language films were dubbed for international release. Roger Vadim (her husband) was not content with this light fare. The New Wave of French and Italian art directors and their stars were riding high internationally and he felt Bardot was being undersold. Looking for something more like an art film to push her as a serious actress, he showcased her in ''And God Created Woman'' (1956) opposite Jean-Louis Trintignant. The film, about an immoral teenager in a respectable small-town setting, was a huge success and turned Bardot into an international star."twolives"During her early career, professional photographer Sam Lévin's photos contributed to her image of Bardot's sensuality. One showed Bardot from behind, dressed in a white corset. British photographer Cornel Lucas made images of Bardot in the 1950s and 1960s, that have become representative of her public persona. Bardot in 1968.She divorced Vadim in 1957. In 1959, she married actor Jacques Charrier, with whom she starred in ''Babette Goes to War''. The press took great interest in her marriage, while she and her husband clashed over the direction of her career. Bardot's only child, Nicolas-Jacques Charrier, was a product of her marriage to Jacques Charrier.Bardot was awarded a David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign actress for her role in ''A Very Private Affair'' (''Vie privée'', 1962), directed by Louis Malle.[Awards for Brigitte Bardot info], IMDb.com; retrieved 21 August 2010In May 1958, Bardot withdrew to the seclusion of Southern France, where she had bought the house ''La Madrague'' in Saint-Tropez. In 1963, she starred in Jean-Luc Godard's film ''Contempt (film)|Le Mépris''. Bardot was featured in many other films along with notable actors such as Alain Delon (''Famous Love Affairs''; ''Spirits of the Dead''); Jean Gabin (''In Case of Adversity''); Sean Connery (''Shalako''); Jean Marais (''Royal Affairs in Versailles''; ''School for Love''); Lino Ventura (''Rum Runners''); Annie Girardot (''The Novices''); Claudia Cardinale (''The Legend of Frenchie King''); Jeanne Moreau (''Viva Maria!''); Jane Birkin (''Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman'').

Bardot pleaded with Gainsbourg not to release this duet and he complied with her wishes; the following year, he rerecorded a version with British-born model and actress Jane Birkin that became a massive hit all over Europe. The version with Bardot was issued in 1986 and became a popular download hit in 2006 when Universal Music made its back catalogue available to purchase online, with this version of the song ranking as the third most popular download.Personal lifeOn 21 December 1952, aged 18, Bardot married director Roger Vadim, seven years her senior. To receive permission from Bardot's parents to marry her, Vadim, originally a Russian Orthodox Christian, was urged to convert to Catholicism, although it is not clear if he ever did so. They divorced five years later, but remained friends and collaborated in later work.

In the letter, Bardot describes the activity as a "macabre spectacle" that "is a shame for Denmark and the Faroe Islands ...

Additionally, in a section in the book entitled, "Open Letter to My Lost France", Bardot writes that ''"my country, France, my homeland, my land is again invaded by an overpopulation of foreigners, especially Muslims"''. For this comment, a French court fined her 30,000 francs in June 2000. She had been fined in 1997 for the original publication of this open letter in ''Le Figaro'' and again in 1998 for making similar remarks.Image:BrigitteBardot.jpg|thumb|220px|Brigitte Bardot in Nice in 2002.In her 2003 book, ''Un cri dans le silence'' ("''A Scream in the Silence''"), she warned of an "Islamicization of France", and said of Muslim immigration:In the book, she contrasted her close gay friends with today's homosexuals, who "jiggle their bottoms, put their little fingers in the air and with their little castrato voices moan about what those ghastly heteros put them through" and that some contemporary homosexuals behave like "fairground freaks". In her own defence, Bardot wrote in a letter to a French gay magazine: "Apart from my husband — who maybe will cross over one day as well — I am entirely surrounded by homos. For years, they have been my support, my friends, my adopted children, my confidants."In her book she wrote about issues such as racial mixing, immigration, the role of women in politics and Islam. The book also contained a section attacking what she called the mixing of genes and praised previous generations who, she said, had given their lives to push out invaders.On 10 June 2004, Bardot was convicted for a fourth time by a French court for "inciting racial hatred" and fined €5,000. Bardot denied the racial hatred charge and apologized in court, saying: "I never knowingly wanted to hurt anybody. It is not in my character."In 2008, Bardot was convicted of inciting racial/religious hatred in relation to a letter she wrote, a copy of which she sent to Nicolas Sarkozy when he was Interior Minister of France. The letter stated her objections to Muslims in France ritually slaughtering sheep by slitting their throats without anesthetizing them first. She also said, in reference to Muslims, that she was "fed up with being under the thumb of this population which is destroying us, destroying our country and imposing its habits". The trial concluded on 3 June 2008, with a conviction and fine of €15,000, the largest of her fines to date.

Bardot popularized this style which is especially used for knitted sweaters or jumpers although it is also used for other tops and dresses. Bardot popularized the bikini in her early films such as ''Manina'' (1952) (released in France as ''Manina, la fille sans voiles''). The following year she was also photographed in a bikini on every beach in the south of France during the Cannes Film Festival. She gained additional attention when she filmed ''...And God Created Woman'' (1956) with Jean-Louis Trintignant (released in France as ''Et Dieu Créa La Femme''). Bardot portrayed an immoral teenager cavorting in a bikini who seduces men in a respectable small-town setting. The film was an international success."twolives"The bikini was in the 1950s relatively well accepted in France but was still considered risqué in the United States. As late as 1959, Anne Cole, one of the United State's largest swimsuit designers, said, "It's nothing more than a G-string. It's at the razor's edge of decency."She also brought into fashion the ''choucroute'' ("Sauerkraut") hairstyle (a sort of beehive hair style) and gingham clothes after wearing a checkered pink dress, designed by Jacques Esterel, at her wedding to Charrier. She was the subject for an Andy Warhol painting.Bardot's fashion in 1961.In addition to popularizing the bikini swimming suit, Bardot has been credited with popularizing the city of St. Tropez and the town of Armação dos Búzios in Brazil, which she visited in 1964 with her boyfriend at the time, Brazilian musician '''Bob Zagury'''.

Lennon and Bardot met in person once, in 1968 at the Mayfair Hotel, introduced by Beatles press agent Derek Taylor; a nervous Lennon took LSD before arriving, and neither star impressed the other. (Lennon recalled in a memoir, "I was on acid, and she was on her way out.") pg. 24 According to the liner notes of his first (self-titled) album, musician Bob Dylan dedicated the first song he ever wrote to Bardot. He also mentioned her by name in "I Shall Be Free", which appeared on his second album, ''The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan''.
