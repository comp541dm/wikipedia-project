Riding shotgun. The driver is holding the whip with the shotgun messenger on his left.'''Riding shotgun''' refers to the practice of sitting alongside the driver in a moving vehicle.The phrase has been used to mean giving actual or figurative support or aid to someone in a situation or project.EtymologyThe expression "riding shotgun"  is derived from "shotgun messenger", a colloquial term for "express messenger", in the days of stagecoach travel the person in the position next to the driver. However, apparently the phrase "riding shotgun" was not coined until 1919. It was later used in print and especially film depiction of stagecoaches and wagons in the Old West in danger of being robbed or attacked by bandits. A special armed employee of the express service using the stage for transportation of bullion or cash would sit beside the driver, carrying a short shotgun (or alternatively a rifle), to provide an armed response in case of threat to the cargo, which was usually a strongbox. Absence of an armed person in that position often signaled that the stage was not carrying a strongbox, but only passengers.Modern usageMore recently, the term has been applied to a game, usually played by groups of friends to determine who rides beside the driver in a car. Typically, this involves claiming the right to ride shotgun by being the first person to call out "shotgun".  While there are many other rules for the game, such as a requirement that the vehicle be in sight, nearly all players agree that the game may only begin on the way to the car. In addition, a number of humorous rules for calling shotgun has been developed by organizations and individuals (for example, the "survival of the fittest rule").*[Rules of shotgun], Shotgunrules.com,  Retrieved 27 March 2015.*[The Shotgun Rules, version 1.1] by the Airborne Early Warning Association,  Retrieved 27 March 2015.*'': The 25 Universal Rules of Order for Riding Shotgun'' By David A.
