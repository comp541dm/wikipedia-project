;;Metropolitan region vs. “Capital” regionPlease don’t confuse the Berlin metropolitan area as Wikipedia defines a Metropolitan area with the “Capital” region as some officials/agencies in Berlin-Brandenburg would like to define the region. According to Wikipedia: “A metropolitan area, metro area or metro is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing” – note that farming and other distant rural areas are not included. The metro area is shown for example as the yellow parts of the maps and by the lists of towns. Personally, I would also say it’s the area you can reach by public transport with a Berlin ABC ticket. The given reference also refers this as “Berliner Umland”.The “Capital Region Berlin-Brandenburg” is a construction that government agencies are trying to push, but it simply includes all of Brandenburg with Berlin. It is true, that in the wider sense Brandenburg’s economy is generally, but not exclusively, oriented towards Berlin. Some day they may even become politically united.  However, it is stretching it a bit far to say that vast rural areas such as the forests of the Uckermark or the swamps of the Spreewald belong to the metropolitan area of Berlin. It would be like saying all of Connecticut is part of the Hartford metropolitan area.So, please adhere to the definition set by Wikipedia and do not follow some megalomaniac political redefinition. Alandeus (talk) 13:35, 7 February 2013 (UTC):Hello :) It is not up to us or Wikipedia to define Berlin metropolitan, that is up to The state of Berlin and Brandenburg, or the German Federal State.  If the official numbers are 6 million then it is 6 million, we are not the judgers of that, we follow the official figures, and fact is that Berlin metropolitan are Berlin-Brandenburg. and the links clearly defines the Berlin-Brandenburg as Berlins metro area.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/86.52.81.168|86.52.81.168 (talk) 18:25, 7 February 2013 (UTC);; ;;::I’m sorry User 86.52.81.168, but in the encyclopedic realm of Wikipedia, its definitions are quite sound (see above). If some well-meaning government officials for the Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region have a different idea of what a metropolitan area is, they are welcome to espouse something else on their own “official” websites, no matter how off the mark they are. What they are actually advocating is simply a much larger regional area with a real metropolitan area in the middle as a focal point. The faraway fields of Brandenburg only belong to the Berlin area in so far as that is where the Berliners get their vegetables from for example or where they go for a weekend getaway. Greetings from Berlin, yours Alandeus (talk) 09:12, 8 February 2013 (UTC)Official definitions are all we need with reliable links, the figure of 4.5 mio people don't have any link, but the claims of 6 mio people does, so that is the guideline and what we can use as a reliable source.Wikipedia is not a place to make definitions, but a encyclopedia, to put reliable content. At least let's change the figure to include 6 mio people.But is must say that you don't recognize the official figures from the states of Berlin and Brandenburg plus IKM (Initiativkreises Europäische Metropolregionen in Deutschland) are not in the spirit if Wikipedia, where reliable sources are all we recognized. The German language site on Wikipedia Metropolregion Berlin/Brandenburg recognized the links, why not on the English language site?  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/86.52.81.168|86.52.81.168 (talk) 22:43, 8 February 2013 (UTC);; ;;Wikipedia is;/b; a place to make definitions. When reviewing Metropolitan Areas it must have a fundamental definition as a benchmark when collecting and comparing data from many different sources. Some “official” sites seem to make their area larger than what actual metropolitan are for whatever interests they may have. Sure, information from these sites is useful, but only insofar as it does not distort encyclopedic evaluation.About those 4.5 million inhabitants: The “Daten und Fakten zur Hauptstadtregion“ page (has those population figures in the middle and at the bottom of the page: about 3.5 for Berlin, 900 thousand for the area around Berlin (“Berliner Umland”) and 1.6 million for the rest of Brandenburg. I’m sure these latter, more distant Brandenburgers would be appalled to be considered being part of Berlin. Alandeus (talk) 10:01, 11 February 2013 (UTC)The same site say that "Berlin und Brandenburg bilden zusammen die deutsche Hauptstadtregion mit 6 million menschen" In English - "Berlin and Brandenburg together form the German capital region with 6 million people", fact.You write "more distant Brandenburgers would be appalled to be considered being part of Berlin" Personal feelings are not relevant, the States of Berlin and Brandenburg say it is Berlin metro area, then it is what it is, fact.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/86.52.84.231|86.52.84.231 (talk) 18:13, 11 February 2013 (UTC);; ;;:Dear 86.52.84.231: Back to basics once more: The quoted source says “Hauptstadtregion” or “capital region”. Granted, that is the whole region around the capital including all of rural Brandenburg. When Wikipedia talks about metropolitan areas, however, that is a concentration on exclusively urban areas and that is what we ought to stick to when evaluating the Berlin metro area, including the 4½ population figure. My opinion on the Brandenburgers, by the way, was not meant to be taken as a fact of course; it was just a tongue-in-the-cheek afterthought. Alandeus (talk) 07:50, 12 February 2013 (UTC)Hello Alandeus :) my point is that the only figures we have are the 6 million people, no source are mentioning 4½.And recarding metropolitan areas, a metro area are not only urban, but can contain large rural areas who are afffected by the urban area in terms of commuting and influence..As stated in Wikipedia's own site - A metropolitan area combines an urban agglomeration (the contiguous, built-up area) with zones not necessarily urban in character, but closely bound to the center by employment or other commerce. These outlying zones are sometimes known as a commuter belt, and may extend well beyond the urban zone.Metro areas with large rural areas are common, here are some.Seattle metropolitan area 3.5 mio people - 21,202 km2Phoenix metropolitan area 4.2 mio people - 37,744 km2Hamburg Metropolitan Region 5.2 mio people - 26,000 km2.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/86.52.84.231|86.52.84.231 (talk) 12:07, 12 February 2013 (UTC);; ;;:The quaint Brandenburg towns of Wusterhausen, Schwedt and Lübbenau for example are each about an hour’s drive from Berlin and are therefore not really in the defined ‘commuter belt’ of or otherwise ‘closely bound’ in a Berlin metro area, i.e. that yellow area on the metro area map. And although that 4½ million figure is not mentioned explicitly on the aforementioned source page, it is pretty easy to come to this total from the data provided there.  And those other examples; maybe those need to be reexamined as well. Alandeus (talk) 14:24, 12 February 2013 (UTC)The map you are mentioning are self made by a wikipedia user called Broadway, so the definitions on that map are not any official status.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/86.52.84.231|86.52.84.231 (talk) 19:07, 12 February 2013 (UTC);; ;;:Of course Broadway’s excellent map of the Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region is not “official”. It visualises perfectly well though the area as correctly defined by the rest of the Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region article. Please, 86.52.84.231 (are you from Berlin or Brandenburg?), get off the idea that everything must have or rely only on an official source. Alandeus (talk) 09:50, 13 February 2013 (UTC)It seems that we are not going anywhere :) lets at least mentioning the 6 mio, when the official sources claims it.  What about this line, "the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, whit a population ranging from 4,5 to 6 mio people according to different sources.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/86.52.84.231|86.52.84.231 (talk) 22:19, 13 February 2013 (UTC);; ;;:No need to muddle up or bloat the lead paragraph with references to differing sources. Various population figures can already be found in the Demographics section. For the sake of completeness though, I’ve added “The entire Berlin-Brandenburg region has a population then of 6 million.” there with reference to . Hope this is a satisfactory compromise. Alandeus (talk) 09:04, 14 February 2013 (UTC)West BerlinWest Berlin was not legally part of West Germany and to state that it was compromises the factual accuracy of this article. Paul Austin (talk) 13:44, 29 April 2013 (UTC):Although the Allies maintained their role as the highest executive authority - West Berlin did ''de facto'' become a "Bundesland" of the FRG, and was represented in the Bundestag and Bundesrat. West Berlins' residents were citizens of the FRG. There is no need to go into depth about West Berlins' complicated legal status - at least not in the lead.

In the 1980s I actually believed that to be the be the case.  I know that Willi Brandt, who resided in West Berlin, served as chancellor of the Federal Republic before the re-unification.  However, I also know that West Germany's laws allowed even citizens of East Germany to hold that office and others in West Germany, since they refused to recognize any distinction between different German citizenships.  I think it was from reading Wikipedia's article on Germany's re-unification and its article on the Federal Republic that I came to think that Berlin was never incorporated in the Federal Republic until 1990.  Is there a source for the assertion? Michael Hardy (talk) 11:49, 1 August 2013 (UTC):West Berlin did de facto become a "Bundesland" of the FRG, and was represented in the Bundestag and Bundesrat.

The prefix ''bundes-'' does generally mean "federal", but in English the term "federal state" is often taken to mean a federated state, like the U.S.A. or like Germany or Brazil or any of various others (Switzerland, Canada, Australia, Mexico,....), i.e. a state composed of a union of smaller states.:But a difficulty arises: I don't know if the English language has any good term that refers to the concept that ''Bundesland'' refers to.  It would be a common noun whose referents include things like Schleswig-Holstein, Wisconsin, and Alagoas.:Is there some reasonable term that could be used here instead of the misleading term "federal state"? Michael Hardy (talk) 17:41, 5 August 2013 (UTC):I believe just "state" would be fine to use. "Federal state" is not correct for Berlin, or for West Berlin like in the quote. Actually West Berlin was not even a proper state, more something of a de facto-state tightly connected to West Germany. --JohanahoJ (talk) 18:39, 5 August 2013 (UTC)Name of Berlin / EtymologyThe Etymology section should be redone, according to that of the German article.

The "berlin style" of Döner kebab sandwich, not surprisingly, developed in Berlin, through the 70s and 80s. But the legend that the Döner was "invented" there is highly misleading. The Döner meat itself has been served in Turkey for more than a century, and Döner sandwiches as snack or street food have been sold in Turkey since at least the 1950s.
