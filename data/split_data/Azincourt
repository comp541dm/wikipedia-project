According to M. Forrest, the French knights were so encumbered by their armour that they were exhausted even before the start of the battle.The House of Commons: 1509 – 1558, Volume 4; Stanley T.

Hasler (Boydell ; Brewer, 1982)Later on, when he became king in 1509, Henry VIII is supposed to have commissioned an English translation of a Life of Henry VHenry VIII;J. J. Scarisbrick, p. 23 so that he could emulate him, on the grounds that he thought that launching a campaign against France would help him to impose himself on the European stage. In 1513, Henry VIII conclusively crossed the English Channel and stopped at Azincourt. He was notably accompanied by John Nevill.leftThe battle, as was the tradition, was named after a nearby castle called Azincourt. The castle has since disappeared and the settlement now known as Azincourt adopted the name in the 17th Century.PopulationSightsThe original battlefield museum in the village featured model knights made out of Action Man figures. However, this has now been replaced by the Centre Historique Medieval (CHM) a more professional museum, conference centre and exhibition space incorporating laser, video, slide shows, audio commentaries, and some interactive elements. The museum building is shaped like a longbow similar to those used at the battle by archers under King Henry.Since 2004 a large medieval festival organised by the local community, the CHM, The Azincourt Alliance, and various other UK societies commemorating the battle, local history and medieval life, arts and crafts has been held in the village, on a July. Prior to this date the festival was held in October, but due to the inclement weather and local heavy clay soil (like the battle) making the festival difficult it was moved to July. No festival will be held in 2014, with a number of events planned for 2015 on the 600th anniversary of the original battle.Commemorative monument near to the battlefieldInternational relationsList of twin towns and sister cities in FranceTwin towns – Sister citiesAzincourt is twinned with:*UK Middleham, United KingdomSee also* Communes of the Pas-de-Calais department* Agincourt, Ontario, Canada named for Azincourt, not Agincourt, Meurthe-et-MoselleReferencesExternal linksAzincourt
