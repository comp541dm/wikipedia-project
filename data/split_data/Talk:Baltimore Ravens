Marching BandI ask to all that we add to this to the page, speaking of the story of the Baltimore Marching Colts, that would become the Marching Ravens.. I will add to it and would appreciate assistance in this!! :)  This is the NFL's only current, Official Marching Band.Addition:  THey have everything on this page : However.., I think we should link/ mention them in this article!!Source: --Tigerhawk47 (talk) 15:57, 14 January 2011 (UTC)UntitledI don't agree with the shift of Cleveland Browns content to the Cleveland Browns page.  The old Browns and current Ravens are linearly the same franchise, with the same owner and carrying over much of the same management structure and player personnel.  The new Browns are an expansion team with new owners and personnel.  As is correctly pointed out, the current franchise owns the old trademarks and stuff, but that's not relevant; it's like saying that Michael Jackson was a Beatle because he now owns the rights to the old Lennon-McCartney songs.Willing to be persuaded; otherwise, would recommend switching it back.  -- RjLeschI am inclined to agree.  While it is true that the NFL decided to transfer the teams history, the fact remains that the Baltimore Ravens were not an expansion team.  They had the same players, coaches, and management as the old Browns, and it is they new Browns that are the true expansion team. Jeff8765 15:42, Jan 24, 2005 (UTC)*But currently, the NFL and all its official records technically treats the Baltimore Ravens as an 1996 '''expansion team''' who just got same players, coaches, and management as the old Browns. The Browns are treated like the team '''suspended operations''' from 1996-1998. Zzyzx11 (Talk) 05:40, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)::Zzyzx11 is correct, and the wish among Baltimore fans is to use that same treatment to make the Colts in Baltimore the Baltimore predessesor team, with a suspended operations until the Ravens came along.  --Noitall 23:31, August 10, 2005 (UTC):::I doubt that will happen in the near future, as the Irsay family seems persistent in keeping all of the Baltimore Colts history and records. Until then, the Colts and the Ravens are officially different and separate teams. Zzyzx11 (Talk) 18:05, 20 August 2005 (UTC)Several issues: It is only part Irsay, the rest in Tagliabou.  The Colts are the one exception and have been treated that way from the beginning.  In fact, the city of Baltimore was initiating eminant domain procedings when the Colts left (it may have hastened their departure).  It is a legal argument that would likely work, but is likely not to be needed any more.'''This is not the "NFL" page.  The city of Baltimore and all those hall of famers, uncluding Johnnie U., have every right to assert their position that Baltimore NFL history includes the Colts.  NPOV means they get equal treatment'''.Finally, the legacy of 2 previous Baltimore Colts teams was OFFICIALLY incorporated with great fanfare into the Baltimore Ravens, see brief description at Baltimore Colts (1947-50).  This is the only football team to have such a legacy and history. --Noitall 03:16, August 29, 2005 (UTC)*All I am going to by the official history of the NFL.

Zzyzx11 (Talk) 03:47, 29 August 2005 (UTC)::I have no problem with your compromise edit. For the most part, I don't mind further explanations as long as the position of some (very passionate) fans and hall of famers is in there.  I became rather annoyed because I thought I already took some time to make compromise edits and, well, you know the rest. --Noitall 03:52, August 29, 2005 (UTC)I would like to see this become the standard for relocating sports franchises.  When a team abandons a city, they should leave the history behind.  It's ridiculous that Baltimore couldn't call their CFL team the Colts because the team that fled to Indianapolis held the rights to the name.  Phoenix has no business trading on the Chicago Cardinals history, and so on.  The city of Washington should have been allowed to call the transplanted Montreal Expos the Senators if the fans wanted to do so, without requiring permission from the Texas Rangers.Whatever the legal issues, public pressure can enforce this.However, we are recording history here, and the details behind the Cleveland-Baltimore shuffle should be documented.WHPratt (talk) 02:12, 11 February 2009 (UTC)WHPrattIf the Sony Records declared Journey's curent lead singer Arnel Pineda would for now on legally named Steve Perry and get all Steve Perry gold recoeds and the original Steve Perry would for now on be called Joe Smith. Would that make Arnel Pineda Steve Perry?DLA75 (talk) 02:39, 29 September 2009 (UTC):No. But on the other hand, if the owner of the historic Brown Widget Company in Cleveland wanted to move his business, and the city sued to stop him, they could agree out of court that he could hire the workers and move to Baltimore to set up a new Ravens Widget Company. Meanwhile, the historic Brown Widget Company would cease its business operations for three years while it gets approval to obtain a new owner, new workers, and the proper business licenses to open again.

They were the third team with a title of 'Wild Card' to win the big game ('80 Raiders and '97 Broncos the first two), but the '69 Kansas City Chiefs won Super Bowl IV after finishing second in their division, making the Ravens the fourth non-division winning world champion.

The people who look at this page are Baltimore Colts and Baltimore Ravens fans.  There is no such thing as a "Colts" fan.  A fan is either a fan of the Baltimore Colts or the Indianapolis Colts.  On December 28, 2008, it was Baltimore that hosted the Official NFL Celebration of the "Greatest Game Every Played" which was won by Baltimore.  Therefore, since the players and fans who made the Baltimore Colts an institution feel that the Baltimore Ravens are the direct successors to the Baltimore Colts this should be accurately reflected in Wikipedia.  Each Hall of Fame Baltimore Colt is honored in Baltimore at the Ravens stadium and not in Indiana.  Logic would dictate that the gatekeepers of this page allow direct links from the Baltimore Ravens to the Baltimore Colts on this entry.  If not, then a Baltimore NFL page needs to be created.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/97.11.196.52|97.11.196.52 (talk) 17:30, 30 December 2008 (UTC);; ;;2010 O.T.AWith a productive off-season now over the Ravens have changed what was once considered a weakness into a strength at the wide receiver position. According to John Eisenberg "It was such a positive off-season that the Ravens are going to be a popular pick to win the AFC North". But with progress there is also concern, All-Pro safety Ed Reed has declared a 50-50 chance of return for the 2010 season, it is no doubt that without the experienced veteran the Ravens will surly be at a disadvantage vs other team's passing game. With the new found teaching method of head coach John Harbaugh (whole-part-whole) contributing Writer Ryan Mink felt The success of the Raven's organized team activities was not by coincidence.Ish kay (talk) 02:47, 16 June 2010 (UTC)kay (talk) 02:47, 16 June 2010 (UTC)Wild Card vs. Non Divison champThe current version of the article contains the following line::''The Ravens became only the third wild card team (and fourth non-division champion) to win a Super Bowl championship.''I'm unsure how a team could win a Super Bowl being neither a division champ nor a wild card.

HuskyHuskie (talk) 23:31, 15 January 2012 (UTC):They may have been thinking of the 1969 Kansas City Chiefs, who finished second in their division but ended up as AFL champions due to a one-year-only crossover playoff system.

The Steelers and Patriots are rivals with the Ravens because of frequency of meetings, how important the meetings are in the regular season and the playoffs, how close the games are, etc. The Colts and Browns are rivals with the Ravens because of the history of teams changing between cities. But to suggest some are true "rivalries" just because of a couple of close games doesn't seem to honor how significant rivals are (Titans, Jaguars, Jets.) There are 15 teams other than the Ravens in the AFC and 8 of those 15 are listed as "rivals" along with 1 team from the NFC. While I am not doubting there are good reasons many of these teams have grudges with with the Ravens and vice versa, I think it is a bit of a stretch suggesting all of them are true rivalries.Furthermore, the Jets, Titans, and Jaguars articles do not list the Ravens as a rival (nor do the Redskins or Colts, though those seem much more plausible given the geography and history, respectively.) The Steelers, Patriots, Browns, and Bengals do list the Ravens as rivals in their respective articles.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Pittsburgher1987 (talk • Special:Contributions/Pittsburgher1987|contribs) 04:32, 21 January 2013 (UTC);;; ;;Bjking1003 (talk) 23:21, 3 February 2013 (UTC)fan graffititook out the stupid RAVENS 2013 SUPERBOWL CHAMPIONS someone had addedi know your happy (as a fan so am i) ...but christEDIT i have replaced it with something a LITTLE more suitableTony Spike (talk) 03:55, 4 February 2013 (UTC):Tony Spike, based on , I can assure you that Wikipedia would not agree with your definition of "suitable".
