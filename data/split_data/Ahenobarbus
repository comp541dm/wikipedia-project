'''Ahenobarbus''' was a ''cognomen'' used by a plebeian branch of the ''gens Domitia'' in the late Roman Republic and early Empire.  The name means "red-beard" (literally, "bronze-beard") in Latin. According to legend, Castor and Pollux announced to one of their ancestors the victory of the Romans over the Latins at the battle of Lake Regillus, and, to confirm the truth of what they had just said, they stroked his black hair and beard, which immediately became red.Suetonius, ''Nero'' 1Plutarch, ''Aemil.'' 25Dionysius of Halicarnassus, vi. 13Tertullian, ''Apol.'' 22List of AhenobarbiNotable Ahenobarbi include:* Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 192 BC)* Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 162 BC)* Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 122 BC)* Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 96 BC), son of the same named consul of 122 BC.* Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 94 BC)* Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (died 81 BC)* Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 54 BC), son of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 96 BC), supporter of Pompey and character in Lucan's ''Pharsalia''* Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (praetor 50 BC)* Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32 BC).
