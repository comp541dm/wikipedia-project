Ablative armorThe '''ablative case''' (abbreviated '''abl''') is a grammatical case in the grammar of various languages; it is used generally to express motion away from something although the precise meaning may vary by language. The word "ablative" derives from the Latin ''ablatus'', the (irregular) perfect passive participle of ''auferre'' "to carry away".[The Ablative] , The Latin Library, accessed 06-01-14 There is no ablative case in modern Germanic languages such as English.Indo-European languagesLatinAblative (Latin)The ablative case in Latin (''[casus] ablativus'') has various uses, including following various prepositions, in an ablative absolute clause, and adverbially. The ablative case was derived from three Proto-Indo-European cases: ablative (from), instrumental (with), and locative (in/at).GreekIn Ancient Greek, there was no ablative case; some of its functions were taken by the genitive and others by the dative; the genitive had functions belonging to the Proto-Indo-European genitive and ablative cases.Herbert Weir Smyth. ''Greek Grammar''. par. 1279: composite or mixed cases. The genitive case with the prepositions ἀπό ''apó'' "away from" and ἐκ/ἐξ ''ek/ex'' "out of" is an example.GermanGerman does not have an ablative case in native words, but Latin ablative case-forms were used from the 17th till 19th century after some prepositions, for example after ''von'' in ''von dem Nomine'' (ablative of the Latin loanword ''Nomen''). Grammarians in that time, like Justus Georg Schottel, Kaspar von Stieler ("der Spate"), Johann Balthasar von Antesperg and Johann Christoph Gottsched, listed an ablative case (as the sixth case after nominative, genitive, dative, accusative and vocative) for German words. They considered the dative case after some prepositions to be an ablative, as in ''von dem Mann[e]'' ("from the man" or "of the man") and ''mit dem Mann[e]'' ("with the man"), while they considered the dative case after other prepositions or without a preposition as ''dem Mann[e]'' to be a dative.Bosnian, Croatian and SerbianLike in Ancient Greek the functions of the ablative case in Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian are performed by the genitive case. Of the thhree forms of genitive in Serbian, as well in Croatian and Bosnian (partitive, possessive and ablative), the noun in the ablative genitive marks the origin of something: departure or detachment from it.AlbanianThe ablative case is found in Albanian; it is the fifth case, ''rasa rjedhore''.SanskritIn Sanskrit, the ablative case is the fifth case (''pañcamī'') and has a similar function to that of Latin. It is bound up with a special semantic condition, ''apādāna'' (अपादान) in Sanskrit. In fact, the fifth case (ablative) is the typical morphological realization of ''apādāna'' (Pāṇini 2.3.28).Sanskrit nouns in this case often refer to a subject "out of" which or "from" whom something (an action, an object) has arisen or occurred: ''patram '''vṛkṣāt''' patati'' "the leaf falls '''from the tree'''".It is also used for nouns in several other senses, as for actions occurring "because of" or "without" a certain noun, indicating distance or direction. When it appears with a comparative adjective, (''śreṣṭhatamam,'' "the best''), the ablative is used to refer to what the adjective is comparing: "better than X".ArmenianThe modern Armenian ablative has different markers for each main dialect, both originating from Classical Armenian. The Western Armenian affix -է ''-ē'' (definite -էն ''-ēn'') derives from the classical singular; the Eastern Armenian affix -ից ''-ic’'' (both indefinite and definite) derives from the classical plural. For both dialects, those affixex are singular, with the corresponding plurals being -(ն)երէ(ն) and -(ն)երից.{| class="wikitable" style="width: 75%"|-! Western !!

It is an outer locative case, used like the adessive and allative cases, to denote both being on top of something and "being around the place" (as opposed to the inner locative case, the elative, which means "from out of" or "from the inside of"). With the locative, the receding object was near the other place or object, not inside it.The Finnish ablative is also used in time expressions to indicate start times (''kymmeneltä'' "at ten") as well as with verbs expressing feelings or emotions.The Finnish ablative has the ending ''-lta'' or ''-ltä'', depending on vowel harmony.Usage; away from a place:*''katolta'': off the roof*''pöydältä'': off the table*''rannalta'': from the beach*''maalta'': from the land*''mereltä'': from the sea; with the verb ''lähteä'' (stop):*''lähteä tupakalta'': stop smoking (in the sense of putting out the cigarette one is smoking now, lit. 'leave from the tobacco')*''lähteä hippasilta'': stop playing tag (''hippa''=tag, ''olla hippasilla''=playing tag); to smell/taste/feel/look/sound like something:*''haisee pahalta'': smells bad*''maistuu hyvältä'': tastes good*''tuntuu kamalalta'': feels awful*''näyttää tyhmältä'': looks stupid*''kuulostaa mukavalta'': sounds niceHungarianThe ablative case in Hungarian is used to describe movement away from a solid object. For example, one walking away from a friend could say ''a barátom'''tól''' jövök'': I am coming (away from) my friend.Use of the case implies movement from ''next to'' the solid object and not from inside it. Thus, ''a postától jövök'' would mean one had been standing ''next to'' the post office, not inside the building.The application of vowel harmony gives two different suffixes: ''-tól'' and ''-től''. These are applied to back-vowel and front-vowel words, respectively.In contrast, the cases used to express movement towards a solid object and for being next to that solid object are the allative case and the adessive case respectively. The cases for movement away from, or out of, something are the delative case (for movement from a surface or from a Hungarian city) and the elative case (for movement out of a container or from out of a foreign city).", Hungarian Reference,1 June 2014Turkic languagesAzeriThe ablative in Azeri ('''') is expressed through the suffixes ''-dan'' or ''-dən'':Ev - ev'''dən'''''House - from/off the house''Aparmaq - aparmaq'''dan'''''To carry - from/off carrying''TurkishThe ablative in Turkish (''-den hali'' or ''uzaklaşma hali'') is expressed through the suffixes ''-den'', ''-dan'', ''-ten'' or ''-tan'':Ev - ev'''den'''''House - from/off the house''At - at'''tan'''''Horse - from/off the horse''Taşımak - taşımak'''tan'''''To carry - from/off carrying''Ses - ses'''ten'''''Sound/volume - from/off sound/volume''In some situations simple ablative can have a ”because of” meaning, in these situations ablative can be optionally followed by ”dolayı” (because of) preposition.Yüksek sesten (dolayı) rahatsız oldum. /  ''I was uneasy because of high volume.
