Question:s = (2/T) * ((1 - z) / (1 + z))I take it that ''z'' is the "transfer function in the analog domain"? What is ''T''? Is ''z'' a complex function? ''s'' is the transformed transfer function? What are the arguments of these functions? --AxelBoldtDo the changes answer your questions? -- ApYes, it is a lot clearer (I made some cosmetic changes now that I understand what is going on). Articles about "stable filter" and "transfer function" would really be useful for context, though. --AxelBoldtFormulaWhat is the correct formula for this transform? The current formula does not seem to agree with the "Background" paragraph.--AxelBoldtI found two essentially equivalent definitions:: s = (2/T) * ((1 - z-1) / (1 + z-1))and: s = (2/T) * ((z - 1) / (z + 1)).The first one is from ''Feedback control of dynamic systems'' by Franklin et al.  The second is from the help text of the bilinear operation in [Octave].What exactly do you mean by ''does not seem to agree''?-- ApIn the Background paragraph of the main article, it is explained that the transform maps complex numbers from the interior of the unit circle to the negative half plane. But I think the above transform maps complex numbers from the interior of the unit circle to the positive half plane. Or am I confused? --AxelBoldtOops, yes I am confused indeed. The above is correct, and gives values in the negative half plane. --AxelBoldt:True, both equations are the same, but I find it easier to convert the first form (above) into executable code. The second one requires a little algebra to make it useful in the real world, IMHO. Am I wrong? Madhu 23:57, 4 July 2006 (UTC)----Multiply the first equation by \frac{z}{z} and you get the second equation.  They are the same.Cburnett 05:31, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)"When the Laplace transform of a discrete-time signal with each element of the discrete-time sequence attached to an appropriately delayed unit impulse, the result is precisely the Z transform of the discrete-time sequence with the substitution......"-There is something wrong grammatically here. Is there a verb missing?:: "is" is the verb ("the result" is the subject), but it '''is''' poorly worded.  for some reason i think it's my fault. i'll work on fixing it. r b-j 23:59, 8 December 2005 (UTC)I understand how your first approximation z=((1+sT/2)/(1-sT/2) arises and leads to the bilinear transform, but the infinite series you show for ln(z) really puzzles me.  I can't concieve of any Taylor series expansion to produce it.  Can you shed some light on where it comes from?  Thanks.

Oli Filth 12:54, 15 April 2007 (UTC)Shouldn't there be a short definition for T somewhere, perhaps a link to ? It took me an extremely long time to understand this page because I had assumed that T stood for the sampling frequency, not the sampling period (reciprocal of sampling frequency). DavidCreswick 05:32, 20 October 2007 (UTC):T is already defined in the article as the sample time.  Oli Filth(talk) 11:56, 20 October 2007 (UTC)This article should be linked withQuestionIn the Frequency wrapping section, the T is left out in the formula's (i.e. exp(jwT)-; exp(jw)), is that ok??Arthurdenhaan (talk) 13:55, 1 November 2011 (UTC)--; I think so. the 'T' should be inserted at appropriate locationsin sentences and equation images. So, I corrected them.â€” Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/128.39.12.150|128.39.12.150 (talk) 12:03, 27 June 2011 (UTC);; ;;
