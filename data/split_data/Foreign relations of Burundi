Burundi's relations with its neighbours have often been affected by security concerns. Hundreds of thousands of Burundian refugees have at various times crossed to neighboring Rwanda, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Hundreds of thousands of Burundians are in neighboring countries as a result of the ongoing civil war. Most of them, more than 340,000 since 1993, are in Tanzania. Some Burundian rebel groups have used neighboring countries as bases for insurgent activities. The 1993 embargo placed on Burundi by regional states hurt diplomatic relations with its neighbors; relations have improved since the 1999 suspension of these sanctions.Burundi is a member of various international and regional organizations, including the United Nations, the African Union, the African Development Bank and the Francophonie. Burundi is also a member of the International Criminal Court with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the US-military (as covered under Article 98). The Swedish Minister for Integration and Gender Equality, Nyamko Sabuni, was born in Burundi.Bilateral relationsBelgium* Belgium has an embassy in Bujumbura.[Embassy of Belgium in Bujumbura (in Dutch and French)]* Burundi has an embassy in Brussels.[Embassy of Burundi in Brussels (in French)]Kenya* Kenya has an embassy in Bujumbura.[Embassy of Kenya in Bujumbura]* Burundi has an embassy in Nairobi.RwandaBurundi and Rwanda dispute sections of border on the Akanyaru and the Kagera/Nyabarongo rivers, which have changed course since the 1960s, when the boundary was delimited; cross-border conflicts among Tutsi, Hutu, other ethnic groups, associated political rebels, armed gangs, and various government forces persist in the Great Lakes region.South KoreaForeign relations of the Republic of KoreaEstablishment of Diplomatic Relations between South Korea and the Republic of Burundi was on 3 October 1993.
