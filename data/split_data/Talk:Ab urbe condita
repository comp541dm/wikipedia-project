UntitledError in: "Livy (I, 60) gives almost the same, 240 years for that interval". Livy gives 244 yearsWell, A.U.C. continued in common use despite Divus Julius - Livy, for instance, used it.  The Roman calendar article, which I linked, is a different issue from the year-count, but it's relevant, I guess. --MichaelTinklerEutropius and other authors also used ab urbe condita in their works. True, naming the years of the consuls was much more common, it is inaccurate to say that auc was only a modern reckoning. Chris Weimer 07:25, 3 February 2006 (UTC)Shouldn't 2006 be MMDCCLVIII to account for the fact that there was no year 0? That is, the calculation should be 2006 + 753 - 1, no? Iridius 02:19, 30 October 2006 (UTC):No. No year zero requires 2006 + 753 = 2759. The year before AD 1 is 1 BC and progresses backward to 753 BC. Invert this number sequence so that 1 is at 753 BC and 753 is at 1 BC. Then the years AD progress from 1 to 2006. The two number sequences are added by 753 + 2006. If there was a year zero between BC and AD, then the sequences would be 753 + 1 + 2006. Be that as it may, because the article gives two possible years for the founding of Rome, 753 BC and 745 BC, no modern conversion should be given, especially not in the section arguing that it was founded in 745 BC, so I removed it. — Joe Kress 06:01, 1 November 2006 (UTC)Why does it say after Christ (AD), in the dating?

Foogus (talk) 21:32, 6 April 2009 (UTC)Years Before the founding of RomeHow would years before the founding of Rome under the AUC system be recorded as? For example, under the BC-AD system of tracking years, anything that occured before the birth of Christ (or then at least what Dionysius Exiguus believed to be his birth date (1 AD) at the time it was created) is recorded as BC, any thing after his birth as AD. Under the AUC system, how would events such as the Trojan War, the voyage of Aeneas following the war, and other events preceding the founding of Rome be recorded as? I think this is something that should be addressed in this article which, as of 6/4/09, nothing has been stated regarding this.

Why not even a gerund: ''ab condendo urbis'' ? --Special:Contributions/209.201.114.50|209.201.114.50 (talk) 02:30, 25 August 2010 (UTC):Latin just works that way. Literally it means 'from the founded city (onwards)'. It has to be in a past tense to refer to the right time. The gerundive refers to the future, so ''ab urbe condenda'' would imply 'after the city will be built'. I suppose the gerund would work, but adjectival phrases are much more common in Latin. It is a bit similar to ''summus mons'' meaning 'the top of the mountain' instead of just 'the highest mountain'. –Radulfr (talk) 22:40, 17 January 2011 (UTC)BC/AD vs. BCE/CEI do understand that the BC/AD distinction is necessary to make, but I feel it would be better to actually use (or at least indicate) the BCE/CE pair instead.

(I say "in its traditional form" because astronomical calendars do have a Year 0, and presumably this too would apply to Ab Urbe Condita as well as Anno Domini.) This places the same year in AUC ''1 year behind'' what one would calculate simply by adding 753 to the year in AD. Correct conversion formula: AUC=AD+753''-1''--;AUC=AD+752. The Mysterious El Willstro (talk) 02:58, 21 January 2011 (UTC):Whether or not a year zero is placed before year one AUC will have no affect on any later year. It will only affect years ''before'' the AUC epoch, that is, before 753 BC, long before any AD year. The same thing happens when astronomical year numbering is used. Although that system has a year zero immediately before its year one, all positive astronomical years have the same AD number, so AD 2011 is +2011. Only the numbers assigned to BC years (before any year zero) are affected, thus Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC, which is −43 using astronomical year numbering.:AUC years come in many forms, including the official list by the Roman Emporer Augustus, that by Varro, and that by Livy (see Fasti#The Roman official chronicles). Furthermore, many modern editors "correct" the AUC numbers they find in ancient lists to fit their own ideas. So no single correspondence between AUC years and BC/AD years exists. AUC years are meaningless unless historical events are listed for at least some of them. These events include naming the consuls who held office each year, which was the dominant method of identifying years used by Roman historians, such as Suetonius in ''The Twelve Caesars''. Furthermore, AD years were invented by Dionysius Exiguus long after AUC years ceased to be used. Dionysius stated that Probus Junior was consul during the year he identified as AD 525, but did not mention any AUC year. Thus a thousand year long list of Roman consuls must be used to correlate AUC years with AD years. Unfortunately, no two consular lists agree. Thus we must rely on modern scholars to construct a modern list which at least minimizes the disagreements between ancient lists of historical events and their corresponding AUC years, BC/AD years, and consular years. — Joe Kress (talk) 05:01, 22 January 2011 (UTC)::I may have cited the wrong reason, but the difference between astronomical and traditional dating is really not the point. According to what I learned in Latin 222, the formula based on the City of Rome having been founded in 753 BC traditional (752 BC astronomical) is AUC=AD+752. One of our assignments was to construct a calendar each month in Latin using Kalends, Nones, and Ides alongside the regular ordinal numbers of days. We received bonus points for listing the then-current year Ab Urbe Condita in addition to the year Anno Domini. I took that class Anno Domini 2010, which was Ab Urbe Condita 2762.::So, if Anno Domini 2010 was Ab Urbe Condita 2762, the current year Anno Domini 2011 is Ab Urbe Condita 2763.

First year, second year, etc. In English we should say or write 1st year, 2nd year, etc. when using numerals, although most people neglect this. Anyhow, it's adjective before the noun in English, and I'm fairly certain that in Latin it works the same way with ordinal numbers, i.e. number first, then the noun it modifies. But it doesn't work this way with all adjectives, and if I'm not mistaken there is yet another rule depending upon whether or not the phrase appears in a sentence. Still, I suspect that in Latin, it's number first, then the noun it modifies.

What is anno urbis conditae?'''ab urbe condita:''' Suppose that this year is 1 AUC (''ab urbe condita''). It's one year from the founding of the city. In other words, this is the year that follows the year during which the city was founded, no? So what year was the year of the founding of the city? If the calendar has no year zero, then that year was -1 AUC (''ab urbe condita'').'''anno urbis conditae:''' Suppose instead that this year is 1 AUC (''anno urbis conditae''). Is it the year of the founding of the city? If so, then what was the prior year, a year prior to the year of the founding of the city? If the calendar has no year zero, then that year was -1 AUC (''anno urbis conditae'').According to these meanings of the two phrases, -1 ''ab urbe condita'' was 1 ''anno urbis conditae''. Likewise, 1 ''ab urbe condita'' was 2 ''anno urbis conditae''. Now, which of the years, -1 ''ab urbe condita'' or -1 ''anno urbis conditae'', is 753 BC? It cannot be both, though I won't argue for one or the other here. (Really, now. The arithmetic is fairly simple.) However, as I recall, the word ''conditae'' is, in part, an interesting play on words, not that this should have anything to do with our choice of which phrase, ''ab urbe condita'' or ''anno urbis conditae'', we prefer when using the abbreviation AUC. After all, the root of ''condita'' is present in both phrases.— Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/50.194.104.82|50.194.104.82 (talk) 23:50, 18 October 2012 (UTC);; ;;Special:Contributions/50.194.104.82|50.194.104.82 (talk) 23:57, 18 October 2012 (UTC):Replying to a very old post here, but the year 1 ''ab urbe condita'' is the year Rome was founded. When counting intervals, the people of that time included both the start point and the end point. Similarly, Jesus was said to have resurrected on the third day after his death. He died on Long Friday, and rose on Sunday, which to them was the third day. It's also the same with the year 1 from the birth of Jesus, which was the first year of his life, not the one that started when he turned 1. ''Anno urbis conditae'', on the other hand, I have only encountered on Wikipedia, but I suppose it uses the same logic. Which means that 1 AUC = 1 AUC = 753 BCE. Radulfr (talk) 21:20, 1 January 2016 (UTC)Incarnation or Nativity?User:95.112.54.39 changed incarnation to birth of Jesus in , with the edit summary"Incarnation" is a theological concept, I've replaced them with "birth of JofN" and "stories of the birth of JC", which are more precise.I have reverted the edit, because the Incarnation (where the capitalized Incarnation refers specifically to the incarnation of Jesus) is not just a theological issue, it also involves a date issue. Due to the date issue, "birth of Jesus" is ''too'' precise.Some ancient authors thought the Incarnation occurred when Jesus was born; this date is not known, nor do we know what date Dionysius Exiguus had in mind when he created the Anno Domini year numbering system. Some authors, including virtually all modern authors, think the Incarnation occurred when Jesus was conceived. That is why Western Christian churches celebrate the Feast of the Annunciation nine months earlier than the Feast of the Nativity (Christmas).But we don't know which viewpoint Dionysius held, and thus we don't know if the origin of our year numbering system is 25 March or 25 December. (We also aren't sure if the year Dionysius had in mind for whichever event was what we now call 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1, but that's a different problem.)So we should stick to "Incarnation" in the article to reflect our lack of exact knowledge, rather than pretend we have knowledge that we don't. Sources for the information in this paragraph may be found in the footnotes to the Anno Domini article.In addition to the correct degree of precision regarding dates, the Incarnation was the event that Dionysius wanted to memorialize by his choice of year numbering system. So it is more accurate to refer to the event that inspired the inventor, regardless of our opinions about the event. Jc3s5h (talk) 13:31, 3 December 2014 (UTC)
