Nonsense titleEnglish is English, it is as simple as that.  I certainly see justification for articles about bastardised versions of English, such as American English, Australian English etc, but to say "British English" is just wrong.  English is the source, it requires no additional words in its title.Yevad (talk) 13:11, 19 July 2013 (UTC)Yea, but you know how it is with americans and such...thinking they own the fucking world all the time.. ;.; Special:Contributions/178.174.232.139|178.174.232.139 (talk) 17:29, 30 August 2013 (UTC)...Different spelling forms (U and non-U as Nancy Mitford might have put it), different words (and sometimes concepts) (Scottish 'upwith') and different grammar ('to write someone' or to write to someone' etc.With the 'This is written in British English' message should it not be '...different [to] or absent from...' (which sounds better in London English)? Jackiespeel (talk) 13:52, 13 January 2014 (UTC):Moved page to English (UK). Still should be called English, but at least this regains the page a little of what it deserves. Jackiespeel, you could create a London English page. --Warner REBORN (talk) 12:29, 24 July 2014 (UTC)::agreed. english is the common name of the language, British is redundant. a few words like aeroplane are commonly misspelled/mispronounced outside the UK, yet not enough to justify the title.

Google seems to agree, giving me a long list of hits for the search words: "baby shower" site:co.uk.

It's a bit offensive to claim a people's language is just a variant. There isn't a French French page, the French of France is just considered the original. Its quite racist to appropriate someone else's culture.:Actually there IS a "French French" page. It's called Standard French because French is a regulated language which recognizes the dialect of the home country as the norm. English is NOT a regulated language and all dialects are equally recognized. In linguistics all forms of English are variants with no one form being seen as the original, much as in chemistry all nuclides are considered isotopes with no non-variant form for any element or how in biology the two cells formed in the process of mitotic division are both considered "daughter cells" with neither being the original. British English and American English (not to mention all the other forms) have each diverged since their separation, neither can lay claim to being the "pure" original. And I fail to see how this could be "racist" as neither English (the nationality) or American are races. --Khajidha (talk) 13:12, 1 February 2016 (UTC)KJV would be for?British English and Archaic English would be seen in King James Bible.  â€”Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/112.209.65.144|112.209.65.144 (talk) 03:33, 7 February 2016 (UTC);;; ;;
