Certainly it's all nonsense (aside from being badly written), but if it's nonsense that some specific group of people believe, there's no reason not to report on that belief.

The word “amburus” in the sense of “Amber” did belong to vernacular language and will not be found in Latin scriptures. Historic documents are using the Germanic word “Glaesum” instead.The etymology of the verb „amburo“ is rather complicated. Amburo sources from the Latin verb “uro”:Latin: uro ;ndash; ussi  - ustum,1.	to burn something or somebody,2.	to dry up, to scorch3.	to passionBesides uro also buro developed in time, eg. in comburo, bussi, bustum, translated: to burn / to scorch or to bust.In contrast we find also de-uro, translated: to burn down, indicating the original core must be read "uro" and not "buro".Maybe/Probably the English verb "burn" sources from "buro".The word amber is spread accross a great number of people and modern languages, like French (ambre jaune), Italian (ambra gialla), Spanish (el ambar). Unlike the British sailors they certainly were not familiar with walefishing and some early language, maybe Latin, must have provided the word.Originally the adjective “amburus” in Latin accompanied the male word “Lapis” (Stone) and checking the gender in languages we do not find any discrepancies.See for complete details:English Version:German/Deutsche Version:;mdash;''The preceding unsigned comment was added by'' 217.248.171.161 (talk•Special:Contributions/217.248.171.161|contribs) 04:45, 23 May 2005.;;;mdash;''The preceding unsigned comment was added by'' 217.248.175.62 (talk•Special:Contributions/217.248.175.62|contribs) 03:03, 24 May 2005.;;;Sorry, these were my contributions.

Mosquitoes aren't actually that common as amber inclusions, and very few have been found in cretaceous Burmite or other dinosaur era amber.  It should be noted, however, that biting midges are actually quite common and engorged ticks are occasionally found as well. The blood meals of such insects are seldom preserved even in Dominican amber and the chances of finding it in the much rarer dinosaur era inclusions are slim indeed.Most authorities now agree that even if such blood meals were found, the DNA of the source would not be found. Even the people who first reported finding insect DNA in Dominican amber now admit that they were mistaken.There are other issues such as the fact that DNA reconstructed artificially is unstable and breaks down by the time a few hundred base pairs are added, as well as this issue of how you construct an embryo from its DNA even once you have all its chromosomes fully built, but this is getting off topic for this article.John Elson (talk) 05:43, 2 August 2011 (UTC)I agree that amber's use in the Jurassic Park stories is notable, because they were popular enough that many people probably know of amber specifically through the Jurassic Park books or films.It also caused the price of amber to shoot up.

You have to specify: Baltic amber, Dominican amber etc., in my opinion whenever just the word "amber" is used, it has to mean Baltic amber. This is the fossil resin humans used since 30000 years ago, the one that played such important role in shaping European civilisation. Only recently other fossil resins became more known and scientists for ease of communication started calling other fossil resins "amber"- dealers and public after "Jurassic Park" made this word common without caring for what it means.Value? Well, Baltic amber obtained by excavation in Kalliningrad in its heyday, was 1000 tons a year. Only about 300 tons of it were jewellery quality. Today that mine produces mere 200 tons per year. So quality rough Baltic amber is scarce. Poland's jewellery industry uses about 200 tons of it every year. Sure Ukraine has deposits of Baltic amber that in recent years were began to be mined. But there is like, only one legal operation, the rest is gray market. This equals to supply in the tens of tons per year.Dominican and Mexican amber, excavated by hand is a specialty item in global view. An output of aprox. 5 tons per year from each locality has no effect on jewellery market, but is important for its animal inclusions. Its red, green and blue varieties are highly sought after and pricey.For Baltic amber, of course value depends on size of pieces. The larger the more rare and more expensive. I have held in my hands a 3 kilo piece- it looked just like a loaf of bread!Market prices are often published in Bursztynisko, a magazine of International Amber Association.Amberif, an amber and jewellery fair organised in Gdansk, Poland every March is a great place to sense the amber industry trends. There, two years ago the Russian rough amber dealers changed prices from US$ to Euro currency- same numbers, but a 30% jump in price! (this, if I remember it correctly without checking records. Also, any numbers quoted above- I have quotable sources for and can provide the details). ````  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Kuczman (talk • Special:Contributions/Kuczman|contribs) 03:33, 20 July 2008 (UTC);;; ;;:For quite a while it was $1 a gram.Special:Contributions/77.100.108.4|77.100.108.4 (talk) 16:42, 6 February 2010 (UTC)Sub-fossilWhat is meant by sub-fossil at end of first paragraph?

OK amber comes from trees; ok it has bugs in it, is used for this ; that. But *how* does it get from A to D? Where in trees does it come from? What kinds of trees? Where are they? How long does that take for huge chunks? Where are they found (are they still found?) What happens to it then? How long does it take to harden? How does it trap a bug? Does it need to be buried to last 30 million years? Where can I find some? Twang (talk) 07:29, 9 April 2010 (UTC)I'll try to answer a few of your questions:'''''How long does it take to harden?'''''It depends on the conditions, but it takes anywhere from a few years to a few hundred years for resin to harden, at which point it is known as copal. It takes much longer for it to fully fossilize. Normally, resin that is out in the open or simply buried in the ground will begin to break down and in a few hundred years to a thousand years will be nothing but dust. It is only when copal finds it way into the right kind of sediment that copal is preserved and the process of fossilization, which takes millions of years, can take place. Once it is fully fossilized, the resin is then known as amber. Most resin never becomes amber just as most animals never become fossils.'''''How does it trap a bug?'''''I'll assume that you actually mean "invertebrate" since most amber inclusions are not bugs but rather other kinds of insects and non insects such as spiders. There are actually two main ways this can happen:#1 The animal gets stuck in the resin, which is very sticky, much like flypaper, and either digs itself in deeper in the struggle to escape or after it gets stuck more resin flows over it till it is completely covered.#2 The animal gets caught in a resin flow after its death, making no attempt to escape simply because it is already dead. On rare occasions larger animals such as frogs and lizards have been submerged in resin after their death. These animals would usually be able to free themselves from the resin and so ordinarily aren't found in amber. The same is true of larger invertebrates such as cockroaches, centipedes and large scorpions. Sometimes the animal caught in the resin this way has already begun to decompose, and is preserved in a partially decomposed state. Parts of animals discarded by sloppy predators can also be submerged in resin the same way.'''''What happens to it then?'''''I'm not sure exactly what you mean by this but amber remains preserved only as long as it is in a rock matrix. Once amber is removed from the matrix it begins to break down. Within a hundred years, the surface crusts over and the amber will begin to crack. After a few hundred to a thousand years or so it will be reduced to dust. An amber necklace buried in a tomb for 1500 years which originally had over a hundred stones had only a few broken pieces left when it was unearthed, most of the pieces having turned to dust.  Museums are looking for ways to arrest this process in  their prized amber pieces.Note that some features of amber are even more ephemeral than this. Occasionally an inclusion in Dominican amber will show a small hint of color when first polished, but in a couple of years it is gone. Enhydros, moving air bubbles contained in pockets of water (or other liquid), will sometimes disappear in just a few months.'''''Where can I find some? ''''' Dominican amber is found in mines in the Dominican republic. Extracting amber from the rock in these mines is a dangerous activity and I don't recommend it. Baltic amber is contained in rock deposits beneath the Baltic sea. It isn't practical to dive down there and mine it directly, but geological activity occasionally liberates amber from the rock and, because it is lighter than sea water (albeit heavier than fresh water) it will float to the surface where it can either be skimmed up in nets or picked up off the beach. It hardly seems worth the trip though!Probably the best place to find amber is where I got most of mine, on sites such as eBay.John Elson (talk) 04:45, 2 August 2011 (UTC)This is great material and more of it should be in the Page.IceDragon64 (talk) 19:57, 14 August 2014 (UTC)Indonesian blue amberI reverted the addition of a new section on blue amber from Indonesia as it was unsupported by sources and I have been unable to find any - it read a bit like an advert.

While not rare or valuable.. " - so the reader should wonder why is it included? In this case, the image could simply be replaced by its caption. Further ".. such pieces can be fascinating to view in stereoscopic detail." - this phrase does call for a fascinating image :-), which this one is not. Materialscientist (talk) 06:51, 2 August 2011 (UTC)Actually there is a very good reason to include it, though you seem to have missed the point. The images of amber included in the article are all of pieces that have large inclusions or are of jewelry grade. This gives a misleading impression. There are many amber pieces such as this one which contain miscellaneous debris and are fascinating to look at, especially through a stereo microscope or in a large stereoscopic image. The description probably could have explained that a little better, and "conclusions" should have been "inclusions" but that is no reason for removing the image altogether.As for anaglyph, I myself prefer stereo pairs, but anaglyphs are more accessible to most people. The larger image seen when this one is clicked on does a much better job of showing the "depth contrast", as you put it, then a conventional photograph would.

There was surely a lot more whaling of sperm whales in the second half of the last millenium,  than the first half of the last millenium.Eregli bob (talk) 03:14, 14 May 2013 (UTC)Another inconsistency: geological record section claims oldest arthropod inclusions are Cretaceous (~120mya) but subsequent section cites mites in much older Triassic Amber (~230mya). Mites are Arthropoda.

It was most likely accidentally burned by the Soviet soldiers. There isn't enough evidence for that one way or another. The point is though that while the Amber Room was reconstructed, it was done so using old black and white photographs and using amber mined from the same region as the original.

As far as I could tell from the rest of the internet, no actual Amber has been used in parfumes. I am not an expert on this part, so I won't edit it, but the text itself also speaks about Ambergris. At least it was rather confusing to me.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by VDhorses (talk • Special:Contributions/VDhorses|contribs) 07:01, 17 June 2015 (UTC);;; ;;Copyvio removedI've removed the section ==Classification of Baltic amber by the IAA== as it was a copy paste of copyrighted content from  added five years ago by a now inactive user. If someone wishes they are welcome to rewrite the removed section with attribution to avoid the copyvio problem. Vsmith (talk) 01:11, 21 August 2015 (UTC)SourcesMuch of the section on processing is in a form of academic English that passed out of style a century ago.  It's basically 19th-century English, lifted whole from some book. The source should be acknowledged.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/86.187.154.106|86.187.154.106 (talk) 20:02, 5 September 2015 (UTC);;; ;;Oldest AmberOldest amber with microfossils is as old as 220 Ma, from the Triassic of the Dolomites (Italy).
