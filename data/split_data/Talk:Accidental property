I'll be back to work on this latter, a second reading makes me think that the discusson of possible worlds with it's indirect reference to contemporary modal logic does not belong in the middle of talk about the Aristotelian logic, though I do think it belongs on this page. MRCOne problem with the existing text: it says that being single is an essential property of bachelors.  This isn't quite right.  True, being single is an essential property of bachelors ''qua bachelors''; but being single is an accidental property of bachelors ''simpliciter'', since for any bachelor you care to name there is a possible world in which he's married.--Algernon1980 10:49, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
