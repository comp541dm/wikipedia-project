London: George Newnes, 1961, Vol.1, p.497. but the derivation of this name is uncertain. The traditional etymology is from the verb ''aperire'', "to open", in allusion to its being the season when trees and flowers begin to "open", which is supported by comparison with the modern Greek use of wikt:άνοιξη#Greek|άνοιξη (''ánixi'') (opening) for spring. Since some of the Roman months were named in honor of divinities, and as April was sacred to the goddess Venus, her Veneralia being held on the first day, it has been suggested that Aprilis was originally her month '''Aphrilis''', from her equivalent Greek goddess name Aphrodite (''Aphros''), or from the Etruscan name ''Apru''. Jacob Grimm suggests the name of a hypothetical god or hero, ''Aper'' or ''Aprus''.Jacob Grim ''Geschichte der deutschen Sprache''. Cap. "Monate"April was the second month of the earliest Roman calendar, before ''Ianuarius'' and ''Februarius'' were added by King Numa Pompilius about 700BC. It became the fourth month of the calendar year (the year when twelve months are displayed in order) during the time of the decemvirs about 450BC, when it also was given 29days. The 30th day was added during the reform of the calendar undertaken by Julius Caesar in the mid-40sBC, which produced the Julian calendar.The Anglo-Saxons called April ''ēastre-monaþ''. The Venerable Bede says in ''The Reckoning of Time'' that this month ''ēastre'' is the root of the word Easter. He further states that the month was named after a goddess ''Eostre'' whose feast was in that month. It is also attested by Einhard in his work, Vita Karoli Magni.St George's day is the twenty-third of the month; and St Mark's Eve, with its superstition that the ghosts of those who are doomed to die within the year will be seen to pass into the church, falls on the twenty-fourth.In China the symbolic ploughing of the earth by the emperor and princes of the blood took place in their third month, which frequently corresponds to April. In Finnish April is ''huhtikuu'', meaning ''slash-and-burn moon'', when gymnosperms for beat and burn clearing of farmland were felled.1911In Slovene, the most established traditional name is ''mali traven'', meaning the month when plants start growing. It was first written in 1466 in the Škofja Loka manuscript.'The month Aprilis had 30days; Numa Pompilius made it 29days long; finally Julius Caesar’s calendar reform made it again 30days long, which was not changed in the calendar revision of Augustus Caesar in 8BC.Events in AprilMonth-long observances*Donate Life Month*Autism Awareness Month / Autism Acceptance Month*Occupational Therapy (OT) Month*Rape Awareness MonthFile:Hong Kong Budha.jpg|right|thumb|Buddha's Birthday is celebrated in April (here is pictured the Tian Tan Buddha in Hong Kong)*Jazz Appreciation Month (United States)*National Poetry Month (United States)*National Poetry Writing Month*Parkinson's Disease Awareness Month (International)*Confederate History Month (southern United States)-April 26*National Arab American Heritage Month (United States)*National Child Abuse Prevention Month (United States)*Sexual Assault Awareness Month (United States)*Financial Literacy Month (United States)*National Stress Awareness Month (United States)Non-Gregorian observances, 2016*Yom Kippur Katan (Jewish calendar) - April 8*Rosh Chodesh of Nisan (Jewish calendar)- April 9*Bedikas Chametz (Jewish calendar)  - April 21*Ridván (Bahai) 2016 date: April 21 - May 2*Fast of the Firstborn (Jewish calendar) - April 22*Passover (Jewish calendar)  – April 23-30*Counting of the Omer (Jewish calendar) - 2016 date: April 23-June 11.Movable observances*Ulcinj Day – first Saturday in April*Opening Day – first Sunday in April*International Trombone Week - varies.
