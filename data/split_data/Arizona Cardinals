The '''Arizona Cardinals''' are a professional American football franchise based in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The Cardinals compete in the National Football League as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) West division. The Cardinals were founded 1898 in 1898, and are the oldest continuously run professional football team in the United States.The team was established in Chicago in 1898 and was a charter member of the NFL in 1920. Along with the Chicago Bears, the club is one of two NFL charter member franchises still in  operation since the league's founding. (The Green Bay Packers were an independent team until they joined the NFL in 1921). The club then moved to St. Louis in 1960 and played in that city through 1987 (sometimes referred to as the "Football Cardinals" or the "Big Red" to avoid confusion with the Major League Baseball St. Louis Cardinals). Before the 1988 season, the team moved west to Tempe, Arizona, a college suburb east of Phoenix, and played their home games for the next 18 seasons at Arizona State University's Sun Devil Stadium. In 2006, the club began playing all home games at the newly constructed University of Phoenix Stadium in the northwestern suburb of Glendale, although the team's training facility is in Tempe.The franchise has won two NFL championships, both while it was based in Chicago. The first occurred in 1925, but is the subject of controversy, with supporters of the Pottsville Maroons believing that Pottsville should have won the title. Their second title, and the first to be won in a championship game, came in 1947, nearly two decades before the first Super Bowl. They returned to the title game to defend in 1948, but lost the rematch 7–0 in a snowstorm in Philadelphia.Since winning the championship in 1947, the team suffered many losing seasons, and currently holds the league's longest active championship drought, at 67 consecutive seasons. In 2012 the Cardinals became the first NFL franchise to lose 700 games since its inception. The franchise's all-time win-loss record (including regular season and playoff games) at the conclusion of the 2015 season is 542–733–39 (535–724–39 in the regular season, 7–9 in the playoffs). They have been to the playoffs ten times and have won seven playoff games, three of which were victories during their run in the 2008–09 NFL playoffs. During that season, they won their only NFC Championship Game since the 1970 AFL–NFL merger, and reached Super Bowl XLIII. The team has also won five division titles (1974, 1975, 2008, 2009 and 2015) since their 1947–1948 NFL championship game appearances. The Cardinals are the only NFL team who have never lost a playoff game at home, with a 5-0 record: the 1947 NFL Championship Game, two postseason victories during the aforementioned 2008–09 NFL playoffs, one during the 2009–10 NFL playoffs|2009-10 playoffs, and one during the 2015-2016 NFL playoffs.From 1988 through 2012 (except 2005, when they trained in Prescott), the Cardinals conducted their annual summer training camp at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. The Cardinals moved their training camp to University of Phoenix Stadium in 2013. The stadium was the site of the 2015 Pro Bowl, unlike in past years, where it was held at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu, Hawaii. The stadium also played host to Super Bowls XLII and XLIX.Franchise historyHistory of the Arizona CardinalsChicagoHistory of the Chicago CardinalsThe franchise's inception dates back to 1898, when a neighborhood group gathered to play in the Chicago South Side, calling themselves Morgan Athletic Club. Chicago painting and building contractor Chris O'Brien acquired the team, which he relocated to Normal Field in Racine Avenue. The team was known as Racine Normals until 1901, when O'Brien bought used jerseys from the University of Chicago. He described the faded maroon clothing as "Cardinal red" and the team became the Racine Street Cardinals. The team eventually became in 1920 a charter member of the American Professional Football Association (APFA), which two years later was rechristened to National Football League (NFL). The team entered the league as the Racine Cardinals, however the name was changed in 1922 to Chicago Cardinals to avoid confusion with the Horlick-Racine Legion who entered the league the same year. Except for 1925, when they were awarded the championship after the Pottsville Maroons were suspended, the Cardinals experienced only minimal success on the playing field during their first 26 seasons in the league. During the post-World War II years, the team reached two straight NFL finals against the Philadelphia Eagles, winning in 1947 - eight months after the death of owner Charles Bidwill - and losing the 1948 NFL Championship Game the following year. After years of bad seasons and losing fans to the cross-town rivals Chicago Bears, by the late 1950s the Cardinals were almost bankrupt, and owner Violet Bidwill Wolfner became interested in a relocation.St. LouisHistory of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)Due to the formation of the rival American Football League, the NFL allowed Bidwill to relocate the team to St. Louis, Missouri, where they became the St. Louis Cardinals (nicknamed "Football Cardinals" due to sharing a name with the city's baseball team). During the Cardinals' 28-year stay in St. Louis, they advanced to the playoffs just three times (1974, 1975 ; 1982), never hosting or winning in any appearance. The overall mediocrity of the Cardinals, combined with a then-21 year old stadium, caused game attendance to dwindle, and owner Bill Bidwill decided to move the team to Arizona.Phoenix, ArizonaNot long after the 1987 NFL season, Bidwill agreed to move to the Phoenix metropolitan area on a handshake deal with state and local officials, and the team became the Phoenix Cardinals. In 1994, the franchise changed to its current name of Arizona Cardinals due to fan preference. The 1998 NFL season made the Cardinals break two long droughts, qualifying for the playoffs for the first time in 16 years, and by winning the Wild Card Playoffs, getting their first postseason win since 1947. Ten years later, the Cardinals won the NFC Championship Game  to advance to the Super Bowl for the first time in franchise history. They lost Super Bowl XLIII 27-23 to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the final seconds.UniformsImage:NFCW-Throwback2-Uniform-ARI.PNG|thumb|left|150px|Phoenix Cardinals uniform: 1989–1995Image:NFC-Throwback-Uniform-ARI.PNG|thumb|left|150px|Arizona Cardinals uniform: 1996–2004The team has worn cardinal red jerseys since Chris O'Brien bought them for the club in 1898. For most of their history, the Cardinals have used the same basic uniform design of white helmets, white pants with red stripes on the sides, and either red or white jerseys.Chicago Cardinals logo.Starting in 1947, the team had a logo of a cardinal bird perched on the stitches of a football. However, the club did not attach a logo to their helmets until they debuted a cardinal-head logo in 1960, the year the franchise moved from Chicago to St. Louis.During their 28 years in St. Louis, the Cardinals frequently wore white at home, especially for games vs. the Dallas Cowboys, hoping to bring out the "blue jersey jinx" which supposedly follows the Cowboys. The Cardinals wore white at home at least twice in every season since 1964 and for every home game in 1964, 1965, and 1978. They wore white for their 1982 and 1983 home games vs. Dallas, but not at all from 1984 through 1987.The Cardinals moved to Arizona in 1988, and the flag of Arizona was added to the sleeves the following year. In 1990, the team began wearing red pants with their white jerseys, as new coach Joe Bugel wanted to emulate his former employer, the Washington Redskins, who at the time wore burgundy pants with their white jerseys (the Redskins later returned to their 1970s gold pants with all their jerseys).In 1994, the Cardinals participated in the NFL's 75th anniversary throwback uniform program. The jerseys were similar to those of the 1920s Chicago Cardinals, with an interlocking "CC" logo and three stripes on each sleeve. The uniform numbers were relocated to the right chest. The pants were khaki to simulate the color and material used in that era. The Cardinals also stripped the logos from their helmets for the two games, at Cleveland (Sept. 18) and home vs. Pittsburgh (Oct. 30).The Cardinal head on the helmet was repeated on the white jersey from 1982 to 1995. In 1996, the state flag of Arizona was moved higher on the sleeve after the Cardinal head was eliminated, and black was removed as an accent color, instead replaced with a blue to match the predominant color of the state flag. In 2002, the Cardinals began to wear all-red and all-white combinations, and continued to do so through 2004, prior to the team's makeover.In 2005, the team unveiled its first major changes in a century. The cardinal-head logo was updated to look sleeker and meaner than its predecessor. Numerous fans had derisively called the previous version a "parakeet". Black again became an accent color after an eight-year absence, while trim lines were added to the outside shoulders, sleeves, and sides of the jerseys and pants. Both the red and white jerseys have the option of red or white pants.Hoping to break a six-game losing streak, the Cardinals wore the red pants for the first time on October 29, 2006, in a game at Lambeau Field against the Green Bay Packers. The Packers won 31–14, and the Cards headed into their bye week with a 1–7 mark. Following the bye week, the Cardinals came out in an all-red combination at home against the Dallas Cowboys and lost, 27–10. Arizona did not wear the red pants for the remainder of the season and won four of their last seven games. However, the following season, in 2007, the Cardinals again wore their red pants for their final 3 home games. They wore red pants with white jerseys in games on the road at the Cincinnati Bengals and Seattle Seahawks. They paired red pants with red jerseys, the all-red combination, for home games against the Detroit Lions, San Francisco 49ers, Cleveland Browns, and St. Louis Rams. The red pants were not worn at all in 2008, but they were used in home games vs. Seattle, Minnesota, and St. Louis in 2009. The red pants were paired with the white road jersey for the first time in three years during a 2010 game at Carolina, but the white jersey/red pants combination was not used in 2011.The Cardinals' first home game in Arizona, in 1988, saw them play in red jerseys. Thereafter, for the next 18 years in Arizona, the Cardinals, like a few other NFL teams in warm climates, wore their white jerseys at home during the first half of the season—forcing opponents to suffer in their darker jerseys during Arizona autumns that frequently see temperatures over 100°F (38°C). However, this tradition did not continue when the Cardinals moved from Sun Devil Stadium to University of Phoenix Stadium in 2006, as early-season games (and some home games late in the season) were played with the roof closed. With the temperature inside at a comfortable 70°F (21°C), the team opted to wear red jerseys at home full-time. The Cardinals wore white jerseys at home for the first time in University of Phoenix Stadium on August 29, 2008, in a preseason game against the Denver Broncos.The Cardinals wore white at home for the first time in a regular season game at University of Phoenix Stadium against the Houston Texans on October 11, 2009. In October 2009, the NFL recognized Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and players wore pink-accented items, including gloves, wristbands, and shoes. The team thought the pink accents looked better with white uniforms than with red.On many occasions, when hosting the Dallas Cowboys, the Cardinals would wear white in order to force the Cowboys to don their "jinxed" blue jerseys. They have not done this since moving into University of Phoenix Stadium, however.The 2010 season saw the Cardinals debut a new, alternate black jersey. Prior to its introduction, the Cardinals were the only NFL team without an alternate jersey or throwback kit, save for the NFL's 75th anniversary program in 1994.Season-by-season recordsList of Arizona Cardinals seasonsSingle-season records'''Points Scored''': 489 (2015)'''Passing'''* '''Passing Yards''': 4,671 Carson Palmer (2015)* '''Passing Touchdowns''': 35 Carson Palmer (2015)* '''Passes Completed''': 401 Kurt Warner (2008)* '''Passes Attempted''': 598 Kurt Warner (2008)* '''Longest Completed Pass Thrown''': 98 Yards Doug Russell (1932) / Ogden Compton (1957) / Jim Hart (1972)* '''Consecutive Games With a Touchdown Pass''': 22 Kurt Warner (2007–2008)'''Rushing'''* '''Rushing Yards''': 1,605 Ottis Anderson (1979)* '''Rushing Attempts''': 337 Edgerrin James (2006)* '''Rushing Touchdowns''': 14 John David Crow (1962)* '''Rushing Touchdowns (Rookie)''': 10 Tim Hightower (2008)* '''Longest Rushing Attempt''': 83 yards John David Crow (1958)* '''Rushing Yards Per Game''': 100.3 yards Ottis Anderson (1979)'''Receiving'''* '''Receptions''': 109 Larry Fitzgerald (2015)* '''Receiving Yards''': 1,598 David Boston (2001)* '''Receiving Touchdowns''': 15 Sonny Randle (1960)'''Returns'''* '''Punt Returns in a Season''': 44 Vai Sikahema (1987)* '''Longest Punt Return''': 99 yards Patrick Peterson (2011)* '''Longest Kickoff Return''': 108 yards David Johnson (2015)'''Kicking'''* '''Field Goals''': 40 Neil Rackers (2005)* '''Extra Points Made''': 53 Pat Harder (1948)Cardinals career records* '''Passing Yards''': 34,639, Jim Hart (1966–1983)* '''Passing Touchdowns''': 209, Jim Hart (1966–1983)* '''Rushing Yards''': 7,999, Ottis Anderson (1979–1986)* '''Receptions''': 1,018, Larry Fitzgerald (2004–present)* '''Receiving Yards''': 13,366, Larry Fitzgerald (2004–present)* '''Pass Interceptions''': 52, Larry Wilson (1960–1972)* '''Field Goals Made''': 282, Jim Bakken (1962–1978)* '''Points''': 1,380, Jim Bakken (1962–1978)* '''Total Touchdowns''': 98, Larry Fitzgerald (2004–present)* '''Punt Return Average''': 13.7, Adrian Trippi (1947–1955)* '''Kickoff Return Average''': 28.5, Ollie Matson (1952, 1954–1958)* '''Punting Average''': 44.9, Jerry Norton (1959–1961)* '''Sacks''': 66.5, Freddie Joe Nunn (1985–1993)Notable playersCurrent rosterRetired numbers{| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align:center"| colspan="5" style="background:#97233F; color:#FFFFFF"|'''Arizona Cardinals retired numbers'''|-! width="40" style="background:#97233F; color:#FFFFFF" |N°! width="150" style="background:#97233F; color:#FFFFFF" |Player! width="40" style="background:#97233F; color:#FFFFFF" |Position! width="150" style="background:#97233F; color:#FFFFFF" |Tenure! width="100" style="background:#97233F; color:#FFFFFF" |Team based in|-|-| '''8''' || Larry Wilson  || S || 1960–1972 || St. Louis|-|  '''40''' || Pat Tillman 1 || S || 1998–2001 ||  Arizona|-| '''77''' || Stan Mauldin 1 ||  OT || 1946–1948  || Chicago|-| '''88''' || J.

KMVP assumed the broadcast rights in 2006 after many years on KSLX-FM and KDUS. Dave Pasch, Ron Wolfley, and Paul Calvisi handle the radio broadcast. Most preseason games are televised on KNXV, channel 15, the local ABC affiliate. Pasch and Wolfley are also the TV announcers.On New Year's Day 2007, KMVP began a simulcast of KTAR, which switched to an all-sports format (the news/talk station became 92.3, KTAR-FM). For the 2007 season, KTAR was the official flagship station; however, some broadcasts were also heard on 92.3 FM because of conflicts with Arizona Diamondbacks baseball games on 620 AM.In January 2014, Bonneville International, owners of KTAR and KMVP, created Arizona Sports 98.7 (KMVP-FM), a new local FM sports talk outlet. All Cardinals games in 2014 and beyond have been heard on KMVP-FM.Spanish-language radio broadcasts are heard on the combo of KQMR|KQMR/KHOV-FM "Latino Mix" under a contract with Univisión, signed in 2015., ''Media Moves'' 28 August 2015 Prior to 2015, they were heard on KDVA/KVVA-FM "José FM", as well as co-owned KBMB AM 710. The Cardinals were the first NFL team to offer all 20 preseason and regular season games on Spanish-language radio, doing so in 2000. Gabriel Trujillo and Rolando Cantú are the Spanish broadcast team.The Cardinals have the most extensive Mexican affiliate network in the NFL, with contracts with Grupo Larsa (in the state of Sonora) and Grupo Radiorama (outside Sonora) and stations in 20 cities, including Hermosillo, Guadalajara and Mexico City.English radio affiliates;;}}{| class="wikitable"|-!style="background:#97233F; color:#FFFFFF"|City !! style="background:#97233F; color:#FFFFFF"|Call Sign !! style="background:#97233F; color:#FFFFFF"|Frequency|-| Phoenix, Arizona || KTAR AM || 620 AM|-| Phoenix, Arizona || KMVP-FM || 98.7 FM|-| Safford, Arizona || KATO AM || 1230 AM|-| Sedona, Arizona || KAZM AM || 780 AM|-| Lake Havasu City, Arizona || KNTR AM || 980 AM|-| Prescott, Arizona || KQNA AM || 1130 AM|-| Prescott, Arizona || KDDL FM || 94.3 FM|-| Flagstaff, Arizona || KVNA AM || 600 AM|-| Holbrook, Arizona || KZUA-FM || 92.1 FM|-| Yuma, Arizona || KBLU || 560 AM|-| Pinetop, Arizona || KNKI FM || 106.7 FM|-| Miami, Arizona || KIKO AM || 1340 AM|-| Tucson, Arizona || KEVT AM || 1210 AM|-| Kingman, Arizona || KGMN-FM || 100.1 FM|}MiscellaneousDue to Phoenix's high temperature and strong sunshine in early September, eight of the team's first 13 home openers in Arizona were held, at earliest, in week three. In 1989, 1990 and 1991, the Cardinals opened with three consecutive road games before finally coming home in week four. For the same reason, the team's home opener was a nationally-televised night game (two ''Monday Night Football'' games and 11 ''Sunday Night Football'' (ESPN) games) from 1988 to 2001. The team hosted nine straight home openers as ''Sunday Night Football'' games from 1990 to 1998.In 2001, the NFL schedule and the September 11 attacks allowed the Cardinals to play their first two games at home. Since the NFL had an odd number of teams (31) from 1999 through 2001, there had to be at least one bye in every week of the season. In 2001, the Cardinals' bye was week one. They were scheduled to travel to Washington in week two, but the game was postponed due to the terrorist attacks and moved to the very end of the slate. The Cardinals' scheduled home opener, a ''Sunday Night Football'' game vs. Denver, became the season opener, the only time Arizona played its season opener at home when it resided at Sun Devil Stadium. Arizona also played at home the next week vs. Atlanta.Patrick Daniel "Pat" Tillman (November 6, 1976 – April 22, 2004) was an American football player who left his professional career while with the Arizona Cardinals and enlisted in the United States Army in June 2002 in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. His service in Iraq and Afghanistan, and subsequent death, were the subject of much media attention.References2Further reading* Ziemba, Joe (2010).
