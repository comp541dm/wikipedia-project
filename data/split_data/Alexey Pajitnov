Pajitnov'''Alexey Leonidovich Pajitnov''' (, ; ;;; born 14 March 1956) is a Russian video game designer and computer engineer who developed the popular game ''Tetris'' while working for the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, a Soviet government-founded Research and development|R;D center.He only started to get royalties from his creation in 1996 when he and Henk Rogers formed The Tetris Company.BiographyAlexey Pajitnov created ''Tetris'' with the help of Dmitry Pavlovsky and Vadim Gerasimov in 1984. The game, first available in the Soviet Union, appeared in the West in 1986.Pajitnov also created the lesser known sequel to ''Tetris'', entitled ''Welltris'', which has the same principle but in a three dimensional environment where the player sees the playing area from above. ''Tetris'' was licensed and managed by Soviet company ELORG which had been founded specially for this purpose, and advertised with the slogan ''"From Russia with Love"'' (on NES: ''"From Russia With Fun!"''). Because he was employed by the Soviet government, Pajitnov did not receive royalties.Pajitnov, together with Vladimir Pokhilko, moved to the United States in 1991 and later, in 1996, founded The Tetris Company with Henk Rogers. He helped design the puzzles in the Super NES versions of ''Yoshi's Cookie'' and designed the game ''Pandora's Box'', which incorporates more traditional jigsaw-style puzzles.He was employed by Microsoft from October 1996 until 2005. While there he worked on the ''Microsoft Entertainment Pack: The Puzzle Collection'', MSN Mind Aerobics and MSN Games groups. Pajitnov's new, enhanced version of ''Hexic'', ''Hexic HD'', was included with every new Xbox 360 Premium package.On August 18, 2005, WildSnake Software announced Pajitnov will be collaborating with them to release a new line of puzzle games.Works{|border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%; text-align: center;"|-!
