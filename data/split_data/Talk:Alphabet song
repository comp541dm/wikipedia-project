"Zee"I'm not sure *where* my variant comes from; at first I was thinking it might be a local Canadian one, but the fact that it uses the pronunciation "zee" for "Z" (look at the rhymes) makes me think not. -- Paul DryeHaddocks Eyeshow is Haddocks Eyes related to the alphabet song? -- Tarquin:I for one have no idea. It seems more related to "The House that Jack Built". Removed the link. --AnonymousDisputed=== "(z = zee to rhyme with v, not zed)"This was not true where I learned it (Ontario, Canada.) I don't believe this is how it's universally sung. Jonathan Grynspan:I agree.  I added a note reflecting the assertion to American and British English differences, which was quickly , so I also assume it can be sung with ''zed''.  I guess the lack of rhyme is not troubling to non-Americans.  After all, American children call Chicken Licken ''Chicken Little'', which throws that rhyme out. Joestynes 07:43, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC):I've tried another wording to see if we can get the 'disputed' off the page. My big question is, where does the 'what does {letter} say' song come from? I suspect it is regional. Niteowlneils 18:22, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC):Actually I remember reading a study about how the younger generation in Canada was starting to pronounce z as "zee" rather than "zed" due to the popularity of the rhyming version of the alphabet song .  I don't know if this should be reflected in the article somehow. --DropDeadGorgias (talk) 04:13, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)::I learnt it with the line "W X Y Z ''you see''", so that we could sing "zed" but still get a rhyme.

And our ending was different. "...U V W X Y Z. X Y Z, Butter on your bread. If you don't like it you'll have to go to bed." This also means that ours had drifted from the original tune somewhat, and it rhymed. 14:04, 27 January 2006 (UTC) (Skittle)''The'' alphabet song?Does anyone outside the USA label it as such?  Otherwise, it would be somewhat POV to single this one out for mention.  If this particular one was officially renamed "The Alphabet Song" then it might be filed as such ... but would C. Bradlee (or indeed anybody who covered it commercially) have ever renamed it to be "The alphabet song" with a lowercase "a" and "s"?Here in the UK, I suppose most of us are acquainted with this version only through Sesame Street in the days when it was shown over here.

Thought it worth a mention. knoodelhed 04:05, 22 October 2005 (UTC)This is also the version taught in some international schools too, like in Japan and China. It should be noted that this version has three advantages over the original grouping: 1.) it avoids the confusing "lmnop" cluster (elemental pee) 2.) there is one less rest in the song, namely between W and X, since the letters are more evenly spread, 3.) there is no "and" between y and z, therefore eliminating the confusion of thinking that ";" is an actual letter of the alphabet.The only advantage I can think for the original is that it consistently rhymes in the American pronunciation of Zee. For education purposes, this grouping seems far more logical.Thegargoylevine (talk) 03:06, 29 July 2014 (UTC)Non-English alphabet songs?I would guess most languages have some kind of alphabet song?

I have now removed it to this talk page because I realized that it does not help the article.  The song in question is not an actual alphabet song used by or for children, AND it is not well-known.  It is a punk song that happens to use the alphabet, in a way reminiscent of children's alphabet songs, for artistic purposes.Initially, I had hoped someone would add an attribution for this song, because I cannot find any mention of it online.

I think this confusion arises because for historical reasons the computer and telecommunications industries based their "Basic Latin alphabet" on the 26 letters of the English alphabet (see Latin alphabet and international standards and ISO/IEC 646). If during the 1960's Italy had dominated the computer and telecommunication industry then the number of letters in the Basic Latin alphabet might well have bee the 21 used in the Italian alphabet. So I think to equate the Latin alphabet with the English alphabet is a systemic bias that people who are fimilar with installing software on PCs make. --PBS 11:30, 1 December 2006 (UTC)Here's a versionHere's a version I can't find any reference for, but I definitely knew this long before Sesame St came along.

So, did the order occur because of the rhyme or was it something else??:Actually, the Latin alphabet got most of its letter order from the Greek alphabet, which got most of its order from the Phoenician alphabet, etc. going back to the fourteenth century BC.
