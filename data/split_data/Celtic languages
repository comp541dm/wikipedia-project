The '''Celtic languages''' (usually pronounced  but sometimes ) are descended from Proto-Celtic, or "Common Celtic"; a branch of the greater Indo-European language family. The term "Celtic" was first used to describe this language group by Edward Lhuyd in 1707, following Paul-Yves Pezron who had already made the explicit link between the Celts described by classical writers and the Welsh and Breton languages.Modern Celtic languages are mostly spoken on the north-western edge of Europe, notably in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Brittany, Cornwall, and the Isle of Man, and can be found spoken on Cape Breton Island. There is also a substantial number of Welsh speakers in the Patagonia area of Argentina. Some people speak Celtic languages in the other Celtic diaspora areas of the United States, on ''Modern Language Association'' website.

Retrieved 5 August 2008 In all these areas, the Celtic languages are now only spoken by minorities though there are continuing efforts at revitalisation. Welsh is the only Celtic language not classified as "endangered" by UNESCO.During the 1st millennium BC, they were spoken across much of Europe, in the Iberian Peninsula, from the Atlantic and North Sea coastlines, up to the Rhine valley and down the Danube valley to the Black Sea, the northern Balkan Peninsula and in central Asia Minor. The spread to Cape Breton and Patagonia occurred in modern times.Living languagesSIL Ethnologue lists six "living" Celtic languages, of which four have retained a substantial number of native speakers. These are the Gaelic languages (i.e. the Irish language and Scottish Gaelic - both descended from Old Irish), and the Brittonic languages (i.e. Welsh and the Breton language - both descended from Old Brittonic).The other two, Cornish and Manx, were spoken into modern times but later died as spoken community languages. For both these languages, however, revitalisation movements have led to the adoption of these languages by adults and children and produced some native speakers.Taken together, there were roughly one million native speakers of Celtic languages as of the 2000s. In 2010, there were more than 1.4 million speakers of Celtic languages.Demographics{| class="wikitable sortable"|-! Language !! Native name !! Grouping !! Number of native speakers !!

This corpus contains some linguistic features that are clearly Celtic and others that in our opinion are not Celtic. The former we shall group, for the moment, under the label northwestern Hispano-Celtic. The latter are the same features found in well-documented contemporary inscriptions in the region occupied by the Lusitanians, and therefore belonging to the variety known as LUSITANIAN, or more broadly as GALLO-LUSITANIAN. As we have already said, we do not consider this variety to belong to the Celtic language family." Jordán Colera 2007: p.750* Gaulish languages, including Galatian and possibly Noric. These languages were once spoken in a wide arc from Belgium to Turkey. They are now all extinct.* Brittonic, including the living languages Breton, Cornish, and Welsh, and the extinct languages Cumbric and Pictish though Pictish may be a sister language rather than a daughter of Common Brittonic.Kenneth H. Jackson suggested that there were two Pictish languages, a pre-Indo-European one and a ''Pritenic'' Celtic one. This has been challenged by some scholars. See Katherine Forsyth's ''"Language in Pictland: the case against 'non-Indo-European Pictish'" '' . See also the introduction by James ; Taylor to the ''"Index of Celtic and Other Elements in W. J. Watson's 'The History of the Celtic Place-names of Scotland'"'' . Compare also the treatment of Pictish in Price's ''The Languages of Britain'' (1984) with his ''Languages in Britain ; Ireland'' (2000). Before the arrival of Scotti on the Isle of Man in the 9th century, there may have been a Brittonic language in the Isle of Man.* Goidelic, including the living languages Irish, Manx, and Scottish Gaelic.Scholarly handling of the Celtic languages has been rather argumentative owing to scarceness of primary source data. Some scholars (such as Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; and Schrijver 1995) distinguish Continental Celtic and Insular Celtic, arguing that the differences between the Goidelic and Brittonic languages arose after these split off from the Continental Celtic languages. Other scholars (such as Schmidt 1988) distinguish between ''P-Celtic'' and ''Q-Celtic'', putting most of the Gaulish and Brittonic languages in the former group and the Goidelic and Celtiberian languages in the latter. The P-Celtic languages (also called Gallo-Brittonic) are sometimes seen (for example by Koch 1992) as a central innovating area as opposed to the more conservative peripheral Q-Celtic languages.The Breton language is Brittonic, not Gaulish, though there may be some input from the latter, having been introduced from Southwestern regions of Britain in the post-Roman era and having evolved into Breton – still partially intelligible by modern Welsh and Cornish speakers.In the P/Q classification schema, the first language to split off from Proto-Celtic was Gaelic. It has characteristics that some scholars see as archaic, but others see as also being in the Brittonic languages (see Schmidt). In the Insular/Continental classification schema, the split of the former into Gaelic and Brittonic is seen as being late.The distinction of Celtic into these four sub-families most likely occurred about 900 BC according to Gray and Atkinson but, because of estimation uncertainty, it could be any time between 1200 and 800 BC. However, they only considered Gaelic and Brythonic. The controversial paper by Forster and Toth included Gaulish and put the break-up much earlier at 3200 BC ± 1500 years. They support the Insular Celtic hypothesis. The early Celts were commonly associated with the archaeological Urnfield culture, the Hallstatt culture, and the La Tène culture, though the earlier assumption of association between language and culture is now considered to be less strong.File:Map of Celtic Nations-flag shades.svg|right|thumb|175px|The Celtic nations, where Celtic languages are spoken today, or were spoken into the modern era:There are legitimate scholarly arguments in favour of both the Insular Celtic hypothesis and the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic hypothesis. Proponents of each schema dispute the accuracy and usefulness of the other's categories. However, since the 1970s the division into Insular and Continental Celtic has become the more widely held view (Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; Schrijver 1995), but in the middle of the 1980s, the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic hypothesis found new supporters (Lambert 1994), because of the inscription on the Larzac piece of lead (1983), the analysis of which reveals another common phonetical innovation ''-nm-'' ; ''-nu'' (Gaelic ''ainm'' / Gaulish ''anuana'', Old Welsh ''enuein'' "names"), that is less accidental than only one. The discovery of a third common innovation, would allow the specialists to come to the conclusion of a Gallo-Brittonic dialect (Schmidt 1986; Fleuriot 1986).The interpretation of this and further evidence is still quite contested, and the main argument in favour of Insular Celtic is connected with the development of the verbal morphology and the syntax in Irish and British Celtic, which Schumacher regards as convincing, while he considers the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic division unimportant and treats Gallo-Brittonic as an outdated hypothesis. Stifter affirms that the Gallo-Brittonic view is "out of favour" in the scholarly community as of 2008 and the Insular Celtic hypothesis "widely accepted".When referring only to the modern Celtic languages, since no Continental Celtic language has living descendants, "Q-Celtic" is equivalent to "Goidelic" and "P-Celtic" is equivalent to "Brittonic".Within the Indo-European family, the Celtic languages have sometimes been placed with the Italic languages in a common Italo-Celtic subfamily, a hypothesis that is now largely discarded, in favour of the assumption of language contact between pre-Celtic and pre-Italic communities.How the family tree of the Celtic languages is ordered depends on which hypothesis is used:"'''Insular Celtic hypothesis'''"* Proto-Celtic** Celtiberian (Continental Celtic)** Gaulish (Continental Celtic)** Insular Celtic*** Brittonic*** Goidelic"'''P-Celtic hypothesis'''"* Proto-Celtic** Celtiberian (Q-Celtic)** Goidelic (Q-Celtic)** P-Celtic*** Gaulish*** Brittonic;/div;Eska (2010)Eska (2010)Joseph F.

Routledge. evaluates the evidence as supporting the following tree, based on shared innovations, though it is not always clear that the innovations are not areal features.  It seems likely that Celtiberian split off before Cisalpine Celtic, but the evidence for this is not robust.  On the other hand, the unity of Gaulish, Goidelic, and Brittonic is reasonably secure.  Schumacher (2004, p.86) had already cautiously considered this grouping to be likely genetic, based, among others, on the shared reformation of the sentence-initial, fully inflecting relative pronoun ''*i̯os, *i̯ā, *i̯od'' into an uninflected enclitic particle.  Eska sees Cisalpine Gaulish as more akin to Lepontic than to Transalpine Gaulish.*Celtic**Celtiberian ("Hispano-Celtic")**Nuclear Celtic?***Cisalpine Celtic: Lepontic → Cisalpine Gaulish***Transalpine–Goidelic–Brittonic (secure)****Transalpine Gaulish ("Transalpine Celtic")****Insular Celtic*****Goidelic*****BrittonicEska considers a division of Transalpine–Goidelic–Brittonic into Transalpine and Insular Celtic to be most probable because of the greater number of innovations in Insular Celtic than in P-Celtic, and because the Insular Celtic languages were probably not in great enough contact for those innovations to spread as part of a sprachbund.  However, if they have another explanation (such as an SOV substratum language), then it is possible that P-Celtic is a valid clade, and the top branching would be:*Transalpine–Goidelic–Brittonic (P-Celtic hypothesis)**Goidelic**Gallo-Brittonic***Transalpine Gaulish ("Transalpine Celtic")***BrittonicCharacteristicsAlthough there are many differences between the individual Celtic languages, they do show many family resemblances.* consonant mutations (Insular Celtic only)* inflected prepositions (Insular Celtic only)* two grammatical genders (modern Insular Celtic only; Old Irish and the Continental languages had three genders)* a vigesimal number system (counting by twenties)** Cornish ''hwetek ha dew ugens'' "fifty-six" (literally "sixteen and two twenty")* verb–subject–object (VSO) word order (probably Insular Celtic only)* an interplay between the subjunctive, future, imperfect, and habitual, to the point that some tenses and moods have ousted others* an impersonal or autonomous verb form serving as a passive or intransitive** Welsh ''dysgaf'' "I teach" vs. ''dysgir'' "is taught, one teaches"** Irish ''múinim'' "I teach" vs. ''múintear'' "is taught, one teaches"* no infinitives, replaced by a quasi-nominal verb form called the verbal noun or verbnoun* frequent use of vowel mutation as a morphological device, e.g. formation of plurals, verbal stems, etc.* use of preverbal particles to signal either subordination or illocutionary force of the following clause** mutation-distinguished subordinators/relativisers** particles for negation, interrogation, and occasionally for affirmative declarations* infixed pronouns positioned between particles and verbs* lack of simple verb for the imperfective "have" process, with possession conveyed by a composite structure, usually BE + preposition** Cornish ''yma kath dhymm'' "I have a cat", literally "there is a cat to me"* use of periphrastic constructions to express verbal tense, voice, or aspectual distinctions* distinction by function of the two versions of BE verbs traditionally labelled substantive (or existential) and copula* bifurcated demonstrative structure* suffixed pronominal supplements, called confirming or supplementary pronouns* use of singulars and/or special forms of counted nouns, and use of a singulative suffix to make singular forms from plurals, where older singulars have disappearedExamples:(Irish) ''Ná bac le mac an bhacaigh is ní bhacfaidh mac an bhacaigh leat.''(Literal translation) Don't bother with son the beggar's and not will-bother son the beggar's with-you.* ''bhacaigh'' is the genitive of ''bacach''.
