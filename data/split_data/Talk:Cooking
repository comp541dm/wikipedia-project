cookingFireless cookerIs there an article on the [Fireless cooker], under a different name? I couldn't find one... it's basically an insulated basket or box for keeping food at a high temperature to finish cooking, while using less fuel (and creating less pollution) than usual cooking methods. If an article is to be created here, I think it should be placed in :Category:Cooking appliances, :Category:Appropriate technology and :Category:Sustainable technologies. --Singkong2005 talk;02:09, 13 September 2006 (UTC):This looks like a variation on haybox cooking, which is a form of retained-heat cooking, combined with a form of Slow cooker. --Coconino 10:14, 20 March 2007 (UTC)Wikicook bookDo any of you think there should be a Wikicook book?

In other words, at what point (besides after the discovery of fire) did the human race feel the need to heat their foods? JezSmitty (talk) 11:51, 18 November 2007 (UTC):: Agreed. I would also like some archaeologists to weigh in on the claim of "systematic production of flint blades, the '''habitual use of fire''', evidence of hunting, cutting and sharing of animal meat, mining raw materials to produce flint tools from subsurface sources," etc. at the Qesem Cave, a site 400k to 200k years old.:: However, it's not outside the realm of possibility that humans were not the first hominins to cook.:: [Human remains spark spat], Nature (2010):: , Live Science (2014)  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/99.118.9.187|99.118.9.187 (talk) 05:33, 28 January 2014 (UTC);; ;;Food safety(since nobody responded to my previous comment about this).

Velela (talk) 13:24, 15 February 2008 (UTC)Split into food heating and food preparationI think this article should be made a disambiguation page to the following articles:*food heating*food preparation (generally)Some sources define cooking as both , some as food preparation  and some as food heating onlyAs it is not the article is a confusing mix of them both. The "Fat"-section for instance doesn't mention the heating effect on fats, but only deals with general preparation. User:Mikael Häggström|Mikael Häggström (User talk:Mikael Häggström|talk) 13:11, 2 May 2008 (UTC): This is a more complex problem, since some languages and dialects consider "cooking" to be any kind of food preparation (the Germans cook coffee, for example), and others consider it only to be food preparation that involves heat (see Levi Strauss' culinary triangle).: I would propose creating a new page called "food preparation" that encompasses all preparation forms (with many, many, links to other pages), and leaving this one to the heat methods.

I can cite another scientific study, as an example, to show that cooking actually reduces the digestibility of meats:-Loki0115 (talk) 12:08, 4 January 2009 (UTC)Vitamins and MineralsI have remove the paragraph "Vitamins from fresh vegetables and fruit may be destroyed or eluted by cooking and the greatest benefit is derived from uncooked material. Vitamin C is especially prone to oxidation during cooking and may be completely destroyed by protracted coking. Minerals may also be eluted by extended boiling." As stating that uncooked food better needs a citation given the content preceding it and the destruction of micronutriants is already mentioned and I see no reason why vitamin C needs any special treatment in this section.

I came to the article to find out whether if food is burnt, this causes cancer, or other deseases. So At that point I dont know what acrylamide is yet. And the section on raw foodism first of all, doesn't say anything about burnt food, but food cooking in general. and second. this is not where people will look, if they want to find out whether burnt food is dangerous. This is not a section where this should be discussed, or at least it should be very clearly stated, and the word "burnt" should be explicitly used. Even still, there is nothing in the section that clearly adresses the question of whether burnt food specifically is dangerous. Also you can't put that section in the acrylamide page, because people don't know what acrylamide is until they read that it is caused by burning food (I don't know if it does, but IF it does...).--CoincidentalBystander (talk) 10:34, 20 May 2010 (UTC):::I completely disagree, mostly because the food doesn't have to be "burnt" for the compound to appear.
