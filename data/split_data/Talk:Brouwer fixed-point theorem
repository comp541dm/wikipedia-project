Oleg Alexandrov 22:44, 22 September 2005 (UTC)Hex in multiple dimensions?The article says::A quite different proof can be given based on the game of Hex.  The basic theorem about Hex is that no game can end in a draw.  This is equivalent to the Brouwer fixed point theorem for dimension 2.  By considering ''n''-dimensional versions of Hex, one can prove that in general that Brouwer's theorem is equivalent to the "no draw" theorem for Hex.But how does one play an "''n''-dimensional version of Hex"?:Consider the original 2D hexboard as being made from a lattice, where one connects the lower left corner of a square of a lattice to the upper right corner with an edge.  These added diagonals make it so you can have 6 neighbors instead of 4 (on the original lattice).  It's easy to see how to cut out an n by n Hex board from this modified lattice.  In general, to create an n x n .... x n board, consider a lattice in R^m (where m is the number of dimensions of the board) and then in each m-dimensional cube add a diagonal.  Then cut out a board as in 2D.:Each player has an opposite pair of sides as before, but now some sides belong to neither player.  The game is played the same way as before.  It doesn't appear to be so interesting to play, but people have devised other higher dimensional versions which are probably more fun and interesting mathematically.  In any case, in the version I described, there can never be a draw, and this no-draw result is equivalent to the Brouwer fixed point theorem.  --C S (Talk) 07:03, 15 January 2006 (UTC)::Does the number of players remain 2? What exactly is the object on these higher dimensional grids? For example, in 3 dimensions, a "side" refers to a 2-dimensional face of the lattice, yes? If the object for both sides is to connect any point on one of your border faces with a point on the opposite border face via a continuous path, then the blocking nature of the game disappears, since both sides can achieve their object without having to block the other. If the lattice were filled with stones, most likely there would be multiple winning paths for both sides, which would be an illegal position, inasmuch as the game ends the moment either side achieves the objective. It may well be the case that a draw is impossible, but is this truly all you need to prove BFPT?::Maybe the object on a 3D grid needs to be as follows: One player need only construct a path connecting his opposite faces as described, but the other player must '''block all possible paths by the opponent''', by building a membrane which stretches through the grid, connecting an entire path which crosses one of his border faces to a path across his other border face, with no holes. Of course this is an unfair game, but now it is impossible for both sides to achieve a winning path on a filled grid.--Twixter (talk) 00:56, 13 July 2012 (UTC)elemantary proof with stokes' theoremfirst, the retraction is given by:Illustration of the retraction: F(x):=x + \left( \sqrt{1-|x|^2 + \left\langle x,\frac{x-f(x)}{|x-f(x)|} \right\rangle^2 } - \left\langle x, \frac{x-f(x)}{|x-f(x)|} \right\rangle \right) \frac{x-f(x)}{|x-f(x)|}and it can be proved using the strokes' theorem for differential forms.for \omega^{n-1}:= F^1\, dF^2\wedge\cdots\wedge dF^n , d\omega^{n-1} = 0, so you get:0 = \int_{D^n} \mathrm d\omega^{n-1} = \int_{S^{n-1}} \omega^{n-1} =  \int_{S^{n-1}} x_1 dx^2 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^n = vol (D^n) \neq 0 . first = because the jacobian is 0 by theorem of implicit functions.See the german page as example. this could be integrated. ~ibotty:: Looks a bit messy to me.... Oleg Alexandrov (talk) 16:24, 9 February 2006 (UTC):It's not that messy!  Don't be scared by the symbols, Oleg :-)  I think with a little reworking it would make a fine addition.  This is a pretty famous proof.  Unfortunately, I take a bit of an issue with "elementary" describing this proof.  The proof, as given, only proves Brouwer's theorem for sufficiently smooth maps f, since one needs to take the exterior derivative.  Luckily, we can ''homotope'' f to be smooth while still keeping the map fixed point free (we can pick a straight-line homotopy that moves every point less than epsilon, where epsilon is smaller than the minimal distance between x and f(x)); however, this is not so trivial to show and can be regarded as a technicality that makes the entire proof not as elementary.  And of course, we could debate, if we wished, whether this whole business of Stoke's theorem and smoothing maps is really more elementary than some simple homology (or homotopy) theory.  Personally, I think the only kind of proof of Brouwer that really qualifies as elementary are the ones involving some form of coloring trick, e.g. Sperner's lemma or Hex.  --C S (Talk) 01:46, 2 April 2006 (UTC):Hmmm...actually I see that since I last closely perused the article, somebody has added another proof of Brouwer for smooth maps.  Per my comment right above, this is actually a proof for continuous maps also; I'll add that to the article.  --C S (Talk) 10:42, 2 April 2006 (UTC)::There has been some little discussion on math.stackexchange  about the validity of this proof. --Sean Eberhard (talk) 09:55, 12 September 2012 (UTC):::Fascinating discussion with some great insights.  Nonetheless, there is an "obvious" way, at least to a topologist.  Since we know the smooth maps have a fixed point and the continuous map can be approximated by smooth maps, just show the set of continuous maps with a fixed point is closed.  Not hard.  --C S (talk) 22:43, 8 May 2013 (UTC): Stokes theorem may well be derived from the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem, so I would be wary of using it. But I am not certian of this, as I have not read the proof. --Dark Side of the Moon 17:02, 28 August 2006 (UTC):: It's not.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/66.191.126.159|66.191.126.159 (talk) 06:20, 21 November 2007 (UTC);;; ;;Outline of ProofI believe that there's an error outline of the proof given - in particular the induced transformation from the disk to its boundary need not be a retraction (the points on the boundary need not be fixed by the transformation). At the same time this is only a small error in that it's true that there's no continuous mapping from the disk to its boundary (retraction or not).:I'm not sure what you mean.  The map described is the one that sends x to the point on the boundary given by following the directed line going from f(x) to x.  So if x is on the boundary, it gets fixed. --C S (Talk) 03:36, 1 May 2006 (UTC)Sorry, you're completely right, I thought the ray was in the other direction.:However there is still a problem, why does F(x) first have to be continuous (the above section shows that it is, but this should be in the outline). The biggest problem I see is that F : D^2 \to S^1 is not '''necessarily''' surjective! --Dark Side of the Moon 16:59, 28 August 2006 (UTC)::''F'' is necessarily surjective, as it maps every element of S^1 to itself. As for continuity, this follows from the explicit formula for ''F''(''x'') that someone has given above. --Zundark 17:57, 28 August 2006 (UTC):::I was mistaken; I had misread and thought that the point ''F(x)'' was created by moving from ''x'' towards ''f(x)'' which would cause problems. The other way, the way it is in the article, will infact work. --Dark Side of the Moon 21:10, 28 August 2006 (UTC)Non-constructiveThe history section seems to imply that the theorem does not have a constructive proof. Is there a way to formalize (and prove) this statement? AxelBoldt 05:37, 9 June 2006 (UTC):Ok, I found in  that there are in fact algorithms to approximate a fixed point. AxelBoldt 03:34, 12 June 2006 (UTC)Minor pointIt seems to me that in the "Notes" near the beginning, where it mentions that the fixed point theorem also applies to objects homeomorphic to the closed unit n-disc, the property "bounded" should be removed from the parentheses.  Of course that would be true if the homeomorphism is into some R^m, by the Heine-Borel Theorem.  But the homeomorphism need not be to some R^m; it needn't even be to a metric space.  Maybe in parentheses, instead of saying "closed, bounded," it should just say "compact." Kier07 22:56, 12 December 2006 (UTC):The homeomorphic space might not be metric, but it is compact metrizable, and in a compact metrizable space, every metric is bounded.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/66.191.126.159|66.191.126.159 (talk) 06:36, 21 November 2007 (UTC);;; ;;Induced map goes the wrong waySince the retraction maps D2 to S1, its induced map goes from ;pi;1(D2) to ;pi;1(S1) rather than the other way around.

Gillis (talk) 21:57, 24 April 2009 (UTC)::A point need not be an atom in a mathematical view of the liquid? Although maybe not the exact physical interpretation? This is what I would call a '''clarification''', which is exactly what the OP requested. That's the problem here. It's a very small problem, certainly. And most readers can probably understand the intended concept the way it is stated. Perhaps the word cocktail could be prefaced with (mathematically idealized) as a way to head off any argument about discrete molecules.

It does not -- it is an easy exercise, for instance, to construct functions of the sort indicated whose zero sets are things like the "topologist's sine curve", which definitely does not contain a line!Making the "intuitive proof" precise is actually quite difficult.  One would need to know something about dimension theory, but the usual proofs of the basic facts in dimension theory needed to prove the needed results actually use Brouwer's fixed point theorem!

And, as I understand Brouwer eventually knew a refutation of it, and renounced his own theorem. What we have proofs of is constructive substitutes: there is a fixed point up to epsilon, but this does not always give an exact fixed point because the approximations do not always converge as epsilon goes to zero.  --Special:Contributions/99.245.206.188|99.245.206.188 (talk) 03:32, 21 January 2010 (UTC)  (PS: why does an article on Brouwer's fixed point theorem start with a picture of Poincaré?)Generalization for compact connected ordersUnder "Generalizations" it is stated that if L is a compact, connected order topology, then any continuous function from L^n to itself has a fixed point, but there is no reference given.

There will always be a "You are Here" point on the map which represents that same point in the country." A country is not necessarily convex (can you name one that is?), which is required in the Brouwer's fixed-point theorem, so I don't see how this is an illustration of the theorem.
