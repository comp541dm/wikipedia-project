Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA)I'd like to know why the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) is not mentioned in this article. It has been characterized as a "major welfare reform". President Bill Clinton signed PRWORA into law in 1996. Earlier (in the 1992 presidency campaign) he has promised to "end welfare as we have come to know it", which was fulfilled by this act. It makes me wonder why the PRWORA is not mentioned because it led to a major change in society, and there is still debate in the media and the public about this act.

Does the mere oddness of the number 311 make it unlikely....  Was it unlikely that Clinton registered for the draft....  Or was it unlikely that Clinton received a high number?  No, those who had birthdays drawn as numbers 1 to 310 would be '''more''' likely to be drafted before him.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/144.183.224.2|144.183.224.2 (talk) 22:59, 29 January 2016 (UTC);;; ;;:Good catch.
