Alexander (Aetolian general)'''Alexander Aetolus''' () was a Greek poet and grammarian, the only known representative of Aetolian poetry.LifeHe was the son of Satyrus and Stratocleia, and was a native of Pleuron in Aetolia, although he spent the greater part of his life at Alexandria, where he was reckoned one of the seven tragic poets who constituted the Tragic Pleiad.Suda, ''s. v.''Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' ii. 22. § 7Scholiast, ''ad Hom ''Il. xvi. 2331911He flourished about 280 BC, in the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus.He had an office in the Library of Alexandria, and was commissioned by Ptolemy to make a collection of all the tragedies and satyric dramas that were extant.He spent some time, together with Antagoras and Aratus, at the court of Antigonus II Gonatas.Aratus, ''Phaenomena et Diosem.'' ii. pp. 431, 443, ;c. 446, ed. Buhle 1911Notwithstanding the distinction he enjoyed as a tragic poet, he appears to have had greater merit as a writer of epic poems, elegies, epigrams, and cynaedi.  Among his epic poems, we possess the titles and some fragments of three pieces: the ''Fisherman'',, Athenaeus, vii. p. 296 ''Kirka'' or ''Krika'',Athenaeus, vii. p. 283 which, however, is designated by Athenaeus as doubtful, and ''Helena'',August Immanuel Bekker, ''Anecdota Graeca'' p. 96  Of his elegies, some beautiful fragments are still extant.Athenaeus, iv. p. 170, xi. p. 496, xv. p. 899Strabo, xii. p. 556, xiv. p. 681John Tzetzes, ''ad.
