Historically, Ajax (named after the legendary Greek hero) is the most successful club in the Netherlands, with 33 Eredivisie titles and 18 KNVB Cups. It has continuously played in the Eredivisie, the Dutch football top division, since its inception in 1956 and, along with Feyenoord and PSV Eindhoven, it is one of the country's "big three" clubs that have dominated that competition.Ajax is historically one of the most successful clubs in the world; according to the International Federation of Football History ; Statistics|IFFHS, Ajax were the seventh-most successful European club of the 20th century.

The club achieved promotion to the highest level of Dutch football in 1911 and had its first major success in 1917, winning the KNVB Beker, the Netherlands' national cup. The 1917–18 Netherlands Football League Championship|following season, Ajax became national champion for the first time. The club defended its title in 1918–19 Netherlands Football League Championship|1918–19, becoming the only team to achieve an unbeaten season in the Netherlands Football League Championship.Throughout the 1920s, Ajax was a strong regional power, winning the Eerste Klasse West division in 1921, 1927 and 1928, but could not maintain its success at national level. This changed in the 1930s, with the club winning five national championships (1930–31 Netherlands Football League Championship|1931, 1931–32 Netherlands Football League Championship|1932, 1933–34 Netherlands Football League Championship|1934, 1936–37 Netherlands Football League Championship|1937, 1938–39 Netherlands Football League Championship|1939), making it the most successful Dutch team of the decade. Ajax won its second KNVB Cup in 1942–43, and an eighth Dutch title in 1946–47 Netherlands Football League Championship|1946–47, the last season the club was managed by Englishman Jack Reynolds, who, up to this point, had overseen all of its national championship successes as well as its 1917 KNVB Cup win.In 1956, the 1956–57 Eredivisie|first season of the Netherlands' new professional league, the Eredivisie, was played with Ajax participating as a founding member. The Amsterdam club became the first national champions under the new format and made its debut in the European Champion Clubs' Cup the 1957–58 European Cup|following year, losing to Hungarian champions Vasas SC 6–2 on aggregate at the quarter-final stage. The team were again Eredivisie champions in 1959–60 Eredivisie|1960 and won a third KNVB Cup in 1961.File:Cruijff afscheidswedstrijd bij Ajax.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Johan Cruijff played at Ajax from 1959 to 1973, and from 1981 to 1983, winning 3 European Cups; his No. 14 is the only squad number Ajax has ever retired. Cruyff came back to manage the club from 1985 to 1988.File:1971 Champions League Final Ajax - Panathinaikos.jpg|thumb|Against Panathinaikos in the 1971 European Cup FinalIn 1965, Rinus Michels, who had played for the club between 1946 and 1958, was appointed manager of Ajax, implementing his philosophy of Total Football which was to become synonymous with both Ajax and the Netherlands national football team. A year earlier, Johan Cruijff, who would go on to become the greatest Dutch footballer of all time, made his debut. Between them, Michels and Cruijff led Ajax through the most successful period in its history, winning seven Eredivisie titles, four KNVB Cups and three European Cups.Ajax won the Dutch championship in 1965–66 Eredivisie|1966, 1966–67 Eredivisie|1967, and 1967–68 Eredivisie|1968, and reached the 1969 European Cup Final, losing to A.C. Milan. During the 1966–67 season, Ajax scored a record 122 goals in an Eredivisie season and also won the KNVB Cup to achieve its first league and cup double. In 1969–70 Eredivisie|1969–70, Ajax won a fourth Dutch league championship and second league and cup double in five seasons, winning 27 out of 34 league games and scoring 100 goals.The 1970–71 Eredivisie|1970–71 season saw Ajax retain the 1970–71 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup and reach the 1971 European Cup Final, where they beat Panathinaikos 2–0 with goals from Dick van Dijk and Arie Haan to become continental champions for the first time, with Cruijff being named Ballon d'Or (1956–2009)|European Footballer of the Year. After this success, Michels departed to become manager of FC Barcelona and was replaced by the Romanian Ștefan Kovács. In Kovács' first season, Ajax completed a treble of the 1971–72 European Cup|European Cup, the 1971–72 Eredivisie|Eredivisie and a third consecutive 1971–72 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup. The following season, the team beat Argentine club Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente to win the 1972 Intercontinental Cup and retained their 1972–73 Eredivisie|Eredivisie and 1972–73 European Cup|European Cup titles, becoming the first club to win three consecutive European Cups since Real Madrid in the 1950s.In 1973, Michels' Barcelona broke the world transfer record to bring Cruijff to Catalonia. Kovács also departed to become manager of the France national football team signalling the end of this period of international success.In 1976–77 Eredivisie|1976–77, Ajax won its first domestic championship in four seasons and recorded a double of the 1977–78 Eredivisie|Eredivisie and 1977–78 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup two years later.The early 1980s saw the return of Johan Cruijff to the club, as well as the emergence of young players Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard. The team won back-to-back Eredivisie titles in 1981–82 Eredivisie|1982 and 1982–83 Eredivisie|1983, with all three playing a significant role in the latter. After Cruijff's sale to rivals Feyenoord in 1983, Van Basten became Ajax's key player, top scoring in the Eredivisie for four seasons between 1983–84 Eredivisie|1983–84 and 1986–87 Eredivisie|1986–87.In 1985, Cruijff returned to Ajax as manager and the team ended 1985–86 Eredivisie|his first season in charge with 120 goals from 34 matches. However, Ajax still finished as runner up to PSV by eight points. The following season, Ajax again lost out on the 1986–87 Eredivisie|Eredivisie title to PSV, but won the 1986–87 European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup, its first continental trophy in fourteen years. After this, Cruijff left the club to become manager of Barcelona and Rijkaard and Van Basten were sold to Sporting CP and A.C. Milan respectively. Despite these losses, Ajax reached a second consecutive Cup Winners' Cup final in 1988, where they lost to Belgian club KV Mechelen.The 1988–89 Eredivisie|1988–89 season saw Dennis Bergkamp, a young forward who had first appeared under Cruijff in 1986, establish himself as a regular goalscorer for Ajax. Bergkamp helped Ajax to the 1989–90 Eredivisie title and was the top scorer in the division in 1990–91 Eredivisie|1990–91, 1991–92 Eredivisie|1991–92 and 1992–93 Eredivisie|1992–93. Under the management of Louis van Gaal, Ajax won the UEFA Cup in 1991–92 UEFA Cup|1992 to become the second club, after Juventus, to have won all three major European club competitions.After the sale of Bergkamp to Internazionale in 1993, Van Gaal re-signed the experienced Frank Rijkaard to complement his young Ajax team featuring academy graduates Frank and Ronald de Boer, Edwin van der Sar, Clarence Seedorf, Edgar Davids, Michael Reiziger, and Winston Bogarde, as well as mercurial foreign talents Finidi George, Nwankwo Kanu and Jari Litmanen, and veteran captain Danny Blind. The team regained the Dutch championship in 1993–94 Eredivisie|1993–94, and won it again in 1994–95 Eredivisie|1994–95 and 1995–96 Eredivisie|1995–96 to become the first Ajax side to win three back-to-back championships since 1968. The height of Van Gaal's success came in 1994–95, where Ajax became the first, and to date only, team to complete an entire Eredivisie season unbeaten. The team also won its first European Cup since its glorious 1970s era, beating Milan in the 1995 UEFA Champions League Final 1–0, with the winning goal scored by 18-year-old Patrick Kluivert. Ajax again reached the final a year later but were defeated on penalties by Juventus.Ajax's return as a European force was short lived as Van Gaal and several members of the squad soon departed to some of the continent's biggest clubs. The 2000s was a lean decade for the club with only two Eredivisie championships won. However, Ajax's academy continued to produce star players such as Wesley Sneijder and Rafael van der Vaart.In 2010, Frank de Boer was appointed manager of Ajax and led the club to its first league title in seven years, and record 30th title overall, in the 2010–11 Eredivisie|2010–11 season. This was followed by back-to-back wins in 2011–12 Eredivisie|2011–12 and 2012–13 Eredivisie|2012–13 to match his three consecutive titles as a player in the 1990s. In 2013–14 Eredivisie|2013–14, Ajax were again Eredivisie champions, winning four consecutive league titles for the first time in the club's history.UEFA rankingUEFA coefficient5 November 2015{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"|-!

Dutch national first-team players Rafael van der Vaart, Ryan Babel, Wesley Sneijder, Maarten Stekelenburg, Eljero Elia, André Ooijer, John Heitinga and Nigel de Jong had also came through the ranks at Ajax and all are now playing for top-flight clubs. Ajax also regularly supplies the Dutch national youth teams with local talent. First team regulars Siem de Jong, Urby Emanuelson and Gregory van der Wiel are former youth internationals who made the successful step up to the senior side.Due to mutual agreements with foreign clubs, the youth academy has also signed foreign players as teenagers before making first team debuts, such as Belgian defensive trio Jan Vertonghen, Toby Alderweireld and Thomas Vermaelen along with winger Tom de Mul, all of whom are full internationals as well as Dutch international Vurnon Anita as well as Javier Martina from Curaçao.Ajax has also expanded its talent searching program to South Africa with Ajax Cape Town. Ajax Cape Town was set up with the help of Rob Moore. Ajax has also had a satellite club in the United States under the name Ajax America, until it filed for bankruptcy. There are some youth players from Ajax Cape Town that have been drafted into the Eredivisie squad, such as South African internationals Steven Pienaar, Thulani Serero and Cameroonian international Eyong Enoh.In 1995, the year Ajax won the Champions League, the Dutch national team was almost entirely composed of Ajax players, with Edwin van der Sar in goal; players such as Michael Reiziger, Frank de Boer, and Danny Blind in defense; Ronald de Boer, Edgar Davids, and Clarence Seedorf in midfield; and Patrick Kluivert and Marc Overmars in attack.In 2011 AFC Ajax opened its first youth academies outside the Netherlands, when the club partnered up with George Kazianis and All Star Consultancy in Greece to open the Ajax Hellas Youth Academy. The offices are based in Nea Smyrni, Attica, with the main training facility located on the island of Corfu, hosting a total of 15 football youth academies throughout Greece and Cyprus. Eddie van Schaik heads the organization as coach and consultant, introducing the Ajax football philosophy at the various Greek football training camps.StadiumsStadiums of AFC AjaxAjax' first stadium was built in 1911 out of wood and was called "Het Houten Stadion" (The Wooden Stadium). Ajax later played in the stadium built for the 1928 Summer Olympics hosted in Amsterdam. This stadium, designed by Jan Wils, is known as the Olympic Stadium. In 1934, Ajax moved to De Meer Stadion in east Amsterdam, designed by architect and Ajax-member Daan Roodenburgh, who had also designed the club's first stadium. It could accommodate 29,500 spectators and Ajax continued to play there until 1996. For big European and national fixtures the club would often play at the Olympic Stadium, which could accommodate about twice the number of spectators.File:Amsterdam Arena Aerial.jpg|thumb|Exterior of the Amsterdam ArenAIn 1996, Ajax moved to a new home ground in the southeast of the city known as the Amsterdam ArenA This was built by the Amsterdam city authority at a cost of $134 million. The stadium is capable of holding approximately 52,000 people. The average attendance in 2006/07 was 48,610, rising in the next season to 49,128. The ArenA has a retractable roof and set a trend for other modern stadiums built in Europe in the following years. In the Netherlands, the ArenA has earned a reputation for a terrible grass pitch caused by the removable roof that, even when open, takes away too much sunlight and fresh air. During the 2008–2009 season ground staff introduced an artificial lighting system that has finally reduced this problem considerably.The much-loved De Meer stadium was torn down and the land was sold to the city council. A residential neighbourhood now occupies the area. The only thing left of the old stadium are the letters AJAX, nowadays in place on the façade of the youth training grounds De Toekomst, near the Amsterdam Arena.Crest and coloursCrestIn 1900, when the club was founded, the emblem of Ajax was just a picture of an Ajax player. The crest was slightly altered following the club's promotion to the top division in 1911 to match the club's new outfits. In 1928, the club logo was introduced with the head of the Greek hero Ajax. The logo was once again changed in 1990 into an abstract version of the previous one. The new logo still sports the portrait of Ajax, but drawn with just 11 lines, symbolizing the 11 players of a football team.{||-|File:Ajax Amsterdam (1900–1928).gif|thumbnail|130px|The first Ajax crest;br(1900–1911);/center;||File:Ajax Amsterdam (1911–1928).jpeg|thumbnail|130px|The second crest;br(1911–1928);/center;||File:Ajax Amsterdam (1928–1990).png|130px|thumbnail|The third crest;br(1928–1990);/center;||File:Ajax Amsterdam.svg|130px|thumbnail|The current crest;br(1990–present);/center;|};/center;ColorsAjax originally played in an all-black uniform with a red sash tied around the players' waists, but that uniform was soon replaced by a red/white striped shirt and black shorts. Red, black and white are the three colours of the flag of Amsterdam. However, when, under manager Jack Kirwan, the club got promoted to the top flight of Dutch football for the first time in 1911 (then the ''Eerste Klasse'' or 'First Class', later named the Eredivisie), Ajax were forced to change their colours because Sparta Rotterdam already had exactly the same outfit. Special kits for away fixtures did not exist at the time and according to football association regulations the newcomers had to change their colours if two teams in the same league had identical uniforms. Ajax opted for white shorts and white shirt with a broad, vertical red stripe over chest and back, which still is Ajax's outfit.FinancialAFC Ajax N.V.AFC Ajax N.V.AFC Ajax are the only Dutch club with an Initial public offering (IPO). The club is registered as a Naamloze vennootschap (N.V.) listed on the stock exchange Euronext Amsterdam, since 17 May 1998. With a launch price of ƒ25,- (Guilders) the club managed to a bring their total revenue up to €54 million euros (converted) in their first year on the market. After short lived success however the rate dropped, at one point as low as €3,50. Criticism was brought forth that the legal grid for a naamloze vennootschap would not be suitable for a Football club, and that the sports related ambitions would suffer from the new commercial interests of the now listed Ajax. Shares of the company in the year 2008 were valued at approximately €5,90 per share., Yahoo.comIn 2008 a Commission under guidance of honorary member Uri Coronel concluded, that the IPO was of no value to the club, and that measures should be taken to exit the stock exchange by purchasing back all public shares., De Pers, 1 juli 2008 Ajax remain on the stock exchange.Sponsorship2011 AFC Ajax team wearing their home kit by adidas with the AEGON sponsor across the chest, ahead of their UEFA Champions League match against Olympique Lyonnais.Ajax's shirts have been sponsored by TDK from 1982 to 1991, and by ABN AMRO from 1991 to 2008. AEGON then replaced ABN AMRO as the new head sponsor for a period of seven years. On 1 April 2007, Ajax wore a different sponsor for the match against Heracles Almelo: ''Florius''. Florius is a banking program launched by ABN AMRO who wanted it to be the shirt sponsor for one match.The shirts have been manufactured by Le Coq Sportif (1973–1977), Puma (1977–1980), Le Coq Sportif (1980–1984), Kappa (1985-1989) and Umbro (1989–2000) in the past, and by Adidas since 2000 (until at least 2019).In conclusion of the 2013–14 AFC Ajax season|2013–14 season, Ajax won the Football shirt of the Year award for their black and rose colored away shirt by adidas. An annual award presented by Subside Sports which had previously been won by Internazionale, Juventus and the Belgium national team.

The team is composed mostly of professional footballers, who are often recent graduates from the highest youth level (Ajax A1) serving their first professional contract as a reserve, or players who are otherwise unable to play in the first team.Since 1992 Jong Ajax have competed in the Beloften Eredivisie, competing against other reserve teams such as Jong PSV, Jong FC Groningen or Jong AZ. They have won the Beloften Eredivisie title a record eight times, as well as the KNVB Reserve Cup three times, making them the most successful reserve squad in the Netherlands. By winning the Beloften Eredivisie title, Jong Ajax were able to qualify for the actual KNVB Cup, even advancing to the semi-finals on three occasions. Their best result in the Dutch Cup was under manager Jan Olde Riekerink in 2001-02, when a semi-final loss to FC Utrecht in a Penalty shoot-out after extra time, which saw Utrecht advance, and thus preventing an Ajax vs. Jong Ajax Dutch Cup final.The 2013–14 season marked the Jupiler League debut of the AFC Ajax reserves' squad Jong Ajax. Previously playing in the Beloften Eredivisie (a separate league for reserve teams, not included in the Dutch professional or amateur league structure) players were allowed to move around freely between the reserve team and the first team during the season. This is no longer the case as Jong Ajax now registers and fields a separate squad from that of Ajax first team for the Eerste Divisie, the second tier of professional football in the Netherlands. Their home matches are played at Sportpark De Toekomst, except for the occasional match in the Amsterdam Arena. Now regarded a semi-professional team in their own respect, the only period in which players are able to move between squads are during the transfer windows, unless the player has made less than 15 appearances for the first team, then he is still eligible to appear in both first team and second team matches during the season. Furthermore, the team is not eligible for promotion to the Eredivisie or to participate in the KNVB Cup. Jong Ajax were joined in the Eerste Divisie by Jong Twente and Jong PSV, reserve teams who have also moved from the Beloften Eredivisie to the Eerste Divisie, in place of VV Katwijk, SC Veendam and AGOVV Apeldoorn, increasing the total amount of teams in the Jupiler League from 18 to 20.Ajax reserve squad Jong Ajax left the Beloften Eredivisie in 2013, having held a 21-year tenure in the reserves league, having also won the league title a record eight times. (1994, 1996, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2009)Amateur teamAFC Ajax (amateurs)AFC Ajax Amateurs, better known as '''Ajax Zaterdag''' is a Dutch amateur football club founded 18 March 1900. It is the amateur team of the professional club AFC Ajax, who play their home matches at the Sportpark De Toekomst training grounds to a capacity of 5,000.

The team has won the Eerste Klasse title twice, as well as the *KNVB District Cup West I on two occasions as well.Furthermore, Ajax Zaterdag have also managed to qualify for the KNVB Cup on their own accord on three occasions, namely in 2004, 2005 and in 2008, even advancing to the second round before bowing out to Vitesse on 24 September 2008 during their last appearance in the cup tournament.Women's teamAFC Ajax (women)AFC Ajax Vrouwen (''English: AFC Ajax Women'') are the women's team of AFC Ajax, competing in the BeNe League, the highest level of professional football in Belgium and the Netherlands.

The team won their first piece of silverware when the defeated PSV/FC Eindhoven 2–1 in the final of the KNVB Women's Cup.Other sportsBaseball teamAjax HVAAjax HVA (1922–1972) was the baseball team of AFC Ajax founded in 1922, and competing as founding members of the Honkbal Hoofdklasse, the top flight of professional baseball in the Netherlands. Ajax won the national baseball title a total of four times (1924, 1928, 1942, 1948) before the club opted to no longer field a baseball team, and to focus solely on football in 1972. Ajax spent a total of 50 years at the top flight of Baseball in the Netherlands from 1922 to 1972. The dissolution of Ajax baseball club resulted in the players finding a new sponsor in a mustard manufacturing company called Luycks, while merging with the Diemen Giants to become the Luycks Giants, thus replacing both former clubs.Affiliated clubsList of AFC Ajax affiliated clubsThe following clubs are currently affiliated with AFC Ajax:* South Africa Ajax Cape Town (1999–present)* Netherlands Almere City (2005–present)* Spain Barcelona (2007–present)* Brazil Cruzeiro (2007–present)* People's Republic of China Beijing Guoan (2007–present)* Brazil Palmeiras (2010–present)* Slovakia AS Trenčín (2012–present)* Netherlands ''Various HETT-clubs (See main article)''The following clubs were affiliated with AFC Ajax in the past:* Belgium Germinal Beerschot (1999–2003)* Ghana Ashanti Goldfields (1999–2003)* United States Ajax Orlando Prospects (2003–2007)* Netherlands HFC Haarlem (2006–2010)* Netherlands FC Volendam (2007–2010)Rivalries''As one of the traditional big three clubs in the Netherlands, Ajax have amassed a number of intense rivalries over the years. Listed below are the most significant of the rivalries involving Ajax Amsterdam.''Rivalry with FeyenoordDe KlassiekerFeyenoord from Rotterdam are Ajax's arch rivals. Every year both clubs play the "De Klassieker" ("The Classic"), a match between the teams from the two largest cities of the Netherlands.  During the seventies, Ajax and Feyenoord were the only two clubs in the Netherlands who were able to clinch national titles, as well as achieve continental and even global success.  A meeting between the two clubs became the measure for who was truly the best club in the Netherlands. The Klassieker is the most famous of all the rivalries in the Netherlands and the matches are always sold out.  The fixture is seen in the public eye as "''The graceful and elegant football of Ajax, against the indomitable fighting spirit of Feyenoord''". The confidence of the Capital versus the Blue collar mentality of Rotterdam. Matches are known for their tension and violence, both on and off the pitch. Over the years several violent incidents have taken place involving rival supporters, leading to the current prohibition of away-supporters in both stadiums. The lowest point was reached on 23 March 1997, when supporters of both clubs meet on a field near Beverwijk, where Ajax-supporter Carlo Picornie was fatally injured, the incident is commonly referred to as the "Battle of Beverwijk".Rivalry with PSVPSV are also a rival of Ajax, but in terms of tension and rivalry, these matches are not as loaded as the duels with Feyenoord. The rivalry has existed for some time with PSV and stems from various causes, such as the different interpretations of whether current national and international successes of both clubs correlates and the supposed opposition between the Randstad and the province. The matches between these two teams is commonly referred to as "De Topper" ("The Topper"), and involves the two most trophy-laden sides in Dutch football and is essentially a clash of two competing schools of thought in Dutch football. Historically PSV compete with a workmanlike ethic, preferring a more robust 4-3-1-2 or 4-2-3-1, typically shunning the seductive 4-3-3 approach favoured in Amsterdam. While Rinus Michels and Johan Cruijff helped to innovate Total Football in the sixties and seventies, a different philosophy was honed in Eindhoven by Kees Rijvers and Guus Hiddink in the late seventies and eighties. This in turn has created one of the more philosophical rivalries in football, an ideological battleground, which is gradually becoming as heated and intense as the matches Ajax and Feyenoord partake in.Rivalries with other clubsAmsterdam derbyAside from Feyenoord and PSV, Ajax have several other rivalries, although in most cases the sentiment is mostly felt by the opposition and is more directed towards Ajax, with one of them being FC Utrecht. Although the rivalry is more felt on the Utrecht side then with Ajax, matchups between the two sides are often quite intense. Both teams have fanatic supporters, and clashes off the pitch are more often the rule than the exception. The same goes for ADO Den Haag, with both supporter-groups often getting in conflicts, when ADO-Hooligans set fire to the Supporters home of Ajax, and Ajax-Hooligans subsequently broke into the Supporters home of ADO tensions between the two clubs rose. In 2006 Supporters from both clubs were banned from attending away matches for five years, due to frequent violent outbreaks and clashes.Further teams who share a rivalry with Ajax include FC Twente, FC Groningen and AZ. Although the latter are often regarded by Ajax-supporters as the club's little brother. Being from nearby Alkmaar, and with both clubs sharing the same Province, match-ups between the two sides are commonly known as the "De Noord-Hollandse Derby" ("North Holland Derby") and are often very competitive, intense and loaded fixtures.Past rivalries include local Amsterdam derbies between Ajax and clubs such as Blauw-Wit, DWS and De Volewijckers (who later merged to become FC Amsterdam in 1972). The tension between the local sides lessened however, as the division of the clubs through playing in different leagues over time became greater. Years of not competing in the same league resulted in less frequent match-ups, until tensions finally settled between the Amsterdam clubs. The last Amsterdam derby to take place in an official league match was when Ajax defeated FC Amsterdam 5-1, on 19 March 1978.SupportersVAK410SupportersAjax are known for having fanatic core supporter-groups, of which F-Side and VAK410 are the most famous. F-Side were founded on 3 October 1976, and are situated right behind the goal In the Amsterdam ArenA, on the southern end of the stadium in rows 125–129. Their name is derived from the group's former location on the F-side of the old De Meer Stadion.The F-side supporters are responsible for a big part of the atmosphere in the stadium, but are also known for rioting during and after matches. If in any match Ajax should win the coin toss, the second half of the match Ajax always play towards the south-end of the stadium.VAK410 (English: Row 410) were founded in 2001 and are situated in the Zuidhoek (''South corner'') of the stadium on the upper ring in rows 424–425. The group was originally situated on the North-West side of the stadium in row 410, from where it derives its name, until relocating to their current place in the stands in 2008. Members of VAK410 are known to perform various stunts, which include massive banners, to enhance the atmosphere in the stadium. Neither F-Side or VAK410 have seats in their sections of the stadium, and both groups stand for the duration of the match.Through the official ''Football Top 20'' of Dutch sports research group ''SPORT+MARKT'' it was revealed in 2010 that Ajax had approximately 7,1 million supporters throughout Europe. Slightly more than rivals Feyenoord and PSV (each 1,6 and 1,3 million, respectively), which put Ajax in 15th place for most supporters in all of Europe. The study also revealed that approximately 39% of the Netherlands were Ajax supporters.[Ajax wint nog meer fans, Barça populairste club] Not only does Ajax have a lot of supporters, but several fans attend their matches in European competition, with an average attendance of 48.677 spectators for every International match Ajax played, putting the team at 12th place in Europe for highest attendance, ahead of big name clubs such as Milan, Manchester City or Chelsea. It is noteworthy that not all stadiums share the capacity of the Amsterdam Arena.Supporters clubsSupportersvereniging AjaxAjax supporters celebrating the club's 30th Dutch national championshipThe Supporters Club Ajax (Supportersvereniging Ajax) is officially the largest Supporters club in the Netherlands with 94,000 members. Founded on 7 May 1992, the supporters club organize big monthly events throughout the Netherlands, and particularly around the official Ajax Open Training Day, which attracts thousands of supporters each year. Furthermore, the Supporters group is responsible for the Ajax Life website, as well as the fanzine which is issued 20 times a year. In 2006, the AFCA Supportersclub was introduced as the club's second official supporters' association, through the merger of the Onafhankelijke Fanclub Ajax (OFA) and the Ajax Supporters Delegatie (ASD). The AFCA Supportersclub has a reported 42,000 members, as well as a former member on the Board of Administration of Ajax, in Ronald Pieloor.Average attendanceThis graph displays the average attendance for home matches of Ajax from 1988–2012, whereby the difference in capacity of the De Meer Stadion and the Amsterdam ArenA (est. 1996) is clearly visible.{| Cellpadding="0" CellSpacing="1" style="font-size:100%; border:1px solid #a0a0a0; padding:1px; text-align:center;"|- valign="bottom"| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0| #C0FFC0||- align=center style="font-size:80%;"|88/89||89/90||90/91||91/92||92/93||93/94||94/95||95/96||96/97||97/98||98/99||99/00||00/01||01/02||02/03||03/04||04/05||05/06||06/07||07/08||08/09||09/10||10/11||11/12||11/12||12/13||13/14|||}Jewish connectionSupporters with Israeli flags in 2008Historically, Ajax was popularly seen as having "Jewish roots". Although not an official Jewish club like the city's WV-HEDW, Ajax has had a Jewish image since the 1930s when the home stadium was located next to a Jewish neighbourhood of Amsterdam-Oost and opponents saw many supporters walking through the Nieuwmarkt/Waterloopleinbuurt (de Jodenhoek) to get to the stadium. The city of Amsterdam was historically referred to as a Mokum city, Mokum (מקום) being the Yiddish word for "place" or "safe haven",[Yiddish Dictionary Online] and as anti-Semitic chants and name calling developed and intensified at the old De Meer Stadion from frustrated supporters of opposing clubs, Ajax fans (few of whom are actually Jewish – New York Times, 28 March 2005) responded by embracing Ajax's "Jewish" identity: calling themselves "super Jews", chanting "Jews, Jews" ("Joden, Joden") at games, and adopting Jewish symbols such as the Star of David and the Israeli flag."nyt"by Ramon Spaaij, published 2006This Jewish imagery eventually became a central part of Ajax fans' culture."understanding"At one point ringtones of "Hava Nagila", a Hebrew folk song, could be downloaded from the club's official website."nyt"Beginning in the 1980s, fans of Ajax's rivals escalated their antisemitic rhetoric, chanting slogans like "Hamas, Hamas/Jews to the gas" ("Hamas, hamas, joden aan het gas"), hissing to imitate the flow of gas, giving Nazi salutes, etc."nyt"The eventual result was that many (genuinely) Jewish Ajax fans stopped going to games."nyt"In the 2000s the club began trying to persuade fans to drop their Jewish image. In 2013 a documentary titled ''Superjews'' was released by NTR and Viewpoint Productions which premiered at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA). The film was directed by Nirit Peled, an Israeli living in Amsterdam, and an independent film maker who offers a very personal view into the game, the lore of Ajax and its relation to Judaism from both the supporters as well as from a Jewish perspective.PlayersCurrent squad1 September 2015Players out on loanRetired numbers*'''14''' – Netherlands Johan Cruyff (Forward, 1964–73, 1981–83).
