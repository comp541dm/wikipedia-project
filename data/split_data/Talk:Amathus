UntitledCorn?!?!?!?!?  I thought that was brought over from the New World.  Can someone confirm this?----In older English usage, "corn" meant any kind of grain. Most often wheat, but sometimes other grains, and sometimes non-food items of about the same size and shape as a grain of wheat. This usage was perhaps still common at the time of the 1911 encyclopedia (though i think it remained in use longer in England than North America). I think this usage is now almost dead, except that classical scholars seem to use it still. In this case we can be sure that one of the old-world grain crops is meant. Most likely some kind of wheat, but perhaps barley, millet, rye, or one of the older grain crops that is no longer grown.----The strong Phoenician sympathies bit can be interpreted by the existence of non greek population(eteocypriots), as documented by bilingual inscriptions in the cypriot syllabary found in Amathus.Mavros 19:54, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)
