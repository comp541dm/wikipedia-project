'''Barcelonnette''' () is a commune of France and a subprefecture in the department of Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region. It is located in the southern French Alps, at the crossroads between Provence, Piedmont and the Dauphiné, and is the largest town in the Ubaye Valley. The town's inhabitants are known as ''Barcelonnettes''.ToponymyBarcelonnette was founded and named in 1231, by Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence.Albert Dauzat and Charles Rostaing, ''Dictionnaire étymologique des noms de lieux en France'', Éd. Larousse, 1968, pp. 1693–1694. While the town's name is generally seen as a diminutive form of Barcelona in Catalonia, Albert Dauzat and Charles Rostaing point out an earlier attestation of the name ''Barcilona'' in Barcelonnette in around 1200, and suggest that it is derived instead from two earlier stems signifying a mountain, *''bar'' and *''cin'' (the latter of which is also seen in the name of Mont Cenis).Charles Rostaing, ''Essai sur la toponymie de la Provence (depuis les origines jusqu’aux invasions barbares'', Laffite Reprints, Marseille, 1973 (1st edition 1950), p 91Ernest Nègre, ''Toponymie générale de la France : étymologie de 35 000 noms de lieux'', Genève : Librairie Droz, 1990.

In ''Valéian'' (the dialect of Occitan spoken in the Ubaye Valley), it is called ''Barcilouna de Prouvença'' or ''Barcilounéta''.François Arnaud, Gabriel Maurin, ''Le langage de la vallée de Barcelonnette'', Paris : Champion, 1920 - Re-edited in 1973, Marseille: Laffitte ReprintsJean-Rémy Fortoul, ''Ubaye, la mémoire de mon pays : les gens, les bêtes, les choses, le temps'', Barcelonnette: Sabença de la Valeia/Mane: Alpes de Lumière, 1995.

Polybius described the Vesubians as belligerent but nonetheless civilised and mercantile, and Julius Caesar praised their bravery.''Vallis Montium : Histoire de la vallée de Barcelonnette'', p.12 and p.15'''', p. 30, le col de la Magdeleine étant l'ancien nom du col de Larche, ''Colle della Maddalena'' in Italian.'''', page 115 The work ''History of the Gauls'' also places the Vesubians in the Ubaye Valley.'''', 1754Following the Roman conquest of Provence, Barcelonnette was included in a small province with modern Embrun as its capital and governed by Albanus Bassalus. This was integrated soon afterwards into Gallia Narbonensis.''Vallis Montium : Histoire de la vallée de Barcelonnette'', p.16 In 36 AD, Emperor Nero transferred Barcelonnette to the province of the Cottian Alps. The town was known as ''Rigomagensium'' under the Roman Empire and was the capital of a civitas (a provincial subdivision),Raymond Collier, ''La Haute-Provence monumentale et artistique'', Digne, Imprimerie Louis Jean, 1986, p. 15 though no Roman money has yet been found in the canton of Barcelonnette.Raymond Collier, ''La Haute-Provence monumentale et artistique'', p. 37Medieval townThe town of Barcelonnette was founded in 1231 by Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence. According to Charles Rostaing, this act of formal "foundation", according certain privileges to the town, was a means of regenerating the destroyed town of ''Barcilona''."Rostaing"The town was afforded a ''consulat'' (giving it the power to administer and defend itself) in 1240.Under the direction of Édouard Baratier, Georges Duby, and Ernest Hildesheimer, ''Atlas historique. Provence, Comtat Venaissin, principauté d’Orange, comté de Nice, principauté de Monaco'', Librairie Armand Colin, Paris, 1969, p. 163Control of the area in the Middle Ages swung between the Counts of Savoy and of Provence. In 1388, after Count Louis II of Provence had left to conquer Naples, the Count of Savoy Amadeus VIII took control of Barcelonnette; however, it returned to Provençal control in 1390, with the d'Audiffret family as its lords. On the death of Louis II in 1417 it reverted to Savoy, and, although Count René of Anjou|René again retook the area for Provence in 1471, it had returned to Savoyard dominance by the start of the 16th century, by which point the County of Provence had become united with the Kingdom of France due to the death of Count Charles V in 1481.Ancien RégimeDuring Charles V's invasion of Provence in 1536, Francis I of France sent the Count of Fürstenberg's 6000 ''Landsknechte'' to ravage the area in a scorched earth policy. Barcelonnette and the Ubaye Valley remained under French sovereignty until the second Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis on 3 April 1559.In 1588 the troops of François de Bonne, Duke of Lesdiguières|François, Duke of Lesdiguières entered the town and set fire to the church and convent during their campaign against the Duke of Savoy. In 1600, after the Treaty of Vervins, conflict returned between Henry IV of France and Savoy, and Lesdiguières retook Barcelonnette until the conclusion of the Treaty of Lyon on 17 January the following year. In 1628, during the War of the Mantuan Succession, Barcelonnette and the other towns of the Ubaye Valley were pillaged and burned by Jacques du Blé d'Uxelles and his troops, as they passed through towards Italy to the Duke of Mantua's aid. The town was retaken by the Duke of Savoy in 1630; and in 1691 it was captured by the troops of the Marquis de Vins during the War of the League of Augsburg.Between 1614 and 1713, Barcelonnette was the seat of one of the four prefectures under the jurisdiction of the Senate of Nice.[Histoire d'Allos : la préfecture de Barcelonnette] At this time, the community of Barcelonnette successfully purchased the ''seigneurie'' of the town as it was put to auction by the Duke of Savoy; it thereby gained its own justicial powers."Rébellion";Jean Nicolas, ''La Rébellion française : mouvements populaires et conscience sociale, 1661-1789'', Paris: Gallimard, 2008.

Though only a minority of the population, the movement rebelled on Sunday 7 December, the day after the news of the coup arrived. Town officials and gendarmes were disarmed and placed in the maison d'arrêt. A committee of public health was created on 8 December; on 9 December the inhabitants of Jausiers and its surroundings formed a colony under the direction of general councillor Brès, and Mayor Signoret of Saint-Paul-sur-Ubaye. This was stopped, however, on 10 December before it could reach Barcelonnette, as the priest of the subprefecture had intervened. On 11 December, several officials escaped and found refuge in Maddalena Pass|L'Argentière in Piedmont. The arrival of troops on 16 December put a final end to the republican resistance without bloodshed, and 57 insurgents were tried; 38 were condemned to deportation (though several were pardoned in April).Between 1850 and 1950, Barcelonnette was the source of a wave of emigration to Mexico. Among these emigrants was Jean Baptiste Ebrard, founder of the Liverpool department store chain in Mexico; Marcelo Ebrard, the head of government of Mexico City from 2006 to 2012, is also descended from them. On the edges of Barcelonnette and Jausiers there are several houses and villas of colonial style (known as ''maisons mexicaines''), constructed by emigrants to Mexico who returned to France between 1870 and 1930. A plaque in the town commemorates the deaths of ten Mexican citizens who returned to Barcelonnette to fight in the First World War.During the Second World War, 26 Jews were arrested in Barcelonnette before being deported.AJPN, "", ''Anonymes, Justes et Persécutés durant la période nazie dans les communes de France'', accessed 25 May 2012 The 89th ''compagnie de travailleurs étrangers'' (Company of Foreign Workers), consisting of foreigners judged as undesirable by the Third Republic and the Vichy regime and committed to forced labour, was established in Barcelonnette.AJPN, "", ''Anonymes, Justes et Persécutés durant la période nazie dans les communes de France'', accessed 27 May 2012"réfugiés";Josette Lesueur, Gérard Lesueur, ''Les travailleurs espagnols en Ubaye, 1939-1940'', Barcelonnette, Sabença de la Valeia, 2010, collection "Cahiers de la Vallée", ISBN 2-908103-54-0, p. 11The 11th Battalion of ''Chasseurs alpins'' was garrisoned at Barcelonnette between 1948 and 1990.Conseil général des AHP, "Un second souffle pour l’Ubaye?", ''Le Magazine du conseil général'', no. 70 June 2009, p. 6GeographyBarcelonnette is situated in the wide and fertile Ubaye Valley, of which it is the largest town.
