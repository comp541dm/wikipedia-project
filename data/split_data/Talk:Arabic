The first paragraph1, The structure of the first sentence is: "X is the classical X language ..." There must be something wrong with defining a term using the term itself. May I suggest "The Arabic language is a classical language from ..." (or something along these lines).2, The title of the page is “Arabic language” not just “Arabic.” Surely the term “Arabic” has a wider meaning, (e.g. Arabic Culture/Architecture/Science/etc.) rather than just a language. So why not simply define the term "Arabic language"?3, The phrase: "Arabic is spoken in a wide arc" must be confusing to some. This is trying to say the language is spoken in a geographically contiguous linear region (which I admit is somewhat clumsy), but perhaps "geographic arc" would be a helpful refinement.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/94.100.23.163|94.100.23.163 (talk) 14:59, 8 July 2015 (UTC);;; ;;Greek cypriot? what the hell.arabic has no influence on greek cypriot what so ever. greek cypriot is a kinde of greek slang. if ever turkish cypriot has influences of arabic. get it right. —Preceding unsigned comment added by  92.22.120.89  (talk • Special:Contributions/ 92.22.120.89 |contribs) 12:51, 6 February 2011 (UTC);;;Section on history of ArabicIs Arabic 4th C? earliest records of mention to Arabic as a language? --Inayity (talk) 16:05, 19 February 2014 (UTC):See Classical Arabic#History. --Florian Blaschke (talk) 23:52, 28 March 2014 (UTC):I've now incorporated the relevant content from there into this article and tried to harmonise conflicting statements. --Florian Blaschke (talk) 01:32, 29 March 2014 (UTC)Arabic is an ancient language early evidence shows that Arabic was mention by the sumerians around 3,800 bc they were known as the Urapi there for Is much older than 4th centuary.ArabAmazigh12 (talk) 19:02, 10 July 2015 (UTC)422 million"If Arabic is considered a single language, it perhaps is spoken by as many as 422 million speakers in the Arab world".That's wrong and that's propaganda, 422 million is the total population of all countries with Arab as official or official among other languages.

I don't disagree with this, but it is safe to say that [dʒ] is considered the "most standard" of them. This means that speakers from anywhere in the Arab world may use either their respective dialectal sound or [dʒ] when speaking standard Arabic. So an Egyptian would pronounce the word ''jamîl'' as [gamiːl] or [dʒamiːl], but never [ʒamiːl]. And a Lebanese would pronounce [ʒamiːl] or [dʒamiːl], but never [gamiːl]. This means that [dʒ] is the only supraregionally accepted pronunciation of the letter. I think this should be clarified.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/93.206.162.155|93.206.162.155 (talk) 19:26, 3 April 2014 (UTC);; ;;Proofreading necessaryQuite apart from any dispute on the reliability of the content, this page needs quite a lot of simple proofreading.

No source is given (I put the "Citation needed" tag). It's quite hard to imagine how it could have been official - Morocco joined the Arab League in 1958, two years after achieving independence (1956), and its first Constitution was written in 1962. There is no indication at all that Moroccan Arabic was "official" during the French Protectorate either (although booklets to teach it to French-speaking people certainly existed). I've had a quick look at the documents signed during the process of achieving independence (and as far as I can see, no mention is made to language.

(This has been reverted in the meanwhile.) Regardless whether this conclusion is true or not (which doesn't matter anyway: recall that Wikipedia is about verifiability, not truth), it is unacceptable and recentist to take a single scholar's new proposal and treat it as gospel already. It's completely OK to mention serious new proposals – for all I care al-Jallad's argument may have merit, be 100% serious and even headed on its way to consensus –, but it goes overboard to promote them as fact before the print has even dried. (Zimriel's ridiculous accusation on my talk page that I'm a fundamentalist Muslim only because I don't fall over myself to accept every new hypothesis about the origin of the Arabic language as fact has to be one of the more blatant violations of WP:AGF I've had to endure lately, so far I'm left to wonder if Zimriel is a troll.
