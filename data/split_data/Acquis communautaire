The '''Community acquis'''[EuroVoc: Community acquis] or '''acquis communautaire''' (; ), sometimes called the '''EU acquis''' and often shortened to '''acquis''',"Collins"is the accumulated legislation, legal acts, and court decisions which constitute the body of European Union law. The term is French: ''acquis'' meaning "that which has been acquired or obtained", and ''communautaire'' meaning "of the community".ChaptersDuring the process of the enlargement of the European Union, the acquis was divided into 31 chapters for the purpose of negotiation between the EU and the candidate member states for the fifth enlargement (the ten that joined in 2004 plus Romania and Bulgaria which joined in 2007). These chapters were:{||-|#Free movement of goods#Free movement of persons#Freedom to provide services#Free movement of capital#Company law#Competition policy#Agriculture#Fisheries#Transport policy#Taxation#Economic and Monetary Union#Statistics#Social policy and employment#Energy#Industrial policy#Small and medium-sized enterprises| valign=top|Science and researchEducation and trainingTelecommunication and information technologiesCulture and audio-visual policyRegional policy and coordination of structural instrumentsEnvironmentConsumers and health protectionCooperation in the field of Justice and Home AffairsCustoms unionExternal relationsCommon Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP)Financial controlFinancial and budgetary provisionsInstitutionsOthers;/ol;|}For the negotiations with Croatia (which joined in 2013), Iceland, Turkey, Montenegro, Serbia and in the future, with Macedonia, Albania, (candidate countries), the acquis was/will be split up into 35 chapters instead, with the purpose of better balancing between the chapters: dividing the most difficult ones into separate chapters for easier negotiation, uniting some easier chapters, moving some policies between chapters, as well as renaming a few of them in the process:{||-|#Free movement of goods#Freedom of movement for workers#Right of establishment and freedom to provide services#Free movement of capital#Public procurement#Company law#Intellectual property law#Competition policy#Financial services#Information society and media#Agriculture and rural development#Food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy#Fisheries#Transport policy#Energy#Taxation#Economic and monetary policy#Statistics| valign=top|Social policy and employment;br(including anti-discrimination and equal opportunities for women and men);Enterprise and industrial policyTrans-European networksRegional policy and coordination of structural instrumentsJudiciary and fundamental rightsJustice, freedom and securityScience and researchEducation and cultureEnvironmentConsumer and health protectionCustoms unionExternal relationsForeign, security and defence policyFinancial controlFinancial and budgetary provisionsInstitutionsOther issues;/ol;|}Correspondence between chapters of the 5th and the 6th Enlargement:{| border="0" cellpadding="3"|-----! 5th Enlargement! 6th Enlargement|----- bgcolor="#efefff"| rowspan="2" valign="middle" | 1.

Other issues|}Such negotiations usually involved agreeing transitional periods before new member states needed to implement the laws of the European Union fully and before they and their citizens acquired full rights under the ''acquis''.TerminologyThe term ''acquis'' is also used to describe laws adopted under the Schengen Agreement, prior to its integration into the European Union legal order by the Treaty of Amsterdam, in which case one speaks of the ''Schengen acquis''.The term ''acquis'' has been borrowed by the World Trade Organization Appellate Body, in the case ''Japan ;ndash; Taxes on Alcoholic Beverages'', to refer to the accumulation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and WTO law ("''acquis gattien''"), though this usage is not well established.It has been used to describe the achievements of the Council of Europe (an international organisation unconnected with the European Union)::The Council of Europe’s ''acquis'' in standard setting activities in the fields of democracy, the rule of law and fundamental human rights and freedoms should be considered as milestones towards the European political project, and the European Court of Human Rights should be recognised as the pre-eminent judicial pillar of any future architecture.It has also been applied to the body of "principles, norms and commitments" of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE):[Intervention by Ambassador Aleksi Härkönen, Permanent Representative of Finland to the OSCE], Annual Security Review Conference.:Another question under debate has been how the Partners and others could implement the OSCE acquis, in other words its principles, norms, and commitments on a voluntary basis.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) introduced the concept of the OECD Acquis in its "[Strategy for enlargement and outreach]", May 2004.See also* Official Journal of the European Union* European Union lawReferencesExternal linksacquis*: European Union Law.*, Aligned multilingual parallel corpus: 23,000 Acquis-related texts per language, available in 22 languages.
