I noticed some ambiguity, confusion and errors in regard to the units discussed in the first paragraph and corrected them before discovering the "talk" page.  First, the article mentioned that the BAC is "unit-less", but then goes on to discuss in detail the many units that may be used to report the BAC measurement. I re-worded to clear up the confusion.  The reference to the California Code said California reports BAC in units of grams per milliliter; I corrected that to read the correct grams per 100 milliliters (which is, of course, the same as grams per deciliter).  Further, as the article went on to mention the several types of units of measure of blood alcohol and breath alcohol, the same value was used for each unit discussed.  I could see how someone might get the impression that .08 grams per deciliter of blood was the same volume as .08 mg/L of breath, so I changed the values to reflect the same volume for each unit of measure mentioned.  (i.e., 0.10 g/dL of blood alcohol is the same BAC as 0.476 mg/L of breath alcohol and the same as 0.10 g/210L of breath alcohol).  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/68.13.196.86|68.13.196.86 (talk) 04:10, 17 December 2010 (UTC);; ;;The Fifth SourceThe information from the fifth source on blood alcohol content doesn't add up.

Do you mean that drivers below the drinking age have a lower limit (i.e. effectively no alcohol, because they're not supposed to be drinking?''Oddly, underage refers not to driving before the legal age, but drinking before the legal age.  Alcohol purchase and posession laws would seem to preclude "underage drinking" and therefore "underage drunken driving.":: No, underage drinking isn't illegal, underage purchase and possession is. There's nothing illegal in the US about giving 14-year-olds wine with dinner.However, states pass laws limiting BAC for underage drunken drivers above 0.0% (often at 0.08%).  Perhaps this is a commetary on the legal system's opinion of the baseline capacity of teen drivers....  Less alcohol need be present to define an underage drunken driver as too impared to drive.  --BrantEatonI see what you're getting at, but the phrase underage drunken driving suggests there's a legal age for drunken driving. :)  Verloren:Sorry, my hair-splitting implements are all dull from too frequent use :)  I'm sure the actual statute utilizes excruciatingly clear language :)  I think we'll have to be satisifed that "underage" modifies the phrase "drunken driving," qualifying the activity by considering age.  Personal perspective notwithstanding, no explicit suggestion exists  indicating inebriated handling of a vehicle is permissible if the operator is above a minimum age.  --BrantEaton----On Wikipedia:Peer review, Mike Church expressed POV concerns about the following paragraph (written by him (?))."Despite the liberal intoxication limits of many countries, one should not assume that driving with a BAC rating of, say, .079% is safe. At a BAC rating of 0.05%, the probability of a driver having an accident is more than four times its base level. Despite this, some drivers believe their driving actually improves with small amounts of alcohol. This assertion is completely false: Their perception of their driving improves because they are more relaxed, but their actual motor competence is markedly lower than when sober. "In responding to this concern, I would say: cite your sources, e.g. "Research by Dr. T. Totaller found that a BAC level of 0.05% quadrupled the probability of a driving accident (see references)." I don't think the above paragraph is demonstrates a particularly strong bias, but if anyone does happen to think that, reporting the claims of experts is the way to go.In terms of giving advice, simply reporting the fact that intoxication increases the odds of an accident is providing information, but not giving advice. If we wrote, "So don't drink and drive, knucklehead," that would be giving advice ;-).  -- Cyan 02:25, 12 Mar 2004 (UTC)----I saw this come up on peer review as well.  I second Cyan's comments above.But what I do think would really make this article more approachable is if it used the statitics to show how much a person could drink in the USA and still drive, and how much is believed the affect someone's ability to drive.  Eg (with made up figures) "Under American law, an average person may drive after consuming 3 pints of beer (6 units of alcohol), however studies x and y show that the average person's ability to drive is affected after only half a pint of beer (one unit)."Then, once people have a sense of the amounts involved, you can go on to give the detailed explanation why it's the blood alcohol content which is measured not the number of drinks you've had, and you can't rely on these "average" figures.  It might also be interesting to include information on what level of alcohol in the blood is usually fatal, and the highest recorded cases of people exceeding this and survivng (alcoholics may build up a tolerance).

Mike Church 17:41, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)----Nice article, a few corrections1  BAC is literally blood alcohol content, not breath alcohol content. The Breathalyzer simply estimates BAC after measuring breath alcohol.2  Old versionMeasured with a machine commonly referred to as a Breathalyzer ... BAC is used as an ideally objective (and therefore, legally uncontestable) measure of the level of impairment of an individual,I changed it because it is literally false. BAC is used as an objective legal proxy for degree of intoxication, which in turn is only a rough guide to degree of impairment. In other words, to enforce the law, the law must be based on something fairly objective and harder to contest (like BAC) rather than something hard to measure objectively (impairment of driving judgement and skill). I think the writer has the right concept but expressed it wrongly.3  Old versionDespite this, some drivers believe their driving actually improves with small amounts of alcohol. This assertion is completely false: their perception of their driving improves because they are more relaxed, but their actual motor competence is markedly lower than when sober.I changed it because it is again literally false.The perception of his own driving skill deteriorates in accuracy and quality, not improves (in other words the gap between the reality of his skills and his perception of his skills increases). Again, right concept expressed awkwardly.alteripse 29 apr 04: Whoops. Sorry. I meant to say, with that bit (#3), that their ''perceived level of competence'' at driving improves; their actual ''skills of perception'' decline, as you said. Mike Church 19:54, 29 Apr 2004 (UTC)% or mg/ml?Our article says that BAC is measured as a percentage by volume, but all the sources I can find on the Web, e.g. [this one] and [this one], say it's measured in milligrams per millilitre (mg/ml) or per hundred millilitres (mg/100ml).  However, there are many other writers out there who state BAC as a percentage without saying what it's a percentage of.  This distinction matters: since the relative density of ethanol is 0.789 (Wikipedia) and that of blood is about 1.06 [(MSN Encarta)], the %-by-volume definition is about one-third drunker than the mg/ml definition.Who thinks I should change the article, and who thinks that it's right as it stands? --Heron 16:32, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)*I'm not sure how to answer, but despite the fact that ml is not a weight measure, like mg, that's how the California code is written, at least: "(b) It is unlawful for any person who has 0.08 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood to drive a vehicle. For purposes of this article and Section 34501.16, percent, by weight, of alcohol in a person's blood is based upon grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.". Seems kinda goofy to calculate based on different types of measures, but I guess it's not really a percentage (at least not "by weight"), despite what they say. I wonder if the discrepancy could be used to challenge a conviction. Niteowlneils 01:40, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)::It is a good question and one that has come up in the past, hence the way the law is written.  California, where I work, states clearly that if a person chooses to have their blood drawn, then they are presumed impaired if their blood alcohol content is 0.08 grams per deciliter, or if they choose to have their breath taken, their breath alcohol content is 0.08 grams per 2100 liters of breath.  The law used to be a lot less clear and defense attorneys did, indeed, try to muddy the waters by questioning the correlation between breath and blood alcohol levels.  The law was changed so that the presumtion of impairment is based directly on the evidentiary breath test result on its own, and now it is not an acceptable defense to claim that the correlation is inaccurate (though that doesnt prevent defense attorneys from trying).::At any rate, 0.08% is considered to be a "gram percentage," meaning that it approximates 1 gram = 1 milliliter of solution, which is of course not completely accurate, but as long as everybody is using the same definition (grams per deciliter) then it really isn't an issue.

Within a day?  Within an hour?  I mean, five drinks in a stretched amount of time doesn't have the same affect is it does within a shorter time period.I agree, the table says:12 Drinks=.30-.40% BAC=Loss of consciousnessI'd like to see good solid evidence of this, a BAC of .3 to .4 can cause a loss of consciousness, but only 12 drinks to get there is a little extreme. I'm 6' and weigh 272lb, 250lb when training. During a Sunday football game, I used to consume about a 12-pack, since their is usually a double header, I might end up drinking 24 beers. If what the chart says is correct, then by the end of the first game, I should have had a BAC of .30 and be out. The highest my BAC ever has been was .45, after drinking an entire bottle of Jack Daniels. As a recovering alcoholic, I have a little experience here. Maybe there should be a time on the chart as well. -cplradarI think it'd better to have an expanded table between the typical BAC and its affects; I found this site that describes several levels and a fairly detailed explainationsMy360pi 22:29, 25 February 2007 (UTC)You done't say what your condition was at .45% but speaking from some experience, the bigger you are the more you will need to drink. Here are some examples I've had experience with.While training others, we give subjects measured amounts of alcohol and measure their BrAC (Breath Alcohol Content) For a large male (270lbs) the scale given is very close, meaning a 6-pack in 2 hours will mean approximately .07% BrAC. For an average size male (185lbs) about .09% BrAC. Everyone is different, just like fingerprints. Fingerprints are all fingerprint though. Scientists hypothesis with averages to make sense of things and test them. I still don't get (1g of alcohol per 100/ml breath by volume.) I know the breath machines, any of them, are weighted towards the subject providing the sample. In my experience, blood tested comes back with a higher BAC than BrAC on the same person.An alcoholic will metabolize the alcohol faster as the body is adapting to the constant presents of alcohol. An alcoholic was arrested and gave a sample that read 0.28% BrAC. 4-hours later, he gave another sample that read 0.18 BrAC. An average drinker would have been around .25% BrAC after 4-hours. An alcoholic can also function with larger amounts of alcohol and as the addiction sets in, need more and more to satisfy it. An elderly lady (83) had a breath alcohol of .37% BrAC with normal function. I have never seen any readings over .25% BrAC that the person could even stand unless they were a heavy drinker.Gobil527 (talk) 22:48, 15 July 2008 (UTC)Gibbs, KAlcoholics can build up an impressive alcohol resistance.

Could we please either tidy up the usage of units through the article, or better, fully state the units at every usage. For instance. The section "Effect at different levels" gives no units other that "%". Although the units section does say that just "%" on its own means % w/w, g/100g isn't the only one measured in %, and since the difference between the % units is a power of 10, it can be quite confusing. It also standard that if you use a %, you state whether you mean w/w, w/v, or v/v.If nothing else, can we change it from saying something like "0.50%" in every row to "0.5" in the row and adding "% (g/100g)" or "% w/w" to the column header cell.Personally, I think that since ICAP uses mg/ml as a standard unit, that should be the unit used whenever possible through the article. Here's an example ICAP report. The units through it are mg/ml as seen in the table of BAC's legal to drive in different countries.--KX36 12:01, 15 September 2006 (UTC)Limits for US bus drivers* Countries with a 0.08% limit include Republic of Ireland, the United States[1] and Canada.[2] In the United States, operators of common carriers, such as buses, are restricted to a 0.10% limit, and the Federal Aviation Regulations governing U.S. pilots prohibit operation of an aircraft within eight hours of consumption or while having as little as 0.04 percent of alcohol by weight in the blood.[3] For further information on US laws, see Alcohol laws of the United States by state.So bus operators are allowed more alcohol than private drivers??

Wikipedia’s table should incorporate data from other sources. I suggest a good starting place is the FAA’s take on on the subject ([Federal Aviation Regulation (CFR) 91.17, Table 2, here]). The FAA’s binned values overlap, but by interpolating, it effectivly states that at BAC values of ;0.03%, the ''“average individual appears normal”'' and does not suffer from impaired judgement or other ill effects.  No legitimate case can be made here for simply parroting data from a single source if that data flies in the face of common sense (like impairment at 0.01%). That’s horse crap.

(first paragraph)This is a bad example because the gram ("per 100 grams") is a unit of mass, not a unit of volume.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/66.175.215.29|66.175.215.29 (talk) 20:02, 17 February 2008 (UTC);;; ;;Also, The summary at the beginning describes "volume per volume" yet the "Units of measurement" section indicates "never volume per volume".

Do the "general" lines not specifying a specific country belong to the country that is listed above them? Since they are not general rules applying to all countries I would guess so, but the table could be made clearer. An example of this would be the line "• learner drivers and provisional/probationary drivers". I am suggesting to maybe remove the dividing line between these items, to show that they belong together.

While they may fine you for careless driving, you can get a sentence of imprisonment for dangerous driving.You might be thinking of driving impaired rather than acting or driving dangerously.  Driving impaired doesn't mean you are driving dangerously (within the meaning of that section of the Criminal Code).  Rather, driving impaired means specifically that an individual's ability to operate a motor vehicle is impaired to any degree at all.  So there is no requirement that an individual be driving dangerously per say as long as they have some impairment of their ability to operate a motor vehicle.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/24.65.94.206|24.65.94.206 (talk) 05:27, 16 December 2009 (UTC);; ;;It varies by province.

Jersey John (talk) 17:30, 16 February 2009 (UTC) just my $0.02It's relativeEveryone is so focused on the weight of a TINY woman. A 90 pound woman getting a 0.30 is unbelievable? BAC is RELATIVE. It is a measure that gives a pretty much absolute number by dividing out relative numbers against each other. All the things that apply to a 90 pound woman with a 0.30 also apply to a 400 pound man with a 0.30 rating. The only thing that differs is their weights. And, as a consequence, the numbers of drinks they've had. With a 0.30, both the woman and the man are "just as drunk" in most cases...Of course, news agencies always use that fact. Because most of the general population doesn't seem to get this. It sounds much more impressive to have a 90 pound woman blow a 0.30 than a 400 pound man. But, really, there's NO DIFFERENCE. And, in this way, the news agencies keep contributing to the ignorance.

I have only just started to read it and already I am confused by1.  A statemment in the header which clearly indicates that Blood alcohol content is abbreviated as BAC but then later the article talks about Breath alcohol content (a different measure) also using the abbreviation BAC.  If both acronyms are used by different authorities around the world, then this article SHOULD NOT use either acronym as it is confusing to the reader. If there is an internationally agreed alternate abbreviation nomenclature that avoids this, then the article should use that abbreviation nomenclature instead. It would be a simple matter to include a table indicating what usually BAC means in each country if there is a standard interpretation in each nation.2.  The header begins by saying that blood alcohol content is usually measured using ONE method, but then it goes on to show that blood alcohol content is actually measured in a variety of ways. This is very unhelpful to the reader as we do not know what "usually" means. My immediate inclination was to remove the reference to "usually" and simply explain that there is a multitude of measurements in the field and explain briefly what they are (at least in the header section).3. There is a table that gives BAC as a percentage!  This presumable is meaningless without a clue as to whether this is the ethanol percentage by WEIGHT or by VOLUME. These figues cannot be the same unless blood and alcohol have the same density (which I very much doubt).I am assuming that there is broad equivalence between these different measures.  A conversion table from one unit to the other would be useful.Comments please Template:Unsigned --; ;;Comment:I reached a similar conclusion regarding a missing "10:1 factor". In the article there is a section that suggests the BAC can be calculated directly as a percentage of body water, i.e alcohol consumed divided by body water content. For example 40 ml of alcohol weighs approximately 32 grams, and for a man of 70 kg with body water content of 58% the BAC calculation is: (100 x  32/40600) or 0.079% w/w.Since water (SG =1) is used in the calculation, percentage w/v would yield a similar numerical result.A man of 70kg has typically 6 liters of blood (SG = 1.06) and blood is 70% water. Therefore the water contained in the blood is (6 x 1.06 x 70/100) = 4.452 kg.This represents 11% of the total body water and the alcohol in blood on a pro-rata basis, is(32 X 11/100) = 3.52 gram. The BAC is 100*(3.52/6000)= 0.059% w/vAs an engineer I would probably split the difference of the 2 results and show the BAC as 0.07 +/- 0.01 % w/v.The ratio of water in blood to total body water provides a reasonable explanation for the missing10:1 factor. Comments from someone with a background in physiology/anatomy would be useful.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/86.31.166.221|86.31.166.221 (talk) 17:51, 6 June 2010 (UTC);; ;;Whiskey Dickshould this term appear in this article?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/75.87.137.127|75.87.137.127 (talk) 12:52, 23 June 2010 (UTC);; ;;:Not really. – Acdx (talk;/i;);18:06, 23 June 2010 (UTC)Rate of Alcohol Metabolism...

Yes, there is some mention of the variation between states, but I am unaware of a state that does not allow a DUI conviction at 0.05% (technically, a conviction can come at 0.0% at least in some states, even if it is only alcohol).Yes, I am aware that the phrase 'legal limits' is used, possibly implying the upper most limit, but such a term is misleading at ''best'', and possibly dangerous.In the case of the United States, I therefore suggest it should be clearly stated that the offense of driving while intoxicated is committed when a driver's BAC meets or exceeds 0.08%, but that in many (most?) states, the same offense is committed when a driver tests at 0.05%, along with other evidence, such as a failed Field Sobriety Test.I generally dislike being this picky, but the misleading term 'legal limit' really could be dangerous under these circumstances.
