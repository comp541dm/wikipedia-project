CalvinAndHobbes3.oggFile:Calvin wikiworld.jpgWasteful Talk PagesWhile it says this is not a forum for the articles subject that's pretty much what it has become. Opinionated conversations and irrelevent material have dominated the forum. I suggest that anything posted before March 2011 should be archived.Special:Contributions/TAS1957|TAS1957 (talk) 16 August 2011 (UTC)*  -- Alexf(talk);/i; 19:32, 16 August 2011 (UTC)Thank you User:Alexf.

That's promotional and it's overlinkage to a single site (which contains unlicensed copyrighted material, by the way). --Tenebrae (talk) 05:06, 14 April 2012 (UTC)Hobbes and BaconShould the article may include a reference to the fan comic strip ?

One finds it hard not to get choked up at these wonderful additions to the Calvin and Hobbes Lore. I for one think these should be included at the bottom of the article.Dennis M. Myers (talk) 00:44, 4 June 2013 (UTC):Emotional reactions should have no impact on deciding whether or not links should be added. It's a fan work with no proven notability. It does not belong in this article. '''User:The Stick Man|TheStickMan;/font;'''User talk:The Stick Man|[✆Talk];/font; 15:18, 6 June 2013 (UTC)add awards?I noticed that several other comic pages include a list of awards the comic strip has one.''Calvin and Hobbes'' has won numerous awards, but none of them are listed here. However, they are listed on Bill Watterson's biography page.Should we just copy that section and paste it onto here as well? Explorser (talk) 23:03, 9 January 2013 (UTC):No - if it's already on another page, simply put in a statement about the awards and link it to Watterson's page. Ckruschke (talk) 17:46, 10 January 2013 (UTC)Ckruschke::Thank you, I recently did so. Feel free to look in the history section for the edit. Explorser (talk) 02:14, 1 February 2013 (UTC)Top Importance?There's a discussion on which comic-related articles should be listed as "Top Importance" on the importance scale, and I feel this article should not be included. If any user disagrees or wishes to contribute, please do so there. Argento Surfer (talk) 14:43, 1 February 2013 (UTC)The HSKA problem I have stumbled upon in the somewhat recent past is that the date of the new name's appearance is/was wrong. I have found that the date I always find it referred to is May 5, 1991, which is inaccurate. The ''real'' date for the strip in question is June 21, 1992. I know this for a fact because it is in the free-form half-page panel format, a format the Universal Press Syndicate only allowed Watterson to use ''after'' his first sabbatical, which ''started'' on May 6, 1991, the very next day.The thing that frustrates me is that whenever I attempt to fix this error, SOMEONE- (I don't know who) almost always changes the date from June 21, 1992- the ''correct'' date, to May 5, 1991, the ''wrong'' one. Please feel free to add comments and questions below.P.S. If they change it back ''again'', I will report this incident to the administrators. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 98.246.84.7  (talk • Special:Contributions/98.246.84.7 |contribs) 23:49, 18 July 2013‎;;;: What you "know" isn't important on Wikipedia.  But it happens that The Complete Calvin ; Hobbes says it's June 21, 1992, so I've replaced the incorrect GoComics reference with the TCCH one. RossPatterson (talk) 11:28, 19 July 2013 (UTC)::Just making sure, you own a copy of the complete collection and it was definitely published in June? I was the one who was changing it back (and you can see who made what changes by click the "View history" button by the search bar) so I just want to be 100% certain on this so that I know better next time. I had originally thought that the GoComics source had simply made a mistake since they had the HSK strip for both May '91 and June '92, and some searching on the Internet seemed to confirm that. '''User:The Stick Man|TheStickMan;/font;'''User talk:The Stick Man|[✆Talk];/font; 16:08, 19 July 2013 (UTC):::Yes.  I had the book open in front of me when I typed the citation :-) And in fact, TCCH notes at the bottom of v. 3 p. 225, which ends with the strip from May 4, 1991, "''Bill Watterson goes on sabbatical until February 1992''", and the next strip (v. 3 p. 227) is February 2, 1992.  So there never was a May 5, 1991 strip. RossPatterson (talk) 14:02, 20 July 2013 (UTC)::::Ah, I see. Cool, thanks for letting me know. '''User:The Stick Man|TheStickMan;/font;'''User talk:The Stick Man|[✆Talk];/font; 14:42, 20 July 2013 (UTC)Contemporary United StatesCurrently, the intro says, "Calvin and Hobbes is set in the contemporary United States in an unspecified suburban area," which seemed strange for a comic that hasn't been published in almost 2 decades. Should we add "then-contemporary" or something like that? Special:Contributions/76.95.194.202|76.95.194.202 (talk) 02:02, 6 December 2013 (UTC):Late 20th century?

G S Palmer (talk) 20:53, 3 April 2014 (UTC)Move Protected?I noticed this article is move protected and was wondering if that's still needed since it doesn't seem any issues with unauthorized/undiscussed moves have made it onto this talk page over the past three years. Maybe there's some issue I'm not aware of. If it's to protect this article from well-meaning IP's, I'm all for it; I just find it odd that I can't find any discussion within the past three or four years on this page about this issue. Luthien22 (talk) 03:46, 28 September 2014 (UTC):Looks like way back in 2008 (according to ) there was some vandalism trouble, so an admin just move protected because he figured that there would be no reason to remove it. Were you thinking about moving it? '''User:The Stick Man|TheStickMan'''User talk:The Stick Man|[✆Talk] 07:51, 28 September 2014 (UTC)::The article's fine; I just thought that if there hadn't been any trouble within a reasonable amount of time, there's no reason for it to stay protected. Honestly, I'm not sure what people would even want to move this to. The title is pretty self-explanatory. Luthien22 (talk) 22:27, 28 September 2014 (UTC):::That looks like that was the admin's logic actually. No one would ever have any reason to move the article to a different title, so no one would really have much to complain if it was move protected.

The LA Times article was in 1987 not 1967. Also, while I can't find the exact number of strips, it can't possibly be 10996 since the strip only ran for 10 years.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/76.198.129.124|76.198.129.124 (talk) 23:54, 18 June 2015 (UTC);;; ;;External links modifiedHello fellow Wikipedians,I have just added archive links to 1 external links on Calvin and Hobbes.
