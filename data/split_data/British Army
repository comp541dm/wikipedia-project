The '''British Army''' is the principal land warfare force of the United Kingdom. The force was initially administered by the War Office from London, which in 1964 was subsumed into the Ministry of Defence. The professional head of the British Army is the Chief of the General Staff.The full-time element of the British Army is referred to as the ''Regular Army'' and has been since the creation of the reservist ''Territorial Force'' in 1908. All members of the British Army swear (or affirm) allegiance to the monarch as commander-in-chief. However, the Bill of Rights of 1689 requires Parliamentary consent for the Crown to maintain a standing army in peacetime. Parliament approves the continued existence of the Army by passing an Armed Forces Act at least once every five years.Throughout its history, the British Army has seen action in a number of major wars involving the world's great powers, including the Seven Years' War, the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War, the First World War and Second World War. Repeatedly emerging victorious from these decisive wars allowed Britain to influence world events with its policies and establish itself as one of the world's leading military and economic powers. Since the end of the Cold war, the British Army has been deployed to many conflict zones, often as part of an expeditionary force or a United Nations peacekeeping operation. Additionally, the British Army maintains several permanent overseas postings.HistoryHistory of the British ArmyFile:John Churchill Marlborough porträtterad av Adriaen van der Werff (1659-1722).jpg|thumb|John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, was one of the first generals in the British Army, fighting campaigns in the War of the Spanish Succession.The English Army was first established as a standing military force in 1660. In 1707 many regiments of the English and Scottish armies were already combined under one operational command and stationed in the Netherlands fighting in the War of Spanish Succession. Consequently, although the regiments were now part of the new British military establishment, they remained under the same operational command, and so not only were the regiments of the old armies transferred ''in situ'' to the new army so too was the institutional ethos, customs, and traditions, of the old standing armies that had been created shortly after the restoration of the monarchy 66 years earlier. The order of seniority of the most senior line regiments in the British Army is based on the order of seniority in the English army. Scottish and Irish regiments were only allowed to take a rank in the English army from the date of their arrival in England or the date when they were first placed on the English establishment. For example, in 1694 a board of general officers was convened to decide the rank of English, Irish and Scots regiments serving in the Netherlands; the regiment that became known as the Scots Greys were designated as the 4th Dragoons because there were three English regiments raised prior to 1688 when the Scots Greys were first placed on the English establishment. In 1713, when a new board of general officers was convened to decide upon the rank of several regiments, the seniority of the Scots Greys was reassessed and based on their entry into England in June 1685. At that time there was only one English regiment of dragoons, and so after some delay the Scots Greys obtained the rank of 2nd Dragoons in the British Army.Following William and Mary's accession to the throne, England involved itself in the War of the Grand Alliance, primarily to prevent a French invasion restoring Mary's father, James II. Following the union of England and Scotland in 1707, and the creation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801, British foreign policy on the continent was to contain expansion by its competitor powers such as France and Spain. Spain, in the previous two centuries, had been the dominant global power, and the chief threat to England's early transatlantic ambitions, but was now waning. The territorial ambitions of the French, however, led to the War of the Spanish Succession. and the Napoleonic Wars.ma165Russian activity led to the Crimean War.ma195After 1745, recruits were increasingly drawn from Scotland; by the mid-1760s between one fifth and one third of officers were from Scotland.''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Army'' (1994) p. 103From the time of the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763, Great Britain, and its successor, the United Kingdom, was one of the leading military and economic powers of the world.Early British EmpireFile:The Battle of Culloden.jpg|thumb|The extinction of the Scottish clan system came with the defeat of the clansmen at the Battle of Culloden in 1746The British Empire expanded in this time to include colonies, protectorates, and Dominions throughout the Americas, Africa, Asia and Australasia. Although the Royal Navy is widely regarded as having been vital for the rise of the British Empire, and British dominance of the world, the British Army played an important role in the colonisation of India and other regions.. Typical tasks included garrisoning the colonies, capturing strategically important territories, and participating in actions to pacify colonial borders, provide support to allied governments, suppress Britain's rivals, and protect against foreign powers and hostile natives.File:Benjamin West 005.jpg|thumb|left|The death of General Wolfe during the Battle of the Plains of Abraham; the campaigns of the French and Indian War resulted in British control of modern Canada.British soldiers also helped capture strategically important territories, allowing the empire to expand. The army was also involved in numerous wars to pacify the borders, or to prop up friendly governments, and thereby keep other, competitive, empires away from the British Empire's borders. Among these actions were the Seven Years' War,. the American Revolutionary War,. the Napoleonic Wars,. the First and Second Opium Wars, the Boxer Rebellion,. the New Zealand wars, the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857,. the First and Second Boer Wars,. the Fenian raids, the Irish War of Independence,. its serial interventions into Afghanistan (which were meant to maintain a friendly buffer state between British India and the Russian Empire),. and the Crimean War (to keep the Russian Empire at a safe distance by coming to Turkey's aid)..As had its predecessor, the English Army, the British Army fought Spain, France, and the Netherlands for supremacy in North America and the West Indies. With native and provincial assistance, the Army conquered New France in the North American theatre of the Seven Years' Warma106and subsequently suppressed a Native American uprising in Pontiac's War.

The war between the British and the First French Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte stretched around the world and at its peak, in 1813, the regular army contained over 250,000 men. A Coalition of Anglo-Dutch and Prussian Armies under the Duke of Wellington and Field Marshal von Blücher defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815..The English had been involved, both politically and militarily, in Ireland since being given the Lordship of Ireland by the Pope in 1171. The campaign of the English republican Protector, Oliver Cromwell, involved uncompromising treatment of the Irish towns (most notably Drogheda and Wexford) that had supported the Royalists during the English Civil War. The English Army (and subsequently the British Army) stayed in Ireland primarily to suppress numerous Irish revolts and campaigns for independence. In addition to its ongoing conflict with ethnic Irish nationalists, it was faced with the prospect of battling Anglo-Irish and Ulster Scots peoples in Ireland, angered primarily by unfavourable taxation of Irish produce imported into Britain, who, alongside other Irish groups, had raised their own volunteer army and threatened to emulate the American colonists if their conditions were not met. Having learnt from their experience in America, the British government sought a political solution. The British Army found itself fighting Irish rebels, both Protestant and Catholic, primarily in Ulster and Leinster (Wolfe Tone's United Irishmen) in the 1798 rebellion.[The 1798 Irish Rebellion] BBCFile:Alphonse de Neuville - The defence of Rorke's Drift 1879 - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|The Battle of Rorke's Drift in 1879 saw a small British force repel an overwhelming attack by Zulu forces; eleven Victoria Crosses were awarded for the defence.In addition to battling the armies of other European Empires (and of its former colonies, the United States, in the American War of 1812), in the battle for global supremacy, the British Army fought the Chinese in the First and Second Opium Wars,ma102and the Boxer Rebellion,boxerMāori people|Māori tribes in the first of the New Zealand Wars,nzNawab Shiraj-ud-Daula's forces and British East India Company mutineers in the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857,ma257the Boers in the First and Second Boer Wars,ma257Irish Fenians in Canada during the Fenian raidsfenianand Irish separatists in the Anglo-Irish War.ma102The vastly increasing demands of imperial expansion, and the inadequacies and inefficiencies of the underfunded, post-Napoleonic Wars British Army, and of the Militia, Yeomanry, and Volunteer Force, led to the Cardwell and Childers Reforms of the late 19th century, which gave the British Army its modern shape, and redefined its regimental system. The Haldane Reforms of 1907 formally created the Territorial Force as the Army's volunteer reserve component by merging and reorganising the Volunteer Force, Militia, and Yeomanry..World warsBritish Army during the Second World WarFile:British Mark I male tank Somme 25 September 1916.jpg|right|thumb|British Mark I tank during the First World War.

Armoured vehicles of this time still required much infantry and artillery support and still do to a lesser extent today. The photo was taken by Ernest Brooks.Great Britain's dominance of the world had been challenged by numerous other powers; in the 20th century, most notably Germany. A century before, it was still vying with Napoleonic France for pre-eminence in Europe and around the world, and Hannoverian Britain's natural allies were the various Kingdoms and principalities of Northern Germany. By the middle of the 19th century, Britain and France were allied in preventing Russia's appropriation of the Ottoman Empire (although it was the fear of French invasion that led, shortly after, to the creation of the Volunteer Force). By the first decade of the 20th century, however, the United Kingdom was allied with France (by the Entente Cordiale) and Russia (which had its own secret agreement with France of mutual support in any war against the Prussian-led German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire), and when the First World War broke out in 1914, the British Army sent the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to France and Belgium to prevent Germany from occupying these countries.. The British Army created the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force in Egypt and sent it to Gallipoli in an unsuccessful attempt to capture Constantinople and secure a sea route to Russia. After the retreat from Gallipoli nearly 400,000 men in 13 divisions from the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force and the Force in Egypt formed a strategic reserve in Egypt called the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. With most of the strategic reserve sent to the Western Front, an Egyptian Expeditionary Force of two British infantry and one Australian and New Zealand mounted division in the Eastern Force, successfully defend the Suez Canal and Romani in 1916 from German and Ottoman incursions.Falls 1930 Vol. 1, pp. 380–406 This force captured the Sinai and garrisoned the extended lines of communication, but in early 1917 their advance was stopped at Gaza until towards the end of the year when a greatly enlarged force of infantry and mounted troops captured Beersheba, most of southern Palestine and Jerusalem. Allenby's force, now including Indian Army units which replaced a number of British units sent to the Western Front, captured the southern Jordan Valley in 1918 and carried out two major, but unsuccessful attacks to Amman and Es Salt and occupied part of the Jordan Valley, during preparations for his final successful assault in September at the Battle of Megiddo. As a result of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force's capture of two Ottoman armies, an armistice with the Ottoman Empire was signed on 31 October 1918.Carver 2003 pp. 194–244File:El Alamein 1942 - British infantry.jpg|thumb|left|The Second Battle of El Alamein reversed German ambitions in North Africa, and is often cited as one of the turning points of the Second World War.The First World War was the most devastating in British military history, with nearly 800,000 men killed and over 2million wounded. In the early part of the war, the professional force of the BEF was virtually destroyed and, by turns, a volunteer (and then conscripted) force replaced it. Major battles included the Battle of the Somme and the Battle of Passchendaele.. Advances in technology saw advent of the tank, with the creation of the Royal Tank Regiment, and advances in aircraft design, with the creation of the Royal Flying Corps, which were to be decisive in future battles. Trench warfare dominated strategy on the Western Front, and the use of chemical and poison gases added to the devastation.The Second World War broke out in September 1939 with the German invasion of Poland.. British assurances to the Polish led the British Empire to declare war on Germany. Again an Expeditionary Force (BEF) was sent to France,ma335only to be hastily evacuated as the German forces swept through the Low Countries and across France in May 1940.. Only the Dunkirk evacuation saved the entire BEF from capture.ma342Later, however, the British would have spectacular success defeating the Italians and Germans at the Battle of El Alamein in North Africa from 1942–1943, Italy and in the D-Day invasion of Normandy in June 1944 with the help of American, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Indian and Free French forces. Almost half of the Allied soldiers on D-Day were British. In the Far East, the British Army battled the Japanese in the Burma Campaign. The Second World War saw the British Army develop its Special Air Service, Commando units and the Parachute Regiment..Postcolonial eraFile:Argentine POWs guarded by 2 Para.jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers from the Parachute Regiment guard Argentine prisoners of war during the Falklands War.After the end of the Second World War, the British Army was significantly reduced in size, although National Service continued until 1960.. This period also saw the process of decolonisation commence with the partition and independence of India and Pakistan, followed by the independence of British colonies in Africa and Asia. Accordingly, the army's strength was further reduced, in recognition of Britain's reduced role in world affairs, outlined in the 1957 Defence White Paper. This was despite major actions in Korea in the early 1950s"M 384"and Suez in 1956.. A large force of British troops also remained in Germany, facing the threat of Soviet invasion.. The British Army of the Rhine was the Germany garrison formation, with the main fighting force being I (BR) Corps. The Cold War saw significant technological advances in warfare and the Army saw more technologically advanced weapons systems come into service..Despite the decline of the British Empire, the Army was still deployed around the world, fighting wars in Aden,. Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|Indonesia, Cyprus,ma401Kenyama401and Malaya.. In 1982 the British Army, alongside the Royal Marines, helped to liberate the Falkland Islands during the Falklands conflict against Argentina, after Argentina's invasion of the British territory.In the three decades following 1969, the Army was heavily deployed in Northern Ireland, to support the Royal Ulster Constabulary (later the Police Service of Northern Ireland) in their conflict with republican paramilitary groups, called Operation Banner.. The locally recruited Ulster Defence Regiment was formed, later becoming home service battalions in the Royal Irish Regiment in 1992, before being disbanded in 2006. Over 700 soldiers were killed during the Troubles. Following the IRA ceasefires between 1994 and 1996 and since 1997, demilitarisation has taken place as part of the peace process, reducing the military presence from 30,000 to 5,000 troops.[Army ending its operation in NI] BBC News, 31 July 2007 On 25 June 2007, the Second Battalion Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment vacated the Army complex at Bessbrook Mill in Armagh.

The full-time element of the British Army is referred to as the ''Regular Army'' since the creation of the reservist ''Territorial Force'' in 1908.The size and structure of the British Army is continually evolving. Accordingly, the Ministry of Defence publishes monthly reports on personnel. Figures for 1 January 2015 show; 87,140 Regulars, 2,720 Gurkhas"Regular ; Gurkha";[gov.uk MoD - regular personnel], table 2-page 8. 1 January 2015. and 25,010 Army Reservists[gov.uk MoD - quarterly personnel report], table 3 page 8. 1 January 2015. for a combined component strength of 114,870 personnel. Of those Regulars and Gurkhas; 80,590 and 2,650 were trained, respectively."Regular ; Gurkha"The future transformation of the British Army is referred to as "Army 2020", which is the result of the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) in October 2010 and a number of following reviews and modifications thereafter. According to the Ministry of Defence, Army 2020 will "ensure that the British Army remains the most capable Army in its class" and enable "it to better meet the security challenges of the 2020s and beyond".[Transforming The British Army] July 2012 Initially, the SDSR outlined a reduction of the Regular British Army by 7,000 to a trained strength of 95,000 personnel by 2015. However, following a further independent review on the future structure of the British Army, "Future Reserves 2020", it was announced that the Regular Army will be reduced to a trained strength of 82,000 while the Army Reserve will be increased to a trained strength of around 30,000 personnel. There will of course be an added margin for soldiers in training. This reform will bring the ratio of regular and part-time personnel of the British Army in line with US and Canadian allies.2012 Perhaps the most important aspect of Army 2020 is that the Army Reserve will become "fully integrated" with the Regular Army and "better prepared" for overseas deployments and operations.In addition to the active elements of the British Army (Regular and Army Reserve), all ex-Regular Army personnel remain liable to be recalled for duty in a time of need, this is known as the Regular Reserve.[British Army: Regular Reserve], 27 January 2014 The Regular Reserve is separated into two categories: A and D. Category A is mandatory, with the length of time serving in category A depending on time spent in Regular service. Category D is voluntary and consists of personnel who are no-longer required to serve in category A. Regular Reserves in both category A and D serve under a fixed-term reserve contract and are liable to report for training or service overseas and at home."Ragular-Reserve"These contracts are similar in nature to those of the Army Reserve., table 3-page 13 – read note 2. April 2013. The Long Term  reserve is also part of the Regular Reserve but excludes personnel serving in categories A and D. Unlike the other reserves the Long Term  reserve do not serve under a contract of any sort, instead they retain a "statutory liability for service" and may be recalled to service under Section 52 of the Reserve Forces Act (RFA) 1996 (until the age of 55)."Ragular-Reserve"In 2007 there were 121,800 Regular Reserves of the British Army, of which, 33,760 served in categories A and D., table 3-page 5. April 2012.Publications since April 2013 no longer report the entire strength of the Regular Reserve, instead they only give a figure for the Regular Reserves serving in categories A and D only.

It is broadly split into the Regular Army (full-time Officers/soldiers and units) and the Army Reserve (Spare-time Officers/soldiers and units).In terms of its military structure, it has two parallel organisations, one administrative and one operational.'''Administrative'''* Regiments and Corps. These are listed below (in the template to the right), ranging from the Household Cavalry to the Army Physical Training Corps and the Royal Logistic Corps. Uniquely and somewhat confusingly, the Infantry, which is not a corps but a collection of separate regiments, is administered by 'Divisions' of infantry – Guards Division, Queen's Division, Scottish Division and so on..'''Operational'''* The major operational command is based at Andover and is known as "Army Headquarters". Defence Marketing Intelligence, 10 November 2011 It is split into divisions and subordinate units ranging from regiments to squadrons.* Divisions (1 Div. based in Herford in Germany and 3 Div. based in Bulford).** Brigades, both fighting and in a non-fighting regional capacity within HQ LF (for example, 43 (Wessex) Brigade based in Bulford).Structure of unitsThe standard operational units are structured as follows, although various units have their own structure, conventions, names and sizes:{| class="wikitable"|-!Type of Unit!Division!Brigade!Battalion / Regiment!Company/ Squadron!Platoon / Troop!Section!Fire Team|-!Contains|2–3 Brigades|3–5 Battalions|5–7 Companies|3 Platoons|3 Sections|2 Fire Teams|4 Individuals|-!Personnel|10,000|5,000|550–750|100|30|8–10|4|-!Commanded by|Maj-Gen|Brig|Lt Col|Maj|Capt, Lt or 2nd Lt|Cpl|LCpl|}Corps are made up of two or more divisions, but now are rarely deployed as a purely national formation due to the size of the British Army."SAS"In place of a Battalion, a task-specific Battlegroup may be formed. A battlegroup is grown around the core of either an armoured regiment or infantry battalion, and has other units added or removed from it as necessary for its purpose. It results in a mixed formation of armour, infantry, artillery, engineers and support units, typically consisting of between 600 and 700 soldiers under the command of a Lieutenant Colonel."SAS"A number of elements of the British Army use alternative terms for battalion, company and platoon. These include the Royal Armoured Corps, Corps of Royal Engineers, Royal Logistic Corps, and the Royal Corps of Signals who use regiment (battalion), squadron (company) and troop (platoon). The Royal Artillery are unique in using the term regiment in place of both corps and battalion, they also replace company with battery and platoon with troop."SAS"DivisionsThe British Army currently has two operational divisions.{| class="wikitable"|-!Name !!

Whereas the old Commonwealth Dominions, such as Canada and Australia, had their own armies before achieving complete independence, units raised in those territories which remained part of the realm of the UK were, and are, ultimately under the control of the UK government, and do not constitute separate armies. The UK retains responsibility for the defence of all of the fourteen remaining British Overseas Territories. Although the Cayman Islands premier has stated the desire to raise a Cayman Islands Defence Force when it can be afforded (it currently has only the Cayman Islands Cadet Corps), becoming the fifth, only four of the remaining British Overseas Territories retain locally raised regiments:* Royal Bermuda Regiment[DefenceNews ArticleRoyal Anglian soldiers boost Bermuda Regiment] Defence News, 19 January 2011,* Royal Gibraltar Regiment[Royal Gibraltar Regiment trains in UK] Defence News, 12 May 2011* Falkland Islands Defence Force[Falkland Islands Defence Force: 150 years of Voluntary Service] Falklands Info, November 2004* Royal Montserrat Defence ForceImage:Falklandsdf.jpg|Falkland Islands Defence Force on parade in June 2013.File:Detachment of Falkland Islands Defence Force.jpg|A detachment of the Falkland Islands Defence Force in ceremonial dress.File:Bermuda Regiment PNCO Cadre Promotion Parade.jpg|Royal Bermuda Regiment on paradeFile:Bermuda Regiment.JPG|Royal Bermuda Regiment Soldiers in Barbados for Cricket World Cup 2007File:Changing of the Guard duo - Royal Gibraltar Regiment.jpg|Changing of the Guard - Royal Gibraltar Regiment in 2012.File:21 Gun Salute in Gibraltar marking the birth of Prince George of Cambridge 02.jpg|21 Gun Salute in Gibraltar marking the birth of Prince George of Cambridge, 2013.Royal Navy and RAF ground unitsThe other armed services have their own infantry units which are not part of the British Army.

In the early years of the 21st century there has been a marked increase in the number of recruits from other (mostly Commonwealth) countries. In 2006 overseas recruitment, mostly in Commonwealth countries, generated more than 6,000 soldiers from 54 nations; together with the 3,000 Gurkhas, 10% of the British Army are foreign nationals. ''New Statesman'', 5 February 2007The Ministry of Defence now caps the number of recruits from Commonwealth countries, although this will not affect the Gurkhas, as Nepal is not part of the Commonwealth. If the trend continues 10% of the army will be from Commonwealth countries before 2012. The cap is in place as some fear the army's British character is being diluted, and employing too many could make the army seen as employing mercenaries.2008 The minimum recruitment age is 16years (after the end of GCSEs), although soldiers may not serve on operations below 18years; the maximum recruitment age was raised in January 2007 from 26 to 33years. The normal term of engagement is 22years, and, once enlisted, soldiers are not normally permitted to leave until they have served at least 4years.2007There has been a strong and continuing tradition of recruiting from Ireland including what is now the Republic of Ireland. Over 200,000 Irish soldiers fought in the First World War. More than 60,000 Irishmen from what was then the Irish Free State (now the Republic of Ireland) and 38,000 from Northern Ireland served in the Second World War, all volunteered.Oath of allegianceright|Troops of the Grenadier Guards on guard at Buckingham Palace.

Instead, the Army has different flags and ensigns, some for the entire army and many for the different regiments and corps. The official flag of the Army as a whole is the Union Flag, flown in a ratio of 3:5. A non-ceremonial flag also exists, which is used at recruiting events, military events and exhibitions. It also flies from the Ministry of Defence building in Whitehall.Whilst at war, the Union Flag is always used, and this flag represents the Army on The Cenotaph at Whitehall in London (the UK's memorial to its war dead).The British Army has throughout its history operated ships, ports and myriad boats. Boats, landing craft and ports are still operated by the Army and ensigns exists for vessels commanded by the Army. The Royal Logistic Corps operates a large fleet of vessels from its base at Marchwood near Southampton. The Royal Engineers has had fleets since the introduction of diving in 1838 and was granted an ensign following the foundation of the Royal Engineers Submarine Mining Service in 1871, where it operated sea mine laying ships, before transfer of the trade to the Royal Navy. The Corps maintains a Blue Ensign defaced by the crest of the Board of Ordnance from where the Corps developed, which it flies from its fleet and shore establishments that routinely operate boats.Each Foot Guards and line regiment (excluding The Rifles and Royal Gurkha Rifles (RGR)) also has its own flags, known as Colours—normally a Regimental Colour and a Queen's Colour. The design of different Regimental Colours vary but typically the colour has the Regiment's badge in the centre.

The origins are obscure but most probably derive from a specimen army form circulated by the Adjutant-General Sir Harry Calvert to all units in 1815 where the blanks had been filled in with the particulars of a Private Thomas Atkins, No 6 Company, 23rd Regiment of Foot. German soldiers in both world wars would usually refer to their British opponents as ''Tommys''. Present-day British soldiers are often referred to as ''Toms'' or just ''Tom''. The British Army magazine ''Soldier'' has a regular cartoon strip, ''Tom'', featuring the everyday life of a British soldier. Outside the services, soldiers are generally known as ''squaddies'' by the British popular press, and the general public.2010Another nickname which applies only to soldiers in Scottish regiments is ''Jock'', derived from the fact that in Scotland the common Christian name John is often changed to Jock in the vernacular.Welsh soldiers are occasionally referred to as ''Taffy'' or just ''Taff''. This may only apply to those from the Taff-Ely Valley in South Wales, where a large portion of men, left unemployed from the decline of the coal industry in the area, enlisted during the First and Second World Wars. Alternatively, it is derived from the supposed Welsh pronunciation of ''Dafydd''—the vernacular form of Dave or Davey, the patron Saint of Wales being Saint David. As a nickname for the Welsh it has existed since 1699.2013Junior officers in the army, especially those from a privileged background, are sometimes known as ''Ruperts'' by the Other ranks.2013 This nickname is believed to have been derived from the children's comic book character Rupert Bear who epitomises traditional public school values and from the purported preponderance of that particular forename amongst young men from a public school background.See alsoBritish Army* Army Cadet Force (ACF)* ArmyNET* British Army order of precedence* British Army uniform* British campaign medals* British military history* Future of the British Army (Army 2020)* Jankers (army punishments)* List of British Army installations* Ministry of Defence* Modern equipment of the British Army* Redcoat* Royal Air Force* Royal Navy* Sexual orientation and military service* Army Reserve (United Kingdom)* United Kingdom Special Forces* Volunteer ForceNotes4References30emBibliography*****************************Further reading**External linksBritish ArmyArmy
