old discussionIs "Version 3 UNIX" supposed to be "3rd edition UNIX"? That would be approximately the right time frame, though i would have thought maybe 4th or 5th edition. Adding a date would help too.----As I understand it, versions corresponded to software releases, editions corresponded to documentation (manual releases).  There wasn't always a one-to-one correspondence to each other.  --drj----The naming scheme for UNIX was relatively linear until above Version 7 Unix, which is wheremajor source trees, both inside and outside Bell Labs began to split off.This UNIX timeline has some excellent linked sources, and names and dates the various Unix versions.These sources date AWK to January 1979.Lent 18:46, 30 March 2006 (UTC)----This article could really do with some simple examples to show the expressive power of the language. IMHO, it's easier than PERL for many simple data manipulation tasks. Any objections?  - Steve Donovan----Is awk really feature complete enough to be considered a general purpose programming languagE? I've always considered it more of a text manipulation language. Suppafly 01:47, 7 Oct 2004 (UTC):That's what K ; R thought at first. But when they saw people using it as a general purpose language, they revised awk (calling it nawk) adding more features and functions. It can be used as a general purpose language. ;mdash;Pelladon 07:21, 4 August 2006 (UTC)Yes, it is.  It particularly excels at text manipulation, but is also a fine tool forother things, and in any case 'text manipulation' covers a lot of territory (the majority of dynamic web content, for example).  It's not unusual to find quite large awk programs.  - jhdIf you are in any doubt, you should look for the first editions of the excellent little books, "Programming Pearls" and "More Programming Pearls" by Jon Bentley which really show what AWK can do in the hands of an expert. -- Derek Ross | Talk 07:18, 17 November 2005 (UTC)----A simple example (about 200 lines) of a fully working tool that also demonstrates AWK is a used for more than text manipulation can be seen in the TLDP web correlator which takes in an Apache HTTP Server log and generates an HTML report.I read somewhere that AWK was initially made for database purposes.Name of the articleWhy is this page called "AWK programming language"? I've never seen awk referred to as "AWK", as if it were an acronym (even though I suppose it is). It's always just "awk". Why not change it to "Awk programming language" and chalk up the capital letter to technical restrictions? Makaristos 05:36, 14 December 2005 (UTC): Both capitalized and lower case forms are commonly used. Brian Kerningham seems to prefer . Amnonc 16:27, 14 December 2005 (UTC)::Then still, why is it called "AWK programming language" instead of just "AWK"? Also, in the article, both AWK and Awk are used. IMHO, we should stick to one capitalization and only mention the alternative somewhere. Qwertyus 17:06, 14 December 2005 (UTC):::No, you're right, Amnonc. Even awk;/tt;'s own manpage refers to it as the AWK Programming Language. awk;/tt;, all lowercase letters, is the UNIX program that runs programs in the AWK programming langauge. I stand humbled and corrected, and shall therefore attempt to make this distinction clear, as well as standardize the differing appelations in the article. Makaristos 02:36, 15 December 2005 (UTC)----Add a quick note to say that awk uses "extended regexps" by default while grep/ed/sed have "basic regexps" by default on most (all?) platforms? 70.82.141.92 13:13, 25 March 2006 (UTC):I added a line. If you see other things to be improved, be bold. Thanks, Tom Harrison Talk 14:52, 25 March 2006 (UTC)Warts:I added this section as well as the shebang section.  Is this too much text and shouldthe article be split? Lent 16:59, 30 March 2006 (UTC)CriticismsThe whole article seems to be quite a mess, but the "criticisms" section seems to be specially bad. Most items there are either completely POV, factually incorrect, or affect only specific versions of AWK. If no one complains I think I will remove the whole section, I think there are a few bits there that are valid, but they are rather minnor, would need sourcing and can be more easily added afterwards. --Lost Goblin 14:15, 8 June 2006 (UTC):Agree, I was going to suggest the same. Qwertyus 10:53, 8 June 2006 (UTC):I wrote most of it and I am also not quite happy with how it fits in. There is one reason why it might still be justified to keep it: Too many misconceptions about what AWK really is and what it isnt are circulating. Look at the list of topics in this "Editing" section. Someone had doubts that AWK was a "real programming" language. Someone else seriously took Kernighan's AWK web page at Bell Labs for a simple "book advert". As long as such nonsense gets written down here, there must be some place where this nonsense is corrected. Jürgen Kahrs 22:00, 17 June 2006 (UTC):: I'm not sure how the current criticisms sections helps there, I think it adds more to the confusion. As no one has objected so far, I'm removing it, if someone likes they can try to come up with something more clear and consistent. --Lost Goblin 01:23, 10 July 2006 (UTC)External linksThe first link takes me to a book advert. There must be good tutorials to link to. --82.15.46.131 16:07, 10 June 2006 (UTC): It is not "a book advert", it is the homepage of the AWK bible, equivalent to what K;R is for C. Actually that book probably deserves its own wikipedia article, seems to be the only book by BWK not to have its own wikipedia article and it is as significant as the others. --Lost Goblin 22:52, 10 June 2006 (UTC)LogoThe "official" AWK logo can be found on the cover of the book "The AWK Programming Language". You cam find the cover on Kernighan's "book advert" page. Is this good enough ?

This article is also categorized as a DSL. However, the first line states it's a general purpose language. There should be some clarification on both pages.

So AWK's relationship to the bird has the status of a pun. TEDickey (talk) 16:28, 31 August 2012 (UTC):It's more subtle than that.  AWK was created in an age when software projects didn't have logos like they do today.  However, the ''AWK Programming Language'' book that was published by the authors of the language features the bird on the cover, as does Arnold Robbins' ''Effective AWK Programming''.  These are the two standard references.  The auk bird has a status much like the Perl Camel, and no one will argue that that animal is a pun or "not official", or something.

The images used for those books have restrictions on their reuse because they're used as part of advertising (and this topic wouldn't meet the guidelines for incorporating that material because it is not dealing directly with the book).  Introducing yet another image doesn't help the reader, since it doesn't have any relationship to the books.  Not all books on awk use that image, e.g,. , and [this copy of Arnold's book ''GAWK: Effective AWK Programming''].

It is used for programs [of this scale], which are complex enough, depending on your opinion. Perl competes with Awk for "market share" but so do many others. They all have pros and cons and incredibly some people program in more than one language. Awk could not have peaked in the 80s, prior to the invention of Linux, when it was deployed on millions of installs during the 1990s and 2000s. It's only true for certain people born in certain years ie. I remember when Awk was the new thing, and ignores the bulk of users who experienced Awk for the first time in the 90s and 00s (when the O'Reilly books were published). A check of Stack Exchange and Unix.com shows Awk is as alive and well as ever. A check of Awk development (for GNU) shows it has seen more new features added in the past 4 years than in the prior 15.

A review by a ''knowledgeable'' reviewer of several implementations ''would'' be a reliable source.  The problem with using bug-reports is two-fold: (a) the source is ''selective'' (chosen to illustrate a point), and (b) a large percentage of bug-reports simply are invalid, or consist largely of irrelevant information which the developer must study to get ''useful'' information.  Thus it requires the knowledgeable review to make it suitable for use in sources. TEDickey (talk) 01:04, 2 September 2015 (UTC)
