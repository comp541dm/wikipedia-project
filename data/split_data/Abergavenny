Y Fenni cheese'''Abergavenny''' (Y Fenni), meaning ''Mouth of the River Gavenny'', is a market town in Monmouthshire, Wales.  It is located 15 miles (24km) west of Monmouth on the A40 and A465 roads, 6 miles (10km) from the English border. Originally the site of a Roman fort, ''Gobannium'', it became a medieval walled town within the Welsh Marches. The town contains the remains of a medieval stone castle built soon after the Norman conquest of Wales.Abergavenny is promoted as the "Gateway to Wales". Situated at the confluence of a tributary stream, the Gavenny, and the River Usk, it is almost surrounded by two mountains – the Blorenge (559m)Geograph British Isles – [The Blorenge from the B4598 road at Ty'r-pwll] and the Sugar Loaf (596m)Geograph British Isles – [River Usk with Sugar Loaf in background] – and five hills: Ysgyryd Fawr (The Skirrid), Ysgyryd Fach (Skirrid Fach), Deri, Rholben and Mynydd Llanwenarth, known locally as "Llanwenarth Breast". It provides access to the nearby Black Mountains and the Brecon Beacons National Park. The Offa's Dyke Path is close by and the Marches Way, the Beacons Way and Usk Valley Walk all pass through the town.HistoryOrigins of the town and its namePart of Abergavenny and Skirrid Fach (Little Skirrid) seen from the castle ruinsThe name derives from a Brythonic word ''Gobannia'' meaning "river of the blacksmiths", and relates to the town's pre-Roman importance in iron smelting. The name is related to the modern Welsh word ''gof'' (blacksmith), and so is also associated with the Welsh smith ''Gofannon'' from folklore. The river later became, in Welsh, ''Gafenni'', and the town's name became Abergavenny, meaning "mouth of (Welsh: ''Aber'') the Gavenny (''Gafenni'')".  In Welsh, the shortened form ''Y Fenni'' may have come into use for a very short period after about the 15th century, although pronounced similarly in English or Welsh the English spelling Abergavenny is in general use.Roman periodGobannium was a Roman fort guarding the road along the valley of the River Usk,EBwhich linked the legionary fortress of ''Burrium'' (Usk) and later ''Isca Augusta'' or Isca Silurum, (Caerleon) in the south with Y Gaer, Brecon and Mid Wales. It was also built to keep the peace among the local British Iron Age tribe, the Silures.Remains of the walls of this fort were discovered west of the castle when excavating the foundations for a new post office and telephone exchange building in the late 1960s.11th centuryAbergavenny grew as a town in early Norman times under the protection of the Lords of Abergavenny. The first Baron was Hamelin de Balun, from Ballon, a small town and castle in Maine-Anjou called "Gateway to Maine", near Le Mans, today in the Sarthe ''département'' of France. He founded the Benedictine priory, now the Priory Church of St Mary, in the late 11th century. The Priory belonged originally to the Benedictine foundation of St. Vincent Abbaye at Le Mans. It was subsequently endowed by William de Braose, with a tenth or ''"tithe"'' of the profits of the castle and town. The church contains some unique alabaster effigies, church monuments and unique medieval wood carving, such as the Tree of Jesse.12th and 13th centuriesOwing to its geographical location, the town was frequently embroiled in the border warfare and power play of the 12th and 13th centuries in the Welsh Marches. In 1175, Abergavenny Castle was the site of the Massacre. Reference to a market at Abergavenny is found in a charter granted to the Prior by William de Braose (d. 1211).15th to 17th centuriesAbergavenny and Holy Mountain in the 1890sOwain Glyndŵr attacked Abergavenny in 1404. According to popular legend, his raiders gained access to the walled town with the aid of a local woman who sympathised with the rebellion, letting a small party in via the Market Street gate at midnight. They were able to open the gate and allow a much larger party who set fire to the town and plundered its churches and homes leaving Abergavenny Castle intact. Market Street has been referred to as ''Traitors' Lane'' thereafter. In 1404 Abergavenny was declared its own nation by Ieuan ab Owain Glyndŵr, illegitimate son of Owain Glyndŵr. The arrangement lasted approximately two weeks.At the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1541, the priory's endowment went towards the foundation of a free grammar school, King Henry VIII Grammar School, the site itself passing to the Gunter family.During the Civil War, prior to the siege of Raglan Castle in 1645, King Charles I visited Abergavenny and presided in person over the trial of Sir Trefor Williams, 1st Baronet of Llangibby, a Royalist who changed sides, and other Parliamentarians.In 1639, Abergavenny received a charter of incorporation under the title of bailiff and burgesses. A charter with extended privileges was drafted in 1657, but appears never to have been enrolled or to have come into effect. Owing to the refusal of the chief officers of the corporation to take the oath of allegiance to William III in 1688, the charter was annulled, and the town subsequently declined in prosperity. Chapter 28 of the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|1535 Act of Henry VIII, which provided that Monmouth, as county town, should return one burgess to Parliament, further stated that other ancient Monmouthshire boroughs were to contribute towards the payment of the member. In consequence of this clause Abergavenny on various occasions shared in the election, the last instance being in 1685.The right to hold two weekly markets and three yearly fairs, beginning in the 13th century, was held ever since as confirmed in 1657. Abergavenny was celebrated for the production of Welsh flannel, and also for the manufacture, whilst the fashion prevailed, of goats' hair periwigs.19th and 20th centuriesAbergavenny Boys National School c. 1865Abergavenny railway station opened 2 January 1854 by the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway.  The London North Western Railway sponsored the construction of the railway linking Newport station to Hereford station.

WW2 People's War – [Marjorie's War]Baron of AbergavennyThe title of Baron Abergavenny, in the Nevill family, dates from Edward Nevill, 3rd Baron Bergavenny (d. 1476), who was the youngest son of Ralph de Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland by his second wife Joan Beaufort, daughter of John of Gaunt, first Duke of Lancaster.

It subsequently passed down in the Hanbury Williams family until it was demolished in 1954.Welsh languageIn recent decades the number of Welsh speakers in the town has increased dramatically.
