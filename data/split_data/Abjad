Abjad numeralsAn '''abjad''' is a type of writing system where each symbol stands for a consonant, leaving the reader to supply the appropriate vowel.It is a term suggested by Peter T. Daniels1996 to replace the common terms "'''consonantary'''", "'''consonantal alphabet'''" or "syllabary" to refer to the family of scripts called West Semitic.EtymologyThe name "abjad" (''abjad'' ) is derived from pronouncing the first letters of the ''Arabic'' alphabet in order. The ordering ('''') of Arabic letters used to match that of the older Hebrew, Phoenician and Semitic alphabets; ''''.TerminologyAccording to the formulations of Daniels,1996 abjads differ from alphabets in that only consonants, not vowels, are represented among the basic graphemes. Abjads differ from abugidas, another category defined by Daniels, in that in abjads, the vowel sound is ''implied'' by phonology, and where vowel marks exist for the system, such as nikkud for Hebrew and harakat|ḥarakāt for Arabic, their use is optional and not the dominant (or literate) form. Abugidas mark the vowels (other than the "inherent" vowel) with a diacritic, a minor attachment to the letter, or a standalone glyph. Some abugidas use a special symbol to ''suppress'' the inherent vowel so that the consonant alone can be properly represented. In a syllabary, a grapheme denotes a complete syllable, that is, either a lone vowel sound or a combination of a vowel sound with one or more consonant sounds.The antagonism of abjad versus alphabet, as it was formulated by Daniels, has been rejected by other scholars because abjad is also used as a term not only for the Arabic numeral system but, which is most important in terms of historical grammatology, also as term for the alphabetic device (i.e. letter order) of ancient Northwest Semitic scripts in opposition to the 'south Arabian' order. This caused fatal effects on terminology in general and especially in (ancient) Semitic philology. Also, it suggests that consonantal alphabets, in opposition to for instance the Greek alphabet, were not yet true alphabets and not yet entirely complete, lacking something important to be a fully working script system. It has also been objected that, as a set of letters, an alphabet is not the mirror of what should be there in a language from a phonemic or even phonological point of view, rather, it is the data stock of what provides maximum efficiency with least effort from a semantic point of view.2011OriginsImage:Ba`alat.png|thumb|upright=1.10|A specimen of Proto-Sinaitic script containing a phrase which may mean 'to Baalat'. The line running from the upper left to lower right reads ''mt l bclt''.History of the alphabet#Descendants of the Aramaic abjadThe first abjad to gain widespread usage was the Phoenician abjad. Unlike other contemporary scripts, such as Cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs, the Phoenician script consisted of only about two dozen symbols.  This made the script easy to learn, and Phoenician seafaring merchants took the script wherever they went.The Phoenician abjad was a radical simplification of phonetic writing, since hieroglyphics required the writer to pick a heiroglyph starting with the same phoneme that the writer wants to write in order to write phonetically, much like how ''Man'yōgana|man'yougana'' (Chinese characters, or kanji, used solely for phonetic use) was used to represent Japanese phonetically before the invention of kana.Phoenician gave way to a number of new writing systems, including the Greek alphabet and Aramaic, a widely used abjad. The Greek alphabet evolved into the modern western alphabets, such as Latin and Cyrillic, while Aramaic became the ancestor of many modern abjads and abugidas of Asia.The impure abjadsImage:Arabic albayancalligraphy.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|"Al-'Arabiyya", lit. "Arabic." An example of the Arabic script, which is an impure abjad."Impure" abjads have characters for some vowels, optional vowel diacritics, or both. The term "pure" abjad refers to scripts entirely lacking in vowel indicators.2013 However, most modern abjads, such as Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic and Avestan, are "impure" abjads, that is, they also contain symbols for some of the vowel phonemes, although the said non-diacritic vowel letters are also used to write certain consonants, particularly approximants that sound similar to long vowels. An example of a "pure" abjad is (perhaps) very early forms of ancient Phoenician, though at some point (at least by the 9th century BC) it and most of the contemporary Semitic abjads had begun to overload a few of the consonant symbols with a secondary function as vowel markers, called ''matres lectionis''. This practice was at first rare and limited in scope, but it became increasingly common and more developed in later times.Addition of vowelsGreek alphabetIn the 9th century BC, the Greeks adapted the Phoenician script for use in their own language. The phonetic structure of the Greek language created too many ambiguities when the vowels went unrepresented, so the script was modified. They did not need letters for the guttural sounds represented by ''aleph'', ''he'', ''heth'' or ''ayin'', so these symbols were assigned vocalic values. The letters ''waw'' and ''yod'' were also adapted into vowel signs; along with ''he'', these were already used as ''matres lectionis'' in Phoenician. The major innovation of Greek was to dedicate these symbols exclusively and unambiguously to vowel sounds that could be combined arbitrarily with consonants. (As opposed to syllabaries such as Linear B which usually have vowel symbols but cannot combine them with consonants to form arbitrary syllables.)Abugidas developed along a slightly different route. The basic consonantal symbol was considered to have an inherent "a" vowel sound. Hooks or short lines attached to various parts of the basic letter modify the vowel. In this way, the South Arabian alphabet evolved into the Ge'ez alphabet between the 5th century BC and the 5th century AD. Similarly, around the 3rd century BC, the Brāhmī script developed (from the Aramaic abjad, it has been hypothesized).The other major family of abugidas, Canadian Aboriginal syllabics, was initially developed in the 1840s by missionary and linguist James Evans for the Cree and Ojibwe languages. Evans used features of Devanagari script and Pitman shorthand to create his initial abugida. Later in the 19th century, other missionaries adapted Evans' system to other Canadian aboriginal languages. Canadian syllabics differ from other abugidas in that the vowel is indicated by rotation of the consonantal symbol, with each vowel having a consistent orientation.Abjads and the structure of Semitic languagesThe abjad form of writing is well-adapted to the morphological structure of the Semitic languages it was developed to write. This is because words in Semitic languages are formed from a root consisting of (usually) three consonants, the vowels being used to indicate inflectional or derived forms.  For instance, according to Classical Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic, the Arabic root  '''' (to slaughter) can be derived the forms  '''' (he slaughtered),  '''' (you (masculine singular) slaughtered),  '''' (he slaughtered),  '''' (he slaughters), and  '''' (slaughterhouse). In most cases, the absence of full glyphs for vowels makes the common root clearer, allowing readers to guess the meaning of unfamiliar words from familiar roots (especially in conjunction with context clues) and improving word recognition while reading for practiced readers.;;Comparative chart of Abjads, extinct and extant{|class="wikitable sortable"|-!
