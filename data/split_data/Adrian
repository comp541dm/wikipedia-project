'''Adrian''' is a form of the Latin given name ''Adrianus'' or ''Hadrianus''. Its ultimate origin is most likely via the former river Adria from the Venetic and Illyrian word ''adur'', meaning 'sea' or 'water'. The Adria was until the 8th century BC the main channel of the Po River into the Adriatic Sea but ceased to exist before the 1st century BC. Hecataeus of Miletus (c.550 - c.476 BC) asserted that both the Etruscan harbor city of Adria and the Adriatic Sea had been named after it., pp. 241-3 Emperor Hadrian's family was named after the city or region of Adria/Hadria, now Atri, in Picenum, which most likely started as an Etruscan or Greek colony of the older harbor city of the same name. ;;Several saints and six popes have borne this name, including the only English pope, Adrian IV, and the only Dutch pope, Adrian VI. As an English name, it has been in use since the Middle Ages though it was not popular until modern times.Religion* Pope Adrian I (c. 700-795)* Pope Adrian II (792–872)* Pope Adrian III (died 885)* Pope Adrian IV (c. 1100–1159), English pope* Pope Adrian V (c. 1205–1276)* Pope Adrian VI (1459–1523), Dutch pope* Adrian of Batanea (died 308), Christian martyr and saint* Adrian of Canterbury (died 710), scholar and Abbot of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury* Adrian of Castello (1460–1521), Italian cardinal and writer* Adrian of May (died 875), Scottish saint from the Isle of May, martyred by Vikings* Adrian of Moscow (1627–1700), last pre-revolutionary Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia* Adrian of Nicomedia (died 306), martyr and Herculian Guard of the Roman Emperor Galerius Maximian* Adrian of Ondrusov (died 1549), Russian Orthodox saint and wonder-worker* Adrian of Poshekhonye (died 1550), Russian Orthodox saint, hegumen of Dormition monastery in Yaroslavl region* Adrian Fortescue (1476–1539), English courtier at Henry VIII's court, beatified as a Roman Catholic martyr* Adrian Gouffier de Boissy (1479–1523), French Roman Catholic bishop and cardinal* Adrian Kivumbi Ddungu (1923–2009), Ugandan Roman Catholic bishop* Adrian Leo Doyle (born 1936), Australian prelate of the Roman Catholic ChurchGovernment, politics, military* Adrian Amstutz (born 1953), Swiss politician* Adrian Bailey (born 1949), British Labour Co-operative politician* Adrian von Bubenberg (1434–1479), Bernese knight, military commander and mayor* Adrian Carton de Wiart (1880–1963), Belgian-born British Army officer* Adrian Cole (1895–1966), Australian World War I flying ace* Adrian Fenty (born 1970), American politician, mayor of Washington D.C.* Adrian Hasler (born 1964), Liechtenstein politician* Adrian Johns (born 1951), English governor of Gibraltar and former senior officer in the Royal Navy* Adrian Năstase (born 1950), Romanian politician* Adrian von Renteln (1897–1946), Nazi commander in Lithuania* Adrian M.
