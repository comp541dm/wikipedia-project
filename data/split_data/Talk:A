Its name must have corresponded closely to the Hebrew or Arabic aleph."Its name "must have?" Really? Because if it "must have," then it did.  This should be replaced with "may have" or "likely" or something like this, unless the point is definite, in which case "must have" should just be removed.User:Yesitsraining|"Yes...;/font;User talk:Yesitsraining|It's Raining;/font;" 01:32, 17 December 2010 (UTC)SourceA, a is the first letter of our alphabet.  It was the first letter in the first known alphabet, which dates from about 1850 B.C.  It was used by a people called Seirites, who lived on the Sinai Peninsula north of the Red Sea.  They took this letter from Egyptian drawings of the head of an ox.  The Phoenicians, who lived in the eastern Mediterranean area, also made A the first letter in their alphabet.  They named it aleph, which means ox.  The Phoenician A looked less like an ox head, and more like the A of the present-day alphabet.  The Greeks took the letter into their alphabet and called it alpha.  They made slight changes in its shape.  The shape of the letter was changed again when it passed into the Roman alphabet.In the Seirite and Phoenician alphabets, A stood for a light breathing sound, which was not used in pronouncing the letter in the later alphabets.  A stands for six main sounds in the English alphabet.  Examples of these sounds are found in the words name, bare, man, father, water, and want.The World Book Encyclopedia. Copyright 1956.

Hunter|contribs) 13:32, 20 January 2012 (UTC)"forms/script"?About  revert of an edit of mine by User:Salamurai: yes, I am aware that this "forms/script" thing currently is on all the Latin alphabet articles, and I didn't get around removing it from all of them at once. It was added there by somebody a couple of weeks ago, without discussion as far as I can see (). I find it problematic on several levels at once:# First, technically. As far as I'm aware '' (or 'style="font-family:script;""') is not a standardized, commonly understood generic font type, such as "serif" or "sans-serif". Maybe a user has a font called "script" installed; maybe some browsers on some systems can pick out some system-specific font for that description, but it's not standardized and it can't be expected to work on all systems. The thing is not that I "need to update my fonts" as you so kindly put it (I can assure you I have a pretty large collection of fonts on my machine); the thing is that Wikipedia ought not to rely on assumptions about users' systems that are not based on clearly defined standards.# Second, even if this descriptor could be relied upon to successfully select some "script" font, how predictably similar would they be? Can you be sure the reader is really going to see the kind of glyph you were thinking of? If you want to show the reader a specific type of glyph stylization of a letter, the only safe bet is still to show them an image of it.# Third, content-wise: why this particular emphasis on "script" glyphs? (Whatever they are supposed to be.) Why not the blackletter glyphs? The italic? The Caroline minuscule? The Roman uncial? The Kurrent? The Insular?# Fourth, presentation: what is "forms/script" even supposed to mean? What is that strange slash doing there? Is the first pair of symbols following supposed to be the "forms", and the second pair the "script"? What kind of logical contrast is that? And why are the "script" forms also printed in double ?As for the other thing that got caught up in the same edit, the alleged plural form "aes", did you actually look up the OED reference? The OED gives this spelling as one out of three ("The plural has been written aes , A's , As."), and then has a whopping single example where it actually occurred (somewhere in Tennyson). This is an extremely marginal form, for all I can see, certainly a lot less common than, for instance, "a's". I'm sure I've never come across it. Has anybody else? Having this oddity mentioned in the lead sentence strikes me as a rather crass form of undue weight.:The plurals are not easy to find, because people confuse the letter with its name. These are the plurals of the names. The others are plurals of the letter. The plural of hundred isn't "100's", it's "hundreds". The plural of gamma isn't "γ's", it's "gammas". Etc. The plural forms of the letters aren't very common, but they do exist, especially in initialisms like "emcees" and "deejays", but also where objects are named after letters, like ems, els, wyes, etc, or sounds are so named, as in dropping your aitches. Should we include the plurals of some letter names but not of others, based on some arbitrary cut-off of how common they are? — kwami (talk) 04:44, 21 February 2013 (UTC):: (Late response:) I must confess I am puzzled by this alleged distinction between a "plural of a letter" and a "plural of its name", and I have "fact"-tagged the relevant footnote accordingly. The OED, which is ostensibly cited at that point, certainly isn't making such a distinction, and I must say I have no idea what the distinction should be in the first place. Could you please provide a definition and some real-life examples what kinds of usage you would consider to constitute a "plural of the name" as opposed to a "plural of the letter" itself? Also, if such a distinction can be semantically maintained (which I doubt), is there any evidence that real-life orthographic practice actually distinguishes between them? I'd be quite surprised if it did, given its esoteric nature. About the examples you offered above, "drop one's aitches" is used alternatingly with "drop one's H's", so I fail to see such a systematic distinction. "Deejays" is not a plural of a letter name, but a plural of a simple noun that happens to be a lexicalized spelling out of an initialism; such cases are very much individually lexicalized and hardly a productive property of the individual letter names as such. Can you provide any concrete examples involving things like "aes" and "ees"? Fut.Perf. User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise|☼ 15:18, 26 May 2013 (UTC):::The OED also has "a per se aes" as the plural of "a per se a" (the letter 'a' standing by itself as the word 'a').:::You'll see two conventions for writing letters:  A's, b's, c's, etc, and aes, bees, cees, etc. (Both series are often capitalized.)  These are analogous to 1's, 2's, 3's, etc. and ones, twos, threes, etc.  That is, the plural of "Y" is "Y's", but the plural of "wye" is "wyes".
