The names of individual archbishops after 1418, as well as the years of their respective reigns, are stamped on Livonian pennies excavated at archaeological sites. In many cases, this is the only biographical data available. No Livonian pennies before 1418 have been found.See also*Bishopric of Courland*Bishopric of Dorpat*Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek*Bishopric of Reval*Livonian Crusade*Livonian Brothers of the Sword*Monastic state of the Teutonic KnightsExternal links* More information about the role of the Archbishopric of Riga in the history of coinage is available at [''Medieval Livonian Numismatics'' by William Urban]*[Archbishopric of Riga] ([Archived] 2009-10-25)*[Rīgas arhibīskapija (1255-1562)]*[Rīgas bīskapija un virsbīskapija]References
