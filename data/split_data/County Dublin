Dublin (disambiguation)'''County Dublin''' ( or ''Contae Átha Cliath'') is a county in Ireland. It is conterminous with the Dublin Region and is in the province of Leinster. It is named after the city of Dublin, which is the regional capital and the capital city of Ireland. County Dublin was one of the first parts of Ireland to be shired by John, King of England following the Norman invasion of Ireland.Prior to 1994 County Dublin was also an administrative unit covering the whole county outside of Dublin City Council. In 1994 Dublin County Council was abolished and replaced with three separate administrative county councils: Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin.The population of the county was 1,273,069 according to the census of 2011., Central Statistics Office. Retrieved 6 Dec 2015Local government and politicsThere are four local authorities whose remit collectively encompasses the geographic area of the county and city of Dublin. These are Dublin City Council, South Dublin County Council, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Fingal County Council.There is also Dublin Regional Authority which has authority over the while county but this body has few powers. It consists of 30 representatives who meet once per month.[Irish Region Office - Regions of Ireland: Dublin Region] These representatives are nominated from the four administrative councils of the region. Like each Regional Authority, it is assisted in its duties by an Operational Committee and EU Operational Committee."IrishRegionOffice"Dublin Region{| class="wikitable"|-!colspan=2|Name!Area!Populationcensus2011|-| 1| Dublin City|| 527,612|-| 2| Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown|| 206,261|-| 3| Fingal|| 273,991|-| 4| South Dublin|| 265,205|}Prior to the enactment of the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1993, the county was a unified whole even though it was administered by two local authorities - Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation. Since the enactment of the Local Government Act 2001 in particular, the geographic area of the county has been divided between three entities at the level of "county" and a further entity at the level of "city". They rank equally as first level local administrative units of the NUTS 3 Dublin Region for Eurostat purposes. There are 34 LAU 1 entities in the Republic of Ireland. Each local authority is responsible for certain local services such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, the collection of motor taxation, local roads and social housing.The county is part of the Dublin constituency for the purposes of European elections. For elections to Dáil Éireann, the area of the county is today divided into twelve constituencies: Dublin Central (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin Central, Dublin Mid–West (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin Mid–West, Dublin North (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin North, Dublin North–Central (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin North–Central, Dublin North–East (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin North–East, Dublin North–West (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin North–West, Dublin South (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin South, Dublin South–Central (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin South–Central, Dublin South–East (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin South–East, Dublin South–West (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin South–West, Dublin West (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin West and Dún Laoghaire (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dún Laoghaire.  Together they return 47 deputies (Teachta Dála|TDs) to the Dáil.Dublin RegionFile:Ireland location map Dublin region.svg|thumb|alt=|The Dublin region of Ireland with each constituent county/city council highlighted.The '''Dublin Region''' is a NUTS Level III region of Ireland. The region is one of eight regions of the Republic of Ireland for the purposes of Eurostat statistics. Its NUTS code is IE021. It is co-extensive with the old county. The regional capital is Dublin City which is also the national capital."IrishRegionOffice"Dissolution of Dublin County CouncilFile:KILLINEY-147 (1424762996).jpg|left|240px|thumbnail|View of Killiney Bay from Killiney HillDublin County Council (which did not include the county borough of Dublin) was abolished in 1994 and the area divided among the administrative counties of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin each with its county seat. To these areas may be added the area of Dublin city which collectively comprise the Dublin Region ('''') and come under the remit of the Dublin Regional Authority.The area lost its administrative county status in 1994, with Section 9 Part 1(a) of the ''Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993'' stating that "the county shall cease to exist."Act of the Oireachtas: [Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993 (Section 9 Part 1(a))][Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993 Section 2] specifies: ''“the county”, in relation to any time before the establishment day, means the administrative county of Dublin.'' In discussing the legislation to dissolve Dublin County Council, Avril Doyle Teachta Dála|TD said, "The Bill before us today effectively abolishes County Dublin, and as one born and bred in these parts of Ireland I find it rather strange that we in this House are abolishing County Dublin. I am not sure whether Dubliners realise that that is what we are about today, but in effect that is the case."Dáil Éireann:Despite the legal status of the Dublin Region, the term "County Dublin" is still in common usage. Many organisations and sporting teams continue to organise on a "County Dublin" or "Dublin Region" basis. The area formerly known as "County Dublin" is now defined in legislation solely as the "Dublin Region" under the ''Local Government Act, 1991 (Regional Authorities) (Establishment) Order, 1993'',"r1"and this is the terminology officially used by the four Dublin administrative councils in press releases concerning the former county area. The term ''Greater Dublin Area'', which might consist of some or all of the Dublin Region along with counties of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow, has no legal standing.The latest Ordnance Survey Ireland "Discovery Series" (Third Edition 2005) 1:50,000 map of the Dublin Region, Sheet 50, shows the boundaries of the city and three surrounding counties of the region. Extremities of the Dublin Region, in the north and south of the region, appear in other sheets of the series, 43 and 56 respectively.MediaFile:Three Rock Mountain Southern Tor.jpg|thumb|Three Rock Mountain, Dublin, Ireland looking towards Bray Head* Local radio stations include 98FM, FM104, 103.2 Dublin City FM, Q102, SPIN 1038, Sunshine 106.8, TXFM, Raidió Na Life and Radio Nova.* Local newspapers include ''The Echo'', ''Northside People'', ''Southside People'' and the ''Liffey Champion''.Most of the area can receive the five main UK television channels on analogue television as well as the main Irish channels, along with Sky TV and Virgin Media Ireland cable television.Transport*'''Road:''' The major roads are the  N2, N3, N4 and N7 national primary roads, and the M1, M11 and M50 motorways.*'''Heavy rail:''' The InterCity (Iarnród Éireann)|InterCity and Commuter (Iarnród Éireann)|Commuter rail services (Iarnród Éireann).*'''Light rail:''' The Luas tram system serving Dublin City and its southern and western suburbs.*'''Rapid transit:''' The DART and the proposed Dublin Metro line.*'''Port:''' Dublin Port and Dún Laoghaire|Dún Laoghaire Harbour.*'''Air:''' Dublin International Airport.EconomyThe economy of County Dublin was identified as being the powerhouse behind the Celtic Tiger, a period of strong economic growth of the state. This resulted in the economy of the county expanding by almost 100% between the early 1990s and 2007. This growth resulted from incoming high-value industries, such as financial services and software manufacturing, as well as low-skilled retail and domestic services, which caused a shift away from older manufacturing-industry."IrishRegionOffice"This change saw high unemployment in the 1980s and early 1990s which resulted in damage to the capitals social structure."IrishRegionOffice"According to Eurostat figures for 2012, the region has GDP of €72.384 bn and a GDP per capita of €57,200 the highest on the island of Ireland (the second highest is Cork with €48,500)TransportTransport in DublinCounty Dublin is the main transport node of Ireland,"IrishRegionOffice"and contains one international airport, Dublin Airport.
