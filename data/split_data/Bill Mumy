Mumy worked again with Harris on the retrospective special ''Lost In Space: Forever'' (1998), where they reprised their roles in a scene written by Mumy (Harris rewrote his own lines). This occurred the year after the rest of the cast (including both Mumy and Harris) stated in a ''TV Guide'' article that the Sci Fi Channel planned to do a ''Lost in Space'' marathon while promoting a new movie. Harris was to appear in the planned TV movie, ''Lost in Space: The Journey Home'', but died before production started in 2002, and the production was subsequently cancelled.

Mumy noted: "I never really had too many uncomfortable moments working with any actor. I was comfortable working with most everybody. It’s just the more that Jonathan and I did together, the more he changed the character. He really changed the character of Dr. Smith himself. He really turned him from a snarling saboteur villain to this bumbling insulting kook. The more he played it for comedy, the more Irwin Allen liked it. The show really went the way that Jonathan led it. But we had great chemistry together, and we never had a bad day. We were always prepared, as was Bobby May who was inside the robot. When we had our work to do—and I think this is a very big reason [for] the way it went—they’d get us done in a couple of takes. Nobody screwed up. It was easier for the crew and it was easier for us, and people seemed to like it."[Profile], popcultureaddict.com; accessed February 15, 2015.Personal lifeMumy currently lives in Hollywood Hills with his wife, Eileen, and their two child-actor children, Seth and Liliana.PublicationMumy and co-author  Peter David published the short story, "The Black '59" (1992), in the anthology ''Shock Rock'', edited by F.
