It is the world's most populous country, with a population of over 1.35billion. The PRC is a one-party state governed by the Communist Party, with its seat of government in the capital city of Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces;;; five autonomous regions; four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing); two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau); and claims sovereignty over Taiwan.Covering approximately 9.6million square kilometers, China is the world's second-largest country by land area, and either the third or fourth-largest by total area, depending on the method of measurement. China's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from forest steppes and the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts in the arid north to subtropical forests in the wetter south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from South and Central Asia. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is mi long, and is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East and South China Seas.China is a cradle of civilization, with its known history beginning with an ancient civilization – one of the world's earliest – that flourished in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies known as dynasties. Since 221 BCE, when the Qin Dynasty first conquered several states to form a Chinese empire, the country has expanded, fractured and reformed numerous times. The Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China (ROC) replaced the last dynasty in 1912, and ruled the Chinese mainland until 1949, when it was defeated by the Communist Party of China in the Chinese Civil War. The Communist Party established the People's Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October 1949, while the ROC government relocated to Taiwan with its present capital in Taipei. Both the ROC and PRC continue to claim to be the legitimate government of all China.China had the largest economy in the world for most of the past two thousand years, during which it has seen cycles of prosperity and decline.Angus Maddison. Chinese EconomicPerformance in the Long Run. Development Centre Studies. Accessed 2007. p.29 Since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978, China has become one of the world's fastest-growing major economies. As of 2014, it is the world's second-largest economy by nominal total GDP and largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). China is also the world's largest exporter and second-largest importer of goods. China is a recognized nuclear weapons state and has the world's largest standing army and second-largest defence budget."ChineseNukes"SIPRI2014The PRC has been a United Nations member since 1971, when it replaced the ROC as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. China is also a member of numerous formal and informal multilateral organizations, including the WTO, APEC, BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the BCIM and the G-20. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.EtymologyNames of China| s| p=Zhōngguó| w=Chung1-kuo2| bpmf=ㄓㄨㄥ ㄍㄨㄛˊ| xej=ﺟْﻮ ﻗُﻮَع| tp=Jhongguó| mps=Jūng-guó| gr=Jong'gwo| poj=Tiong-kok| gan=Tung-koe̍t| hsn=/tan33 kwɛ24/| wuu=Tson平 koh入| j=Zung1 gwok3| y=Jūnggwok| h=Dung24 Gued2| buc=Dṳ̆ng-guók| hhbuc=De̤ng-go̤h| mblmc=Dô̤ng-gŏ| l=Middle Kingdom| t2| s2| p2=Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó| bpmf2=ㄓㄨㄥ ㄏㄨㄚˊ ㄖㄣˊ ㄇㄧㄣˊ ㄍㄨㄥˋ ㄏㄜˊ ㄍㄨㄛˊ| xej2=ﺟْﻮ ﺧُﻮَ ژٌ مٍ ﻗْﻮ حْ ﻗُﻮَع| poj2=Tiong-hôa jîn-bîn kiōng-hô-kok| gan2=Chungfa Ninmin Khungfokoet| wuu2=Tson平 gho平 zin平 min平 gon去 ghu平 koh入| j2=Zung1 waa4 jan4 man4 gung6 wo4 gwok3| y2=Jūngwàh Yàhnmàhn Guhngwòhgwok| hsn2=/tan33 go13 ŋin13 min13 gan45 gu13 kwɛ24/| h2=Dung24 fa11 ngin11 min11 kiung55 fo11 gued2| buc2=Dṳ̆ng-huà Ìng-mìng Gê̤ṳng-huò-guók| hhbuc2=De̤ng-huá Cíng-míng Gē̤ng-hó̤-go̤h| mblmc2=Dô̤ng-uǎ Nêng-měng Gō̤ng-uǎ-gŏ| mon=File:Mongolian-PRC2.svg|70px|alt=Bügüde nayiramdaqu dumdadu arad ulus, ᠪᠦᠭᠦᠳᠡ ᠨᠠᠶᠢᠷᠠᠮᠳᠠᠬᠤ ᠳᠤᠮᠳᠠᠳᠤ ᠠᠷᠠᠳ ᠤᠯᠤᠰ| monr=Bügüde nayiramdaqu dumdadu arad ulus| tib| wylie=krung hwa mi dmangs spyi mthun rgyal khab| zwpy=Zhunghua Mimang Jitun Gyalkab| uig=جۇڭخۇا خەلق جۇمھۇرىيىت| uly=Jungxua Xelq Jumhuriyiti| uyy| sgs=Junghua Hälk̂ Jumĥuriyiti| usy=Җуңхуа Хәлқ Җумһурийити| zha=Cunghvaz Yinzminz Gunghozgoz| order=st}}The word "China" is thought to have been originally derived from the Sanskrit word ''Chinas|Cīna'' (), which is translated into the Persian word ''Chīn'' ()."[China]".

''Decades of the New World'': "The great China whose kyng is thought the greatest prince in the world." The traditional theory, proposed in the 17th century by Martino Martini and supported by many later scholars, is that the word China and its earlier related forms are ultimately derived from the state of "Qin" (}}), the westernmost of the Chinese kingdoms during the Zhou dynasty which unified China to form the Qin dynasty.Martino, Martin, ''Novus Atlas Sinensis'', Vienna 1655, Preface, p. 2. Other suggestions for the derivation of "China" however exist.wadeThe official name of the modern country is the People's Republic of China (). The common Chinese names for the country are '''' (, from '''', "central" or "middle", and '''', "state" or "states", and in modern times, "nation") and '''' (), although the country's official name has been changed numerous times by successive dynasties and modern governments. The term '''' appeared in various ancient texts, such as the ''Classic of History'' of the 6th century BCE, and in pre-imperial times it was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia tribes from perceived "barbarians". The term, which can be either singular or plural, referred to the group of states or provinces in the central plain, but was not used as a name for the country as a whole until the nineteenth century. The Chinese were not unique in regarding their country as "central", with other civilizations having the same view of themselves.HistoryTimeline of Chinese historyPrehistoryChinese prehistoryArchaeological evidence suggests that early hominids inhabited China between 250,000 and 2.24 million years ago.["Early Homo erectus Tools in China"].

The Shang were conquered by the Zhou, who ruled between the 11th and 5th centuries BCE, though centralized authority was slowly eroded by feudal warlords. Many independent states eventually emerged from the weakened Zhou state and continually waged war with each other in the 300-year Spring and Autumn Period, only occasionally deferring to the Zhou king.

China's total area is generally stated as being approximately . Specific area figures range from  according to the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'',  according to the UN Demographic Yearbook,"UN Stat"to  according to the CIA World Factbook.China has the longest combined land border in the world, measuring   from the mouth of the Yalu River to the Gulf of Tonkin."CIA"China borders 14 nations, more than any other country except Russia, which also borders 14. China extends across much of East Asia, bordering Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar (Burma) in Southeast Asia; India, Bhutan, Nepal and Pakistan in South Asia; Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan in Central Asia; and Russia, Mongolia, and North Korea in Inner Asia and Northeast Asia. Additionally, China shares maritime boundaries with South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and the Philippines.Landscape and climateThe territory of China lies between latitudes 18th parallel north|18° and 54th parallel north|54° N, and longitudes 73rd meridian east|73° and 135th meridian east|135° E. China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast width. In the east, along the shores of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, there are extensive and densely populated alluvial plains, while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad grasslands predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the deltas of China's two major rivers, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Other major rivers include the Xi, Mekong, Brahmaputra and Amur. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas. High plateaus feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the Taklamakan and the Gobi Desert. The world's highest point, Mount Everest (8,848m), lies on the Sino-Nepalese border. The country's lowest point, and the world's third-lowest, is the dried lake bed of Ayding Lake (−154m) in the Turpan Depression.China's climate is mainly dominated by dry seasons and wet monsoons, which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer. In the winter, northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry; in summer, southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist. The climate in China differs from region to region because of the country's highly complex topography.A major environmental issue in China is the continued expansion of its deserts, particularly the Gobi Desert..

Although barrier tree lines planted since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of sandstorms, prolonged drought and poor agricultural practices have resulted in dust storms plaguing northern China each spring, which then spread to other parts of East Asia, including Korea and Japan. China's environmental watchdog, SEPA, stated in 2007 that China is losing a million acres (4,000km²) per year to desertification. Water quality, erosion, and pollution control have become important issues in China's relations with other countries.

The causes of this Great Divergence continue to be debated.After repeated military defeats by Western nations in the 19th century, Chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology as part of the Self-Strengthening Movement. After the Communists came to power in 1949, efforts were made to organize science and technology based on the model of the Soviet Union, in which scientific research was part of central planning. After Mao's death in 1976, science and technology was established as one of the Four Modernizations, and the Soviet-inspired academic system was gradually reformed.Modern eraSince the end of the Cultural Revolution, China has made significant investments in scientific research, with $163 billion spent on scientific research and development in 2012. Science and technology are seen as vital for achieving China's economic and political goals, and are held as a source of national pride to a degree sometimes described as "techno-nationalism".

Some observers see the period following the establishment of the PRC in 1949 as a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history, while others claim that the Communist Party's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, especially through political movements such as the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s, where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed, having been denounced as "regressive and harmful" or "vestiges of feudalism". Many important aspects of traditional Chinese morals and culture, such as Confucianism, art, literature, and performing arts like Peking opera, were altered to conform to government policies and propaganda at the time. Access to foreign media remains heavily restricted.Today, the Chinese government has accepted numerous elements of traditional Chinese culture as being integral to Chinese society. With the rise of Chinese nationalism and the end of the Cultural Revolution, various forms of traditional Chinese art, literature, music, film, fashion and architecture have seen a vigorous revival, and folk and variety art in particular have sparked interest nationally and even worldwide.
