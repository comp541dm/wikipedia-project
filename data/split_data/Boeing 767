;;{||developed into}}|}The '''Boeing 767''' is a mid- to large-size, long-range, wide-body twin-engine jet airliner built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It was Boeing's first wide-body twinjet and its first airliner with a two-crew glass cockpit. The aircraft has two turbofan engines, a conventional tail, and, for reduced aerodynamic drag, a supercritical wing design. Designed as a smaller wide-body airliner than earlier aircraft such as the 747, the 767 has seating capacity for 181 to 375 persons and a design range of , depending on variant. Development of the 767 occurred in tandem with a narrow-body twinjet, the 757, resulting in shared design features which allow pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate both aircraft.The 767 is produced in three fuselage lengths. The original 767-200 entered service in 1982, followed by the 767-300 in 1986 and the 767-400ER, an extended-range (ER) variant, in 2000. The extended-range 767-200ER and 767-300ER models entered service in 1984 and 1988, respectively, while a production freighter version, the 767-300F, debuted in 1995. Conversion programs have modified passenger 767-200 and 767-300 series aircraft for cargo use, while military derivatives include the E-767 surveillance aircraft, the KC-767 and KC-46 aerial tankers, and VIP transports. Engines featured on the 767 include the General Electric CF6, Pratt ; Whitney JT9D and Pratt ; Whitney PW4000|PW4000, and Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofans.United Airlines first placed the 767 in commercial service in 1982. The aircraft was initially flown on domestic and transcontinental routes, during which it demonstrated the reliability of its twinjet design. In 1985, the 767 became the first twin-engined airliner to receive regulatory approval for extended overseas flights. The aircraft was then used to expand non-stop service on medium- to long-haul intercontinental routes. In 1986, Boeing initiated studies for a higher-capacity 767, ultimately leading to the development of the 777, a larger wide-body twinjet. In the 1990s, the 767 became the most frequently used airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe.The 767 is the first twinjet wide-body type to reach 1,000 aircraft delivered.  As of January 2016, Boeing has received 1,163 orders for the 767 from 74 customers; 1,083 have been delivered.767_O_D_summA total of 765 of these aircraft were in service in July 2015; the most popular variant is the 767-300ER, with 583 delivered; Delta Air Lines is the largest operator, with 95 aircraft. Competitors have included the Airbus A300, A310, and A330-200, while a successor, the 787 Dreamliner, entered service in October 2011.3DevelopmentBackgroundIn 1970, Boeing's 747 became the first wide-body jetliner to enter service.Eden_p102The 747 was the first passenger jet that was wide enough to feature a twin-aisle cabin.  Two years later, the manufacturer began a development study, code-named 7X7, for a new wide-body aircraft intended to replace the 707 and other early generation narrow-body jets.n157saverThe aircraft would also provide twin-aisle seating, but in a smaller fuselage than the existing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar wide-bodies.n157To defray the high cost of development, Boeing signed risk-sharing agreements with Italian corporation Aeritalia and the Civil Transport Development Corporation (CTDC), a consortium of Japanese aerospace companies. This marked the manufacturer's first major international joint venture, and both Aeritalia and the CTDC received supply contracts in return for their early participation.n156The initial 7X7 was conceived as a short take-off and landing airliner intended for short-distance flights, but customers were unenthusiastic about the concept, leading to its redefinition as a mid-size, transcontinental-range airliner. At this stage the proposed aircraft featured two or three engines, with possible configurations including over-wing engines and a T-tail.File:Delta Air Lines Boeing 767-232 Farnborough 1982 Fitzgerald.jpg|thumb|The 7X7 would make its Farnborough Airshow debut in 1982 as the 767-200.|alt=Side view of twin-engine jet touching down on runway, with deployed flaps and thrust reversers.By 1976, a twinjet layout, similar to the one which had debuted on the Airbus A300, became the baseline configuration.no20The decision to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new-generation jet powerplants. While airline requirements for new wide-body aircraft remained ambiguous,no20the 7X7 was generally focused on mid-size, high-density markets.Eden_p102As such, it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities. Advancements in civil aerospace technology, including high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines, new flight deck systems, aerodynamic improvements, and lighter construction materials were to be applied to the 7X7.n157Many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size narrow-body airliner, code-named 7N7, which would become the 757.no19Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.n143In January 1978, Boeing announced a major extension of its Everett factory—which was then dedicated to the manufacture of the 747—to accommodate its new wide-body family. In February 1978, the new jetliner received the 767 model designation, and three variants were planned: a 767-100 with 190 seats, a 767-200 with 210 seats, and a trijet 767MR/LR version with 200 seats intended for intercontinental routes.no20The 767MR/LR was subsequently renamed 777 for differentiation purposes. The 767 was officially launched on July 14, 1978, when United Airlines ordered 30 of the 767-200 variant, followed by 50 more 767-200 orders from American Airlines and Delta Air Lines later that year.n159The 767-100 was ultimately not offered for sale, as its capacity was too close to the 757's seating,n159while the 777 trijet was eventually dropped in favor of standardizing around the twinjet configuration.no20Design effortIn the late 1970s, operating cost replaced capacity as the primary factor in airliner purchases.saverAs a result, the 767's design process emphasized fuel efficiency from the outset.n157Boeing targeted a 20 to 30percent cost saving over earlier aircraft, mainly through new engine and wing technology. As development progressed, engineers used computer-aided design for over one-third of the 767's design drawings,saverand performed 26,000 hours of wind tunnel tests.n159Design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet, leading Boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost.no19Both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features, including avionics, flight management systems, instruments, and handling characteristics.no23Combined development costs were estimated at $3.5 to $4billion.saverFile:Continental Airlines Boeing 767-400ER Wallner.jpg|thumb|left|Forward view of a Continental Airlines 767-400ER, showing fuselage profile, wing dihedral, and CF6 engines|alt=Forward view of aircraft, showing fuselage profile, two circular engines.Early 767 customers were given the choice of Pratt ; Whitney JT9D or General Electric CF6 turbofans, marking the first time that Boeing had offered more than one engine option at the launch of a new airliner.no22Both jet engine models had a maximum output of kN of thrust.Eden_p103The engines were mounted approximately one-third the length of the wing from the fuselage, similar to previous wide-body trijets.saverThe larger wings were designed using an aft-loaded shape which reduced aerodynamic drag and distributed lift more evenly across their surface span than any of the manufacturer's previous aircraft.savern160The wings provided higher-altitude cruise performance, added fuel capacity, and expansion room for future stretched variants.n159The initial 767-200 was designed for sufficient range to fly across North America or across the northern Atlantic, and would be capable of operating routes up to km.The 767's fuselage width was set midway between that of the 707 and the 747 at .n157While it was narrower than previous wide-body designs, seven abreast seating with two aisles could be fitted, and the reduced width produced less aerodynamic drag.Eden_p103However, the fuselage was not wide enough to accommodate two standard LD3 wide-body unit load devices side-by-side. As a result, a smaller container, the LD2,767_airport_reportwas created specifically for the 767.  The adoption of a conventional tail design also allowed the rear fuselage to be tapered over a shorter section,no22providing for parallel aisles along the full length of the passenger cabin, and eliminating irregular seat rows toward the rear of the aircraft.saverno22File:AeroMexico Boeing 767-3Q8ER cockpit.jpg|thumb||The original two-crew 767 glass cockpit|alt=A cockpit of the 767-300ER, which exhibits a hybrid adoption of a new-generation instrument panel and analog gauges and indicators.The 767 was the first Boeing wide-body to be designed with a two-crew digital glass cockpit. Cathode ray tube (CRT) color displays and new electronics replaced the role of the flight engineer by enabling the pilot and co-pilot to monitor aircraft systems directly.no23Despite the promise of reduced crew costs, United Airlines initially demanded a conventional three-person cockpit, citing concerns about the risks associated with introducing a new aircraft.2crewThe carrier maintained this position until July 1981, when a U.S. presidential task force determined that a crew of two was safe for operating wide-body jets. A three-crew cockpit remained as an option and was fitted to the first production models. Ansett Australia ordered 767s with three-crew cockpits due to union demands; it was the only airline to operate 767s so configured.becher33The 767's two-crew cockpit was also applied to the 757, allowing pilots to operate both aircraft after a short conversion course, and adding incentive for airlines to purchase both types.introProduction and testingTo produce the 767, Boeing formed a network of subcontractors which included domestic suppliers and international contributions from Italy's Aeritalia and Japan's CTDC.n156The wings and cabin floor were produced in-house, while Aeritalia provided control surfaces, Boeing Vertol made the leading edge for the wings, and Boeing Wichita produced the forward fuselage.saverThe CTDC provided multiple assemblies through its constituent companies, namely Fuji Heavy Industries (wing fairings and gear doors), Kawasaki Heavy Industries (center fuselage), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (rear fuselage, doors, and tail).n156Components were integrated during final assembly at the Everett factory.saverFor expedited production of wing spars, the main structural member of aircraft wings, the Everett factory received robotic machinery to automate the process of drilling holes and inserting fasteners.saverThis method of wing construction expanded on techniques developed for the 747.saverFinal assembly of the first aircraft began in July 1979.Eden_p102File:Boeing 767 Everett, Washington production view.jpg|thumb|left||Final assembly of a 767-300F at Boeing's Everett factory, which was expanded for 767 production in 1978|alt=Airplane assembly hall, featuring an unpainted metallic twin-jet aircraft, a presentation podium, and arranged audience chairs.The prototype aircraft, registered N767BA and equipped with JT9D turbofans, rolled out on August 4, 1981. By this time, the 767 program had accumulated 173 firm orders from 17 customers, including Air Canada, All Nippon Airways, Britannia Airways, Transbrasil, and Trans World Airlines (TWA).saverOn September 26, 1981, the prototype took its maiden flight under the command of company test pilots Tommy Edmonds, Lew Wallick, and John Brit.n161The maiden flight was largely uneventful, save for the inability to retract the landing gear because of a hydraulic fluid leak.n161The prototype was used for subsequent flight tests.b17The 10-month 767 flight test program utilized the first six aircraft built.Eden_p102b17The first four aircraft were equipped with JT9D engines, while the fifth and sixth were fitted with CF6 engines.Eden_p103The test fleet was largely used to evaluate avionics, flight systems, handling, and performance,b50while the sixth aircraft was used for route-proving flights.testingDuring testing, pilots described the 767 as generally easy to fly, with its maneuverability unencumbered by the bulkiness associated with larger wide-body jets. Following the successful completion of 1,600 hours of flight tests, the JT9D-powered 767-200 received certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in July 1982. The first delivery occurred on August 19, 1982, to United Airlines.n161The CF6-powered 767-200 received certification in September 1982, followed by the first delivery to Delta Air Lines on October 25, 1982.Eden_p103Service entry and operationsThe 767 entered service with United Airlines on September 8, 1982.Haenggi_p31-5The aircraft's first commercial flight used a JT9D-powered 767-200 on the Chicago-to-Denver route. The CF6-powered 767-200 commenced service three months later with Delta Air Lines.Eden_p102Upon delivery, early 767s were mainly deployed on domestic routes, including U.S. transcontinental services.b49American Airlines and TWA began flying the 767-200 in late 1982, while Air Canada, China Airlines, and El Al began operating the aircraft in 1983. The aircraft's introduction was relatively smooth, with few operational glitches and greater dispatch reliability than prior jetliners. In its first year, the 767 logged a 96.1percent rate of takeoff without delay due to technical issues, which exceeded the industry average for new aircraft.smoothOperators reported generally favorable ratings for the twinjet's sound levels, interior comfort, and economic performance.smoothResolved issues were minor and included the recalibration of a leading edge sensor to prevent false readings, the replacement of an evacuation slide latch, and the repair of a tailplane pivot to match production specifications.smoothFile:Boeing 767 over Mount Rainier, circa 1980s.jpg|thumb|The first 767-200 built, N767BA, in flight near Mount Rainier in the 1980s.|alt=Boeing twin engine jetliner in flight near a snow-capped mountainSeeking to capitalize on its new wide-body's potential for growth, Boeing offered an extended-range model, the 767-200ER, in its first year of service.

In May 1985, the FAA granted its first approval for 120-minute ETOPS flights to 767 operators, on an individual airline basis starting with TWA, provided that the operator met flight safety criteria.haenggi_p38-40This allowed the aircraft to fly overseas routes at up to two hours' distance from land.haenggi_p38-40The larger safety margins were permitted because of the improved reliability demonstrated by the twinjet and its turbofan engines.haenggi_p38-40The FAA lengthened the ETOPS time to 180 minutes for CF6-powered 767s in 1989, making the type the first to be certified under the longer duration, and all available engines received approval by 1993. Regulatory approval spurred the expansion of transoceanic 767 flights and boosted the aircraft's sales.no163Stretched derivativesForecasting airline interest in larger-capacity models, Boeing announced the stretched 767-300 in 1983 and the extended-range 767-300ER in 1984.no163Eden_p104Both models offered a 20percent passenger capacity increase,767_airport_reportwhile the extended-range version was capable of operating flights up to km.763specsJapan Airlines placed the first order for the 767-300 in September 1983.no163Following its first flight on January 30, 1986, the type entered service with Japan Airlines on October 20, 1986."Boe_767_back"The 767-300ER completed its first flight on December 9, 1986,"Boe_767_back"but it was not until March 1987 that the first firm order, from American Airlines, was placed.Eden_p104The type entered service with American Airlines on March 3, 1988."Boe_767_back"The 767-300 and 767-300ER gained popularity after entering service, and came to account for approximately two-thirds of all 767s sold.no163After the debut of the first stretched 767s, Boeing sought to address airline requests for even more capacity by proposing larger models, including a partial double-deck version informally named the "Hunchback of Mukilteo" (from a town near Boeing's Everett factory) with a 757 body section mounted over the aft main fuselage.

By the end of the decade, 767s crossed the Atlantic more frequently than all other aircraft types combined. The 767 also propelled the growth of point-to-point flights which bypassed major airline hubs in favor of direct routes.Sutter_p241Taking advantage of the aircraft's lower operating costs and smaller capacity, operators added non-stop flights to secondary population centers, thereby eliminating the need for connecting flights.Sutter_p241The increase in the number of cities receiving non-stop services caused a paradigm shift in the airline industry as point-to-point travel gained prominence at the expense of the traditional hub-and-spoke model.Sutter_p241p2pIn February 1990, the first 767 equipped with Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofans, a 767-300, was delivered to British Airways. Six months later, the carrier temporarily grounded its entire 767 fleet after discovering cracks in the engine pylons of several aircraft. The cracks were related to the extra weight of the RB211 engines, which are kg heavier than other 767 engines.b64During the grounding, interim repairs were conducted to alleviate stress on engine pylon components, and a parts redesign in 1991 prevented further cracks.b64Boeing also performed a structural reassessment, resulting in production changes and modifications to the engine pylons of all 767s in service.File:Boeing 767-400ER Rollout Proctor.jpg|thumb|The Boeing 767-400ER was publicly unveiled on August 26, 1999."Boe_767_back"|alt=Side quarter view of twin-engine jetliner in front of hangar, with surrounding crowds.In January 1993, following an order from UPS Airlines, Boeing launched a freighter variant, the 767-300F, which entered service with UPS on October 16, 1995."Boe_767_back"The 767-300F featured a main deck cargo hold, upgraded landing gear, and strengthened wing structure.f63In November 1993, the Japanese government launched the first 767 military derivative when it placed orders for the E-767, an Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) variant based on the 767-200ER.b39The first two E-767s, featuring extensive modifications to accommodate surveillance radar and other monitoring equipment, were delivered in 1998 to the Japan Self-Defense Forces.aw33poiseIn November 1995, after abandoning development of a smaller version of the 777, Boeing announced that it was revisiting studies for a larger 767.no117The proposed 767-400X, a second stretch of the aircraft, offered an over 12percent capacity increase versus the 767-300,767_airport_reportand featured an upgraded flight deck, enhanced interior, and wider wingspan.

Subsequently, the 767-300ER was offered to customers affected by 787 delays, including All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines. Some aging 767s, exceeding 20 years in age, were also kept in service past planned retirement dates due to the delays. To extend the operational lives of older aircraft, airlines increased heavy maintenance procedures, including D-check teardowns and inspections for corrosion, a recurring issue on aging 767s.

"767's maiden O'Hare landing is automatic". ''Chicago Tribune'', p. 3. The 767 became the first aircraft to receive CAT IIIb certification from the FAA for landings with  minimum visibility in 1984. On the 767-400ER, the cockpit layout is simplified further with six Rockwell Collins liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, and adapted for similarities with the 777 and the Next Generation 737. To retain operational commonality, the LCD screens can be programmed to display information in the same manner as earlier 767s.f63In 2012, Boeing and Rockwell Collins launched a further 787-based cockpit upgrade for the 767, featuring three landscape-format LCD screens that can display two windows each.The 767 is equipped with three redundant hydraulic systems for operation of control surfaces, landing gear, and other equipment.b24Each engine powers a separate hydraulic system, and the third system uses electric pumps. A ram air turbine is fitted to provide power for basic controls in the event of an emergency.  An early form of fly-by-wire is employed for spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables.saverThe fly-by-wire system reduces weight and provides for the independent operation of individual spoilers.saverInteriorThe 767 features a twin-aisle cabin with a typical configuration of six abreast in business class and seven across in economy.767_airport_reportThe standard seven abreast, 2–3–2 economy class layout places approximately 87percent of all seats at a window or aisle. As a result, the aircraft can be largely occupied before center seats need to be filled,saverand each passenger is no more than one seat from the aisle.kane553It is possible to configure the aircraft with extra seats for up to an eight abreast configuration,767_airport_reportbut this results in a cramped cabin and is therefore uncommon.The 767 interior introduced larger overhead bins and more lavatories per passenger than previous aircraft.reshapedThe bins are wider to accommodate garment bags without folding, and strengthened for heavier carry-on items. A single, large galley is installed near the aft doors, allowing for more efficient meal service and simpler resupply while at airports.reshapedPassenger and service doors are an overhead plug type, which retract upwards,767_airport_reportand commonly used doors can be equipped with an electric-assist system.saverIn 2000, a 777-style interior, known as the Boeing Signature Interior, debuted on the 767-400ER. Subsequently adopted for all new-build 767s, the Signature Interior features even larger overhead bins, indirect lighting, and sculpted, curved panels. The 767-400ER also received larger windows derived from the 777. Older 767s can be retrofitted with the Signature Interior.hitSome operators have adopted a simpler modification known as the Enhanced Interior, featuring curved ceiling panels and indirect lighting with minimal modification of cabin architecture, as well as aftermarket modifications such as the NuLook 767 package by Heath Tecna.VariantsFile:G-BNWA British Airways B767-300 planform.jpg|thumb||A British Airways 767-300ER with deployed flaps after takeoff|alt=Underside view of a jet in-flight.

Six fatal crashes, including three hijackings, have resulted in a total of 851 occupant fatalities.ASN_767_hull-lossesThe airliner's first fatal crash, Lauda Air Flight 004, occurred near Bangkok on May 26, 1991, following the in-flight deployment of the left engine thrust reverser on a 767-300ER; none of the 223 aboard survived; as a result of this accident all 767 thrust reversers were deactivated until a redesign was implemented. Investigators determined that an electronically controlled valve, common to late-model Boeing aircraft, was to blame. A new locking device was installed on all affected jetliners, including 767s. On October 31, 1999, EgyptAir Flight 990, a 767-300ER, crashed off Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, in international waters killing all 217 people on board.  The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined the probable cause to be due to a deliberate action by the first officer; Egypt disputed this conclusion.  On April 15, 2002, Air China Flight 129, a 767-200ER, crashed into a hill amid inclement weather while trying to land at Gimhae International Airport in Busan, South Korea. The crash resulted in the death of 129 of the 166 people on board, and the cause was attributed to pilot error.File:Air Canada 767 C-GAUN Gimli Glider.jpg|thumb|The "Gimli Glider" parked at Mojave Air and Space Port in February 2008|alt=Side view of a parked Air Canada twin-engine jet in the desert, with stairs mounted next to the aircraft's forward door.An early 767 incident was survived by all on board. On July 23, 1983, Air Canada Flight 143, a 767-200, ran out of fuel in-flight and had to glide with both engines out for almost km to an emergency landing at Gimli, Manitoba. The pilots used the aircraft's ram air turbine to power the hydraulic systems for aerodynamic control. There were no fatalities and only minor injuries. This aircraft was nicknamed "Gimli Glider" after the airport at which it landed. The aircraft, registered C-GAUN, continued flying for Air Canada until its retirement in January 2008.

Two 767s were involved in the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, resulting in the collapse of its two main towers. American Airlines Flight 11, a 767-200ER, crashed into the north tower, killing all 92 people on board, and United Airlines Flight 175, a 767-200, crashed into the south tower, with the death of all 65 on board. In addition, more than 2,600 people were killed in the towers or on the ground. A foiled 2001 shoe bomb plot involving an American Airlines 767-300ER resulted in passengers being required to remove their shoes for scanning at U.S. security checkpoints.On November 1, 2011, LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16, a 767-300ER, safely landed at Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport in Warsaw, Poland after a mechanical failure of the landing gear forced an emergency landing with the landing gear up. There were no injuries, but the aircraft involved was damaged and subsequently written off.circuitAt the time of the incident, aviation analysts speculated that it may have been the first instance of a complete landing gear failure in the 767's service history. Subsequent investigation however determined that while a damaged hose had disabled the aircraft's primary landing gear extension system, an otherwise functional backup system was inoperative due to an accidentally deactivated circuit breaker.checklistIn January 2014, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issued a directive that ordered inspections of the elevators on more than 400 767s beginning in March 2014; the focus is on fasteners and other parts that can fail and cause the elevators to jam.  The issue was first identified in 2000 and has been the subject of several Boeing service bulletins. The inspections and repairs are required to be completed within six years.Pasztor, Andy.

Hangar renovations, begun in June 2013, are now complete, and the museum is accessible on a daily basis.In 2005, four retired American Airlines 767-200s were dismantled for parts in Roswell, New Mexico, and their nose sections removed intact for collector or film use. Of these four aircraft, the cockpit of N301AA, the eighth 767 built and the first of its type delivered to American Airlines, was transported to Victorville, California, to be restored for museum display."Scroggins Aviation Boeing 767 cockpit".
