Cape BretonNASA landsat photo of Cape Breton Island'''Cape Breton Island''' (—formerly ''Île-Royale (New France)|Île Royale'', Scottish Gaelic: ''Ceap Breatainn'' or ''Eilean Cheap Bhreatainn'', Míkmaq: ''Únamakika'', simply: ''Cape Breton'') is an island on the Atlantic coast of North America.  Its name may derive from Capbreton near Bayonne, or more probably from the word ''Breton'', the French adjective form of the proper noun ''Bretagne'', the French historical region.Cape Breton Island is part of the province of Nova Scotia, Canada.EB1911The  island accounts for 18.7% of the total area of Nova Scotia.  Although physically separated from the Nova Scotia peninsula by the Strait of Canso, it is artificially connected to mainland Nova Scotia by the   long rock-fill Canso Causeway.  The island is located east-northeast of the mainland with its northern and western coasts fronting on the Gulf of Saint Lawrence; its western coast also forming the eastern limits of the Northumberland Strait. The eastern and southern coasts front the Atlantic Ocean; its eastern coast also forming the western limits of the Cabot Strait. Its landmass slopes upward from south to north, culminating in the highlands of its northern cape. One of the world's larger salt water lakes, Bras d'Or ("Arm of Gold" in French), dominates the centre of the island.The island is divided into four of Nova Scotia's eighteen counties: Cape Breton, Inverness, Richmond, and Victoria. Their total population at the 2011 census numbered 135,974 "Cape Bretoners"; this is approximately 15% of the provincial population."Table from Statistics Canada"Cape Breton Island has experienced a decline in population of approximately 4.4% since the previous census in 2006.  Approximately 75% of the island's population is located in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality (CBRM) which includes all of Cape Breton County and is often referred to as Industrial Cape Breton, given the history of coal mining and steel manufacturing in this area, which was Nova Scotia's industrial heartland throughout the 20th century.The island contains five reserves of the Mi'kmaq Nation, these being: Eskasoni, Membertou, Wagmatcook, Waycobah, and Potlotek First Nation|Potlotek/Chapel Island. Eskasoni is the largest in both population and land area.HistoryCape Breton Island's first residents were most likely Archaic maritime natives, ancestors of the Mi'kmaq, the people who were inhabiting the island at the time of European arrival.  John Cabot reportedly visited the island in 1497.EB1911However, historians are unclear as to whether Cabot first visited Newfoundland or Cape Breton Island. This discovery is commemorated by Cape Breton's Cabot Trail, and by the ''Cabot's Landing Historic Site ; Provincial Park'', located near the village of Dingwall.In about 1521–22, the Portuguese under João Álvares Fagundes established a fishing colony on the island. As many as two hundred settlers lived in a village, the name of which is not known, located according to some historians at what is now present day Ingonish on the island's northeastern peninsula.  The fate of this Portuguese colony is unknown, but it is mentioned as late as 1570.de Souza, Francisco; ''Tratado das Ilhas Novas'', 1570During the Anglo-French War (1627–1629)|Anglo-French War of 1627 to 1629, under Charles I, by 1629 the Kirkes took Quebec City; Sir James StewartEB1911of Killeith, Lord Ochiltree planted a colony on Cape Breton Island at Baleine, Nova Scotia; and Alexander’s son, William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling, established the first incarnation of "New Scotland" at Port Royal. This set of Scottish triumphs which left Cape Sable as the only major French holding in North America was not destined to last.  Charles I’s haste to make peace with France on the terms most beneficial to him meant that the new North American gains would be bargained away in the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1632).The French quickly defeated the Scottish at Baleine, and established the first permanent settlements on Île Royale: present day Englishtown (1629) and St. Peter's (1630). These settlements lasted almost continuously until Nicolas Denys left in 1659.  Île Royale then remained vacant for more than fifty years, until the communities along with Louisbourg were established in 1713.Île RoyaleFile:Naval Ensign of the Kingdom of France.svg|thumb|left|100px|French Naval Ensign (pure white) flown over the Colony of Île Royale.Known as "'''Île Royale'''" to the French, the island also saw active settlement by France.  After the French ceded their colonies on Newfoundland and the Acadian mainland to the British by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the French relocated the population of Plaisance, Newfoundland, to Île-Royale (New France)|Île Royale and the French garrison was established in the central eastern part at Sainte Anne.  As the harbour at Sainte Anne experienced icing problems, it was decided to construct a much larger fortification at Louisbourg to improve defences at the entrance to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and to defend France's fishing fleet on the Grand Banks.[''Canadian Military Heritage'']; vol.1, Chapter 6: Soldiers of the Atlantic Seaboard, p103. Government of Canada, 2004-04-26 The French also built the Louisbourg Lighthouse in 1734, the first lighthouse in Canada and one of the first in North America.  In addition to Cape Breton Island, the French colony of Île Royale also included Prince Edward Island|Île Saint-Jean, today called Prince Edward Island.File:British burninng warship Prudent and capturing Bienfaisant. Siege of Louisbourg 1758. Maritime Museum of the Atlantic, M55.7.1.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Siege of Louisbourg (1758)Louisbourg itself was one of the most important commercial and military centres in New France.  Louisbourg was captured by New EnglandersEB1911with British naval assistance in 1745"timeline"and by British forces in 1758. The French population of Île Royale was deported to France after each siege. While French settlers returned to their homes in Île Royale after the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was signed in 1748, the fortress was demolished after the second siege. Île Royale remained formally part of New France until it was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris in 1763. It was then merged with the adjacent, British colony of Nova Scotia (present day peninsular Nova Scotia and New Brunswick). Acadians who had been expelled from Nova Scotia and Île Royale were permitted to settle in Cape Breton beginning in 1764,"timeline"and established communities in north-western Cape Breton, near Cheticamp, and southern Cape Breton, on and near Isle Madame.Some of the first British-sanctioned settlers on the island following the Seven Years' War were Irish, although upon settlement they merged with local French communities to form a culture rich in music and tradition.  From 1763 to 1784, the island was administratively part of the colony of Nova ScotiaEB1911and was governed from Halifax.The first permanently settled Scottish community on Cape Breton Island was Judique, settled in 1775 by Michael Mor MacDonald. He spent his first winter using his upside-down boat for shelter, which is reflected in the architecture of the village's Community Centre. He composed a song about the area called "O's alainn an t-aite", or "Fair is the Place."Colony of Cape Breton100px|Flag of the Colony of Cape Breton 1784–1801.File:Civil Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|100px|Flag of the Colony of Cape Breton 1801–1820.In 1784, Britain split the colony of Nova Scotia into three separate colonies:  New Brunswick, Cape Breton Island, and present-day peninsular Nova Scotia, in addition to the adjacent colonies of St. John's Island (renamed Prince Edward Island in 1798) and Newfoundland.  The colony of Cape Breton Island had its capital at Sydney on its namesake harbour fronting on Spanish Bay and the Cabot Strait. Its first Lieutenant-Governor was Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres (1784–1787) and his successor was William Macarmick (1787).A number of United Empire Loyalists emigrated to the Canadian colonies, including Cape Breton.  David Mathews, the former Mayor of New York City during the American Revolution, emigrated with his family to Cape Breton in 1783.  He succeeded Macarmick as head of the colony and served from 1795 to 1798.From 1799 to 1807, the military commandant was John Despard, brother of Edward.Despard, John; ''The Companion to British History'', RoutledgeAn order forbidding the granting of land in Cape Breton, issued in 1763, was removed in 1784. The mineral rights to the island were given over to the Duke of York by an order-in-council. The British government had intended that the Crown take over the operation of the mines when Cape Breton was made a colony, but this was never done, probably because of the rehabilitation cost of the mines. The mines were in a neglected state, caused by careless operations dating back at least to the time of the final fall of Louisbourg.Large-scale shipbuilding began in the 1790s, beginning with schooners for local trade moving in the 1820s to larger brigs and brigantines, mostly built for British shipowners. Shipbuilding peaked in the 1850s, marked in 1851 by the full rigged ship ''Lord Clarendon'', the largest wooden ship ever built in Cape Breton.Merger with Nova ScotiaIn 1820, the colony of Cape Breton Island was merged for the second time with Nova Scotia.  This development is one of the factors which led to large-scale industrial development in the Sydney Coal Field of eastern Cape Breton County. By the late 19th century, as a result of the faster shipping, expanding fishery and industrialization of the island, exchanges of people between the island of Newfoundland and Cape Breton increased, beginning a cultural exchange that continues to this day.During the first half of the 19th century, Cape Breton Island experienced an influx of Highland Scots numbering approximately 50,000 as a result of the Highland Clearances.  Today, the descendants of the Highland Scots dominate Cape Breton Island's culture, particularly in rural communities.  To this day, Gaelic is still the first language of a number of elderly Cape Bretoners. The growing influence of English-dominated media from outside the Scottish communities saw the use of this language erode quickly during the 20th century. Many of the Scots who immigrated there were either Roman Catholics or Presbyterians, which can be seen in a number of island landmarks and place names.The 1920s were some of the most violent times in Cape Breton. They were marked by several severe labour disputes.  The famous murder of William Davis by strike breakers, and the seizing of the New Waterford power plant by striking miners led to a major union sentiment that persists to this day in some circles. William Davis Miners' Memorial Day is celebrated in coal mining towns to commemorate the deaths of miners at the hands of the coal companies.20th centuryThe turn of the 20th century saw Cape Breton Island at the forefront of scientific achievement with the now-famous activities launched by inventors Alexander Graham Bell and Guglielmo Marconi.Following his successful invention of the telephone and being relatively wealthy, Bell acquired land near Baddeck in 1885, largely due to surroundings reminiscent of his early years in Scotland. He established a summer estate complete with research laboratories, working with deaf people—including Helen Keller—and continued to invent. Baddeck would be the site of his experiments with hydrofoil technologies as well as the Aerial Experiment Association, financed by his wife, which saw the first powered flight in the British Empire when the AEA ''Silver Dart'' took off from the ice-covered waters of Bras d'Or Lake. Bell also built the forerunner to the iron lung and experimented with breeding sheep.Marconi's contributions to Cape Breton Island were also quite significant, as he used the island's geography to his advantage in transmitting the first North American trans-Atlantic radio message from a station constructed at Table Head in Glace Bay to a receiving station at Poldhu in Cornwall, England. Marconi's pioneering work in Cape Breton marked the beginning of modern radio technology. Marconi's station at Marconi Towers, on the outskirts of Glace Bay, became the chief communication centre for the Royal Canadian Navy in World War I through to the early years of World War II.Promotions for tourism beginning in the 1950s recognized the importance of the Scottish culture to the province, and the provincial government started encouraging the use of Gaelic once again. The establishment of funding for the Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts and formal Gaelic language courses in public schools are intended to address the near-loss of this culture to English assimilation.In the 1960s, the Fortress of Louisbourg was partially reconstructed by Parks Canada. Since 2009, this National Historic Site of Canada has attracted an average of 90000 visitors per year.EnvironmentGeographyThe Sydney waterfront, focal point of the largest population centre on Cape Breton Island.The island measures 0 in area, making it the 77th largest island in the world and Canada's 18th largest island. Cape Breton Island is composed mainly of rocky shores, rolling farmland, glacial valleys, barren headlands, mountains, woods and plateaus.  Geological evidence suggests that at least part of the island was originally joined with present-day Scotland and Norway, now separated by millions of years of continental drift.The northern portion of Cape Breton Island is dominated by the Cape Breton Highlands, commonly shortened to simply the "Highlands", which are an extension of the Appalachian mountain chain.  The Highlands comprise the northern portions of Inverness and Victoria counties.  In 1936 the federal government established the Cape Breton Highlands National Park covering  across the northern third of the Highlands. The Cabot Trail scenic highway also encircles the coastal perimeter of the plateau.Cape Breton Island's hydrological features include the Bras d'Or Lake system, a salt-water fjord at the heart of the island, and freshwater features including Lake Ainslie, the Margaree River system, and the Mira River. Innumerable smaller rivers and streams drain into the Bras d'Or Lake estuary and onto the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Atlantic coasts.Cape Breton Island is joined to the mainland by the Canso Causeway, which was completed in 1955, enabling direct road and rail traffic to and from the island, but requiring marine traffic to pass through the Canso Canal at the eastern end of the causeway.Cape Breton Island is divided into four counties: Cape Breton, Inverness, Richmond, and Victoria.WildlifeCape Breton Highlands National ParkDemographicsThe former Congregation Sons of Israel synagogue, in Glace Bay. In 1902, the synagogue was the first purpose built synagogue in Nova Scotia. It permanently closed in July 2010. To the left is the also closed Talmud Torah community centre. This was the location of the Hebrew school and functions like Bar Mitzvah and wedding dinners.The island's residents can be grouped into five main cultures; Scottish, Mi'kmaq, Acadian,  Irish, and English, with respective languages  Gaelic (Scottish and Irish), Mi'kmaq, French, and English.  English is now the primary spoken language, though Mi'kmaq, Gaelic and French are still heard.Later migrations of Black Loyalists, Italians, and Eastern Europeans mostly settled in the eastern part of the island around the Industrial Cape Breton region. The population of Cape Breton Island has been in decline for almost two decades with an increasing population exodus in recent years due to economic conditions.According to the Census of Canada, the population of Cape Breton Island in 2011 was 135,974,"Table from Statistics Canada"a 4.4% decline from 142,298 in 2006, and a 14.1% decline from 158,260 in 1996.'''Religious groups'''Statistics Canada in 2001 reported a "religion" total of 145,525 for Cape Breton, including 5,245 with "no religious affiliation."'''' (Nova Scotia Statistics Agency)'''' (Nova Scotia Statistics Agency) Major categories included:* Roman Catholic : 96,260 (includes Eastern Catholic, Polish National Catholic Church, Old Catholic)* Protestant: 42,390* Christian, not included elsewhere: 580* Orthodox: 395* Jewish: 250* Muslim: 145A Synagogue in Sydney serves a small historic Jewish community which was once one of the largest ones in eastern Canada with four shuls: one in Glace Bay, one in New Waterford, one in Whitney Pier, and the one in Sydney.More recent Muslim immigrants hold Friday prayers at Cape Breton University and the former Holy Redeemer Hall in Whitney Pier.  Buddhists are a small minority (105 in 2001, according to Statistics Canada), although Gampo Abbey in Pleasant Bay has been operational since 1984.EconomyCape Breton Island's most recognizable and commonly used flag.File:Cape Breton Island flag 1997.png|thumb|100px|Cape Breton Island's "Eagle" flag (1994). The official flag of the island.. Cape Breton Post (2009-11-23). Retrieved on 2014-04-12.Cape Breton Island's second cultural flag, the "Tartan" flag (early 1990s)Cape Breton Island's first cultural flag, the blue-and-yellow flag dates to the 1940sMuch of the recent economic history of Cape Breton Island can be tied to the coal industry.The island has two major coal deposits:* the Sydney Coal Field in the southeastern part of the island along the Atlantic Ocean drove the Industrial Cape Breton economy throughout the 19th and 20th centuries—until after World War II, its industries were the largest private employers in Canada.* the Inverness Coal Field in the western part of the island along the Gulf of St. Lawrence is significantly smaller but hosted several mines.Sydney has traditionally been the main port, with various facilities in a large, sheltered, natural harbour. It is the island's largest commercial centre and home to the ''Cape Breton Post'' daily newspaper, as well as one television station, CJCB-TV (CTV), and several radio stations. The Marine Atlantic terminal at North Sydney is the terminal for large ferries traveling to Channel-Port aux Basques and seasonally to Argentia, both on the island of Newfoundland.Point Edward on the west side of Sydney Harbour is the location of Sydport, a former navy base (Protector) now converted to commercial use. The Canadian Coast Guard College is located nearby at Westmount.  Petroleum, bulk coal, and cruise ship facilities are also located in Sydney Harbour.Glace Bay is the second largest urban community in population and was the island's main coal mining centre until its last mine ceased operation in the 1980s. Glace Bay served as the hub of the Sydney ; Louisburg Railway and also as a major fishing port. At one time, Glace Bay was known as the largest town in Nova Scotia, based on population.Port Hawkesbury has risen to prominence since the completion of the Canso Causeway and Canso Canal created an artificial deep-water port, allowing extensive petrochemical, pulp and paper, and gypsum handling facilities to be established.  The Strait of Canso is completely navigable to Seawaymax vessels, and Port Hawkesbury is open to the deepest-draught vessels on the world's oceans.  Large marine vessels may also enter Bras d'Or Lake through the Great Bras d'Or channel, whereas small craft have the additional use of the Little Bras d'Or channel or St. Peters Canal. The St. Peters Canal is no longer used by commercial shipping on Cape Breton Island, but is an important waterway for recreational vessels.The industrial Cape Breton area faced several challenges with the closure of the Cape Breton Development Corporation's (DEVCO) coal mines and the Sydney Steel Corporation's (SYSCO) steel mill.  In recent years, the Island's residents have been attempting to diversify the area economy by investing in tourism developments, call centres, and small businesses, as well as manufacturing ventures in such fields as auto parts, pharmaceuticals, and window glazings.While the Cape Breton Regional Municipality is in transition from an industrial to a service-based economy, the rest of Cape Breton Island outside the industrial area surrounding Sydney-Glace Bay has been more stable, with a mixture of fishing, forestry, small-scale agriculture, and tourism.Tourism in particular has grown throughout the post-Second World War era, especially the growth in vehicle-based touring, which was furthered by the creation of the Cabot Trail scenic drive.  The scenery of the island is rivalled in northeastern North America by only Newfoundland; and Cape Breton Island tourism marketing places a heavy emphasis on its Scottish Gaelic heritage through events such as the Celtic Colours Festival, held each October, as well as promotions through the Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts.Whale-watching is a popular attraction for tourists. Whale-watching cruises are operated by numerous vendors from Baddeck to Cheticamp. The most popular species of whale found in Cape Breton's waters is the Pilot whale.The primary east-west road on the island is Highway 105, the Trans-Canada Highway, although Trunk 4 is also heavily used.  Highway 125 is an important arterial route around Sydney Harbour in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality. The Cabot Trail, circling the Cape Breton Highlands, and Trunk 19, along the western coast of the island, are important secondary roads. Railway connections between the port of Sydney to Canadian National Railway in Truro are maintained by the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway.The Cabot Trail is a scenic road circuit around and over the Cape Breton Highlands with spectacular coastal vistas; over 400,000 visitors drive the Cabot Trail each summer and fall.  Coupled with the Fortress of Louisbourg, it has driven the growth of the tourism industry on the island in recent decades. The ''Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast'' travel guide has rated Cape Breton Island as one of the best island destinations in the world.Traditional musicCape Breton fiddlingCape Breton is well known for its traditional fiddle music, which was brought to North America by Scottish immigrants during the Highland Clearances.  The traditional style has been well preserved in Cape Breton, and céilidhs have become a popular attraction for summer tourists.  Inverness County in particular has a heavy concentration of musical activity, with regular performances in communities such as Mabou and Judique. Judique is recognized as 'Baile nam Fonn', (literally: Village of Tunes) or the 'Home of Celtic Music', featuring the Celtic Music Interpretive Centre. Performers who have received significant recognition outside of Cape Breton include Bruce Guthro, Buddy MacMaster, Natalie MacMaster, Ashley MacIsaac, The Rankin Family, Aselin Debison, Lee Cremo, and the Barra MacNeils.The Men of the Deeps are a male choral group of current and former miners from the industrial Cape Breton area.Film and television*''Squanto: A Warrior's Tale'' starring Adam Beach;*''Johnny Belinda'' (1948 film) by Elmer Blaney Harris;*''Margaret's Museum'' starring Helena Bonham Carter;*''The Bay Boy'' starring Kiefer Sutherland;*''New Waterford Girl'';*''The Hanging Garden'';*''Marion Bridge'';*''My Bloody Valentine'';*''Pit Pony'', TV movie and series adapted from the novel by Joyce Barkhouse;*''The Book of Negroes'', TV series starring Cuba Gooding Jr. adapted from the ''The Book of Negroes'' (novel) by Lawrence Hill.Notable peopleList of people from Cape BretonCape Breton artists who have been recognized with major national or international awards include actor Harold Russell of North Sydney, who won an Academy Award in 1946 for his portrayal of Homer Parrish in ''The Best Years of Our Lives'', and Lynn Coady and Linden MacIntyre of Inverness County, who are both past winners of the Giller Prize for Canadian literature. The Rankin Family and Rita MacNeil have both recorded multiple albums certified as Double Platinum by Music Canada.People from Cape Breton have also achieved a number of firsts in Canadian politics and governance. These include Mayann Francis of  Whitney Pier, the first Black Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, and Elizabeth May of Margaree Harbour, the first member of the Green Party of Canada elected to the Canadian House of Commons.Photo galleryFile:Cabotslanding.jpg|Cabot's Landing, Victoria County, commemorating the "first land seen" by explorer John Cabot in 1497File:Cape breton island 1.jpgFile:Cape breton island 2.jpg|The coastline of Bras d'Or Lake at Marble Mountain, Inverness Co..File:Cape breton island 3.jpg|A bulk carrier in the Strait of Canso docked at the Martin Marietta Materials quarry located at Cape Porcupine.File:NS CapeBretonHighlands2 tango7174.jpg|Cape Breton Highlands National Park.File:NS SmeltBrook tango7174.jpg|Smelt Brook on the northern shore.File:CapeBretonEntrance.jpg|Entering Cape Breton Island from Canso Causeway.File:Capebretonmainlandbridge.jpg|Seal Island Bridge in Victoria County, the 3rd longest in Nova Scotia.File:Sydney Harbour aerial view.jpg|Sydney Harbour with Point Edward, Westmount, and downtown Sydney visible.See also* Canadian Gaelic* Cape Breton accent* Cape Breton Labour Party* Cape Breton Regional Municipality* Provinces and territories of Canada* Province of Cape Breton Island* Sydney Tar PondsReferencesNotesCitationsBibliography30emBooks ; journals***************News media*********Other online sources**************External links;;Cape Breton Island* Cape Breton Island
