Bain-marie and a double boiler are not the sameIn American usage, a bain-marie is NOT a double boiler (I believe in the UK they are used interchangeably).A double-boiler is used on the stove to gently melt (for example, chocolate) or cook. You can purchase special nesting pots, but it works perfectly fine with a heat-proof bowel sitting over simmering (not boiling) water. The water does not touch the bowl.A bain-marie is used in the oven when baking custards like creme caramel, flan, or creme brûlée.  The baking dish or ramekin is placed inside of a roasting pain and water is poured around it.  The goal is to insulate the custard from the extreme heat of the oven and to slow down the cooking process. Some people put towels underneath the ramekins, but this is not required. Obviously here the water *does* touch the bowl.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Cogorno (talk • Special:Contributions/Cogorno|contribs) 06:14, 13 May 2012 (UTC);;; ;;Different from a double boiler?Is this different from a double boiler? It looks like a bain-marie is used in an oven and a double boiler used on a stove top. Anyone familiar with these things?  --rmhermen 19:36, 14 January 2002 (UTC): That's pretty much the difference.  Also, a Bain-marie allows water to come up to the level of the stuff being cooked, while a double boiler might not come that far. -- JHK 21:50, 14 January 2002 (UTC):: Well, what's it used to cook?  That sort of info is what would distinguish this from a dictionary entry. --LMS 21:53, 14 January 2002 (UTC)::: Primarily, custardy things -- I use it for a chocolate bread pudding recipe -- but you should use one for any custard -- it helps keep the eggs from breaking.  I don't see that there is any way to distinguish it, though, unless someone writes in a "development of" kind of way JHK 15:43, 25 February 2002 (UTC): "by submerging the container into a larger one with boiling or near boiling water. " Hmmmm... in photography if you need to process a film at 20°C in a room at 10°C a good way is to is to put the film tank in a large can of water at 20° to buffer the temperature (of course your chemicals should be heaten to 20° too). I've always called it a bain-marie even if no boiling water is involved.... Ericd 22:04, 16 September 2005 (UTC)I'm pretty sure a bain marie does not go in the oven. Then the oven would be doing the cooking not the hot water.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/69.182.153.232|69.182.153.232 (talk) 14:14, 16 October 2011 (UTC);; ;;Narrow definitionI think, the participants of this topic has focused on a narrow definition. In fact, bains-marie is used for storing foods to be still warm before servicing; this definition is taken from the intended use paragraph of the European harmonized standard "EN 60335-2-50 Household and similar electrical appliances – Safety – Part 2.50: Particular requirements for commercial electric bains-marie" according to 73/23/EEC Low Voltage Directive. Electric bains-marie can be dry or wet type; also, the wet type is vapourized or boiling. A heat source keeps "the bowl" warm; so, the dry bains marie is similiar to an electric pan, the open bath type bains-marie is made up of a bathtube which is used as a hot water bath for food bowls, and finally, the vaporized bains-marie heats the food bowl with vapour. Electric bains-marie is not a cooking device according to the standard EN 60335-2-50; it is used for keeping the foods in hot condition for servicing.

I do see that much of it was written by someone whose first language isn't English (but who might be an excellent ''sous-chef''), so I've worked mostly on syntax, grammar, and sentence structure, and of course overal MOS stuff.  I've deleted things that didn't seem relevant, or were pieces of info that were extraneous -- stuff people likely to look up this article aren't going to really care that much about.  I poked around and did some research, and there do seem to be many, many versions of bains-marie in existence, ranging from things like chafing dishes to things like double-boilers.  I think we're safe if we just describe, as simply as possible, the basic versions of all pieces of equipment referred to as "''bains-marie''," with some examples of what they're used for, and keep away from implying that there's only one kind and that it's "exactly like a double-boiler" or "exactly like a chafing dish."Anyway, that's my two francs.  Sugarbat (talk) 06:18, 9 May 2008 (UTC)Double Boiler or Bain-marie?It really would be nice if there were some clarification about the basic terminology here.  Is a Bain-marie a generic term for any device that uses water as a buffer to regulate temperature while a double-boiler is a more specific type of item?  Or are they synonyms? Or is one the common term in the US but not the UK? Or are there design differences such as a bain-marie having the upper vessel sitting directly in the water bath, while a double-boiler has the upper pan heated by steam from below?I tried to do some investigating myself and checked at least WordNet and Dictionary.com.  But it would be nice for someone who knows more about culinary matters and regional terminology to find some good references in that realm and clarify.Wordnet wasn't a lot of help with synonyms and word relationships in this case, though it did define double-boiler "double boiler, double saucepan (two saucepans, one fitting inside the other)" while the definition of bain-marie was less specific.Dictionary.com's first definition of bain-marie seems to imply that it works by placement of the inner vessel in the hot water of the outer.  Its second definition is "British. a double boiler."  When looking up "double boiler" it indicates that the term originated in America in 1875-1880 and it indicates two interlocking pots.My interpretation is that if you're in the US and say "double boiler" you mean a specific device with interlocking saucepans that is usually used on the stove top.  If you use the term "bain-marie" you might mean any device (including those designed for baking or chafing) that uses water to buffer the temperature.  If you're in the UK and say "bain-marie" you may mean the same thing as what most in the US would call a double boiler.Anyone know for sure or can shed more light from some good culinary sources?Special:Contributions/70.132.14.183|70.132.14.183 (talk) 07:29, 10 August 2009 (UTC)No Distinction.Basically there is no distinction between a double broiler and any method for keeping food warm by placing it in a container over hot water.  The name Bain-marie applies to both a double broiler and a steam table.  Ref: '''The Professional Chef''' The American Culinary Institute, 8th e., 2006,John Whaley ; Sons, Inc. Hoboken New Jersey, p. 163. --FBelden (talk) 22:40, 21 April 2010 (UTC)Merge proposalWhy are we using a French word as an English Wikipedia entry, when there's a perfectly good English term?  This thing ''is'' a double boiler.  In fact, until coming here, I'd never heard of a "bain-marie", and I'm somewhat north of half a century in age.  The multiple questions here, as well as at Talk:Double boiler, indicate that the choice of the French term as an article entry is ill-advised and only causes confusion.  (Lest one accuse me of being biased against the French, I'd say the same thing about any other language here, when equivalent English terms are available.  This ''is'' the English Wikipedia, is it not?  There's already an interwiki link to the French Wikipedia's "bain-marie" entry.)'''The article contents should be merged into Double boiler''', with passing mention of the "bain-marie" French term.;mdash;QuicksilverT Special:Emailuser/Hydrargyrum|@ 16:09, 22 April 2010 (UTC): The English name is Bain-Marie.

Dbpjmuf (talk) 01:45, 17 February 2011 (UTC)Merge. They are the same thing. No one on either this page or the Double boiler page has given any indication as to what the differences are, other than "Well WE call it a ....."Differences might be (i don't know):#Whether the water touches the upper pot - although this is irrelevant as the temperature will be the same regardless. The water temperature and the steam temperature that close to the water level, and in a mostly enclosed space will be the same as the water temperature.#Whether a Bain-marie is just a water-bath chafing dish used to keep food warm, and a double boiler is used to actually cook a food.#Whether or not it is used on the stove-top or in the oven. The article (and picture) indicate that it is a stove-top device. However, the TECHNIQUE of surrounding cooking containers with water in a larger container in the oven (e.g. ramakins in a roasting pan) might be properly called a Bain-marie technique. I don't know.There appears to be no difference other than regional nomenclature, which can easily be discussed in a merged article. BeadleB (talk) 08:46, 22 December 2012 (UTC)Don't MergeThe term "double boiler" generally refers to cooking only.  Conversely, Bain Maries are used in science and industry.

Even if they're not identical, they're far too similar to warrant having unrelated separate pages, and neither one is so long as to make the combination onerous. AdeMiami is also incorrect that double boilers are never improvised--see the Google Image Search results for "double boiler" to see the assortment of things people refer to colloquially as double boilers.
