A milk bottle showing cream risen to the top'''Cream''' is a dairy product composed of the higher-butterfat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization. In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, will eventually rise to the top. In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called "separators". In many countries, cream is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. Cream can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets.  Cream has high levels of saturated fat.[Saturated Fat]Cream skimmed from milk may be called "sweet cream" to distinguish it from whey cream skimmed from whey, a by-product of cheese-making. Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty, tangy and "cheesy".[Article on sweet cream, whey cream, and the butters they produce] In many countries, cream is usually sold partially fermented: sour cream, crème fraîche, and so on.Cream has many culinary uses in both sweet and salty dishes.Cream produced by cattle (particularly Jersey cattle) grazing on natural pasture often contains some natural carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat; this gives the cream a slight yellow tone, hence the name of the yellowish-white color, cream. This is also the origin of butter's yellow color. Cream from goat's milk, or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets, is white.CuisineImage:Pumpkin Pie.JPG|thumb|250px|A slice of pumpkin pie topped with a whipped cream roseCream is used as an ingredient in many foods, including ice cream, many sauces, soups, stews, puddings, and some custard bases, and is also used for cakes. Whipped cream is served as a topping on ice cream sundaes, milkshakes, egg nog and sweet pies. Irish cream is an alcoholic liqueur which blends cream with whiskey, and often honey, wine, or coffee. Cream is also used in Indian curries such as masala dishes.Cream (usually light/single cream or half and half) is often added to coffee in the US and Canada.Both single and double cream can be used in cooking. Double cream or full-fat crème fraîche are often used when cream is added to a hot sauce, to prevent any problem with it separating or "splitting". Double cream can be thinned with milk to make an approximation of single cream.The French word ''crème'' denotes not only dairy cream, but also other thick liquids such as sweet and savory custards, which are normally made with milk, not cream.''Larousse Gastronomique, 1938, translated 1961, p. 337TypesFile:Stewed nectarines.JPG|thumb|right|Stewed nectarines and heavy creamDifferent grades of cream are distinguished by their fat content, whether they have been heat-treated, whipped, and so on.

The above figures are based on the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 131[FDA ; CDRH ; CFR Title 21 Database Search;;][2005 CFR Title 21, Volume 2;;]AustraliaThe Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code - Standard 2.5.2 - Defines cream as milk product comparatively rich in fat, in the form of an emulsion of fat-in-skim milk, which can be obtained by separation from milk. Cream must contain no less than 350 g/kg of milk fat.Manufacturers labels may distinguish between different fat contents, a general guideline is as follows:{| class="wikitable" border="1"|-! Name!

Gräddfil and Creme Fraiche are two common sour cream products.Processing and additivesCream may have thickening agents and stabilizers added. Thickeners include sodium alginate, carrageenan, gelatine, sodium bicarbonate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and alginic acid.Dairy Fats and Related Products, edited by Adnan Tamime. This book has a great deal of technical information on cream and other dairy fat products. Extracts available on Google books 296[Carrageenan]Other processing may be carried out. For example, cream has a tendency to produce oily globules (called "feathering") when added to coffee. The stability of the cream may be increased by increasing the non-fat solids content, which can be done by partial demineralisation and addition of sodium caseinate, although this is expensive.DairyFats297Other cream productsChart of 50 types of milk products and relationships, including cream (click on image to enlarge).by churning cream to separate the butterfat and buttermilk. This can be done by hand or by machine.'''Whipped cream''' is made by whisking or mixing air into cream with more than 30% fat, to turn the liquid cream into a soft solid. Nitrous oxide may also be used to make whipped cream.'''Sour cream''', common in many countries including the U.S., Canada and Australia, is cream (12 to 16% or more milk fat) that has been subjected to a bacterial culture that produces lactic acid (0.5%+), which sours and thickens it.'''Crème fraîche''' (28% milk fat) is slightly soured with bacterial culture, but not as sour or as thick as sour cream. Mexican '''crema''' (or '''cream espesa''') is similar to crème fraîche.'''Smetana''' is a heavy cream product (15-40% milk fat) Central and Eastern European sweet or sour cream.'''Rjome''' or '''rømme''' is Norwegian sour cream containing 35% milk fat, similar to Icelandic '''sýrður rjómi'''.'''Clotted cream''', common in the United Kingdom, is made through a process that starts by slowly heating whole milk to produce a very high-fat (55%) product. This is similar to Indian '''malai'''.Other items called "cream"Some non-edible substances are called creams due to their consistency: shoe cream is runny, unlike regular waxy shoe polish;  hand/body 'creme' or "skin cream" is meant for moisturizing the skin.Regulations in many jurisdictions restrict the use of the word ''cream'' for foods. Words such as ''creme'', ''kreme'', ''creame'', or ''whipped topping'' (e.g., Cool Whip) are often used for products which cannot legally be called cream. Oreo cookies are a type of sandwich cookie in which two biscuits have a soft, sweet filling between them which is called "crème filling". In some cases foods can be described as cream although they do not contain predominantly milk fats; for example in Britain "ice cream" does not have to be a dairy product (although it must be labelled "contains non-milk fat"), and salad cream is the customary name for a condiment that has been produced since the 1920sSee also*Artificial cream*Buttercream*Condensed milk*Cool Whip, a brand of imitation whipped cream.* Crème (disambiguation)|Crème, a culinary term for cream-like preparations**Crème fraîche**Crème liqueur*Ice cream*Kaymak, which is similar to clotted cream* List of dairy products*Malai*Non-dairy creamer*Sour cream*Smetana*Whipped-cream charger, describes how nitrous oxide whips creamReferencesExternal linksCream*
