;;'''Amoxicillin''', also spelled '''amoxycillin''' and '''amox''', is an antibiotic useful for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections.AHFS2015It is the first line treatment for middle ear infections.;; It may also be used for strep throat, pneumonia, skin infections, and urinary tract infections among others.;; It is taken by mouth.;;Common side effects include nausea and rash.AHFS2015It may also increase the risk of yeast infections and, when used in combination with clavulanic acid, diarrhea. It should not be used in those who are allergic to penicillin.;; While usable in those with kidney problems, the dose may need to be decreased.;; Its use in pregnancy and breastfeeding does not appear to be harmful.AHFS2015;;Amoxicillin first became available in 1972. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system. It is one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in children. Amoxicillin is available as a generic medication.AHFS2015It has a wholesale costs between 0.02 and 0.05 USD per pill. In the United States ten days of treatment costs about 16 USD.AHFS2015Medical usesAmoxicillin BPAmoxicillin is used in the treatment of a number of infections, including acute otitis media, streptococcal pharyngitis, pneumonia, skin infections, urinary tract infections, ''Salmonella'' infections, Lyme disease, and chlamydia infections.AHFS2015Respiratory infectionsAmoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate have been recommended by guidelines as the drug of choice for bacterial sinusitis, but most sinusitis is caused by viruses, for which amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate are ineffective, and the small benefit gained by Amoxicillin may be overridden by the adverse effects.Amoxicillin is recommended as the preferred first-line treatment for community-acquired pneumonia in adults by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, either alone (mild to moderate severity disease) or in combination with a macrolide. The World Health Organization recommends amoxicillin as first-line treatment for pneumonia that is not "severe".Skin infectionsAmoxicillin is occasionally used for the treatment of skin infections, such as acne vulgaris. It is often an effective treatment for cases of acne vulgaris that have responded poorly to other antibiotics, such as doxycycline and minocycline.Infections in infants in resource-limited settingsAmoxicillin is recommended by the World Health Organization for the treatment of infants with signs and symptoms of pneumonia in resource-limited situations when the parents are unable or unwilling to accept hospitalization of the child. Amoxicillin in combination with gentamicin is recommended for the treatment of infants with signs of other severe infections when hospitalization is not an option.Prevention of bacterial endocarditisIt is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.AHFS2015The United Kingdom recommends against its use for infectious endocarditis prophylaxis. These recommendations do not appear to have changed the rates of infection for infectious endocarditis.Combination treatmentAmoxicillin is susceptible to degradation by beta-lactamase|β-lactamase-producing bacteria, which are resistant to a narrow spectrum of β-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin. For this reason, it may be combined with clavulanic acid, a β-lactamase inhibitor. This drug combination is commonly called co-amoxiclav.Spectrum of activityIt is a moderate-spectrum, bacteriolytic, β-Lactam antibiotic in the aminopenicillin family used to treat susceptible Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is usually the drug of choice within the class because it is better-absorbed, following oral administration, than other β-lactam antibiotics.In general, ''Streptococcus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus, Haemophilus, Helicobacter,'' and ''Moraxella'' are susceptible to amoxicillin, whereas ''Citrobacter, Klebsiella'' and ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' are resistant to it. Some ''E. coli'' and most clinical strains of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' have developed resistance to amoxicillin to varying degrees.Adverse effectsSide effects are similar to those for other β-lactam antibiotics,  including nausea, vomiting, rashes, and antibiotic-associated colitis. Loose bowel movements (diarrhea) may also occur. Rarer side effects include mental changes, lightheadedness, insomnia, confusion, anxiety, sensitivity to lights and sounds, and unclear thinking. Immediate medical care is required upon the first signs of these side effects.The onset of an allergic reaction to amoxicillin can be very sudden and intense; emergency medical attention must be sought as quickly as possible. The initial phase of such a reaction often starts with a change in mental state, skin rash with intense itching (often beginning in fingertips and around groin area and rapidly spreading), and sensations of fever, nausea, and vomiting. Any other symptoms that seem even remotely suspicious must be taken very seriously.  However, more mild allergy symptoms, such as a rash, can occur at any time during treatment, even up to a week after treatment has ceased.  For some people allergic to amoxicillin, the side effects can be fatal due to anaphylaxis.Use of the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination for more than one week has caused mild hepatitis in some patients. Young children having ingested acute overdoses of amoxicillin manifested lethargy, vomiting, and renal dysfunction.Nonallergic rashBetween 3 and 10% of children taking amoxicillin (or ampicillin) show a late-developing (;72 hours after beginning medication and having never taken penicillin-like medication previously) rash, which is sometimes referred to as the "amoxicillin rash". The rash can also occur in adults.The rash is described as maculopapular or morbilliform (measles-like; therefore, in medical literature, it is called "amoxicillin-induced morbilliform rash".) It starts on the trunk and can spread from there. This rash is unlikely to be a true allergic reaction, and is not a contraindication for future amoxicillin usage, nor should the current regimen necessarily be stopped. However, this common amoxicillin rash and a dangerous allergic reaction cannot easily be distinguished by inexperienced persons, so a healthcare professional is often required to distinguish between the two.A nonallergic amoxicillin rash may also be an indicator of infectious mononucleosis. Some studies indicate about 80-90% of patients with acute Epstein Barr virus infection treated with amoxicillin or ampicillin develop such a rash.Image:Amoxicillin rash 3 hours after 17th dose.JPG|Nonallergic amoxicillin rash eight days after first dose: This photo was taken 24 hours after the rash began.Image:Amoxicillin rash 11 hours after 17th dose.JPG|Eight hours after the first photo, individual spots have grown and begun to merge.Image:Amoxicillin rash 26 hours after 17th dose.JPG|At 23 hours after the first photo, the color appears to be fading, and much of rash has spread to confluence.InteractionAmoxicillin may interact with these drugs:* Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, dabigatran)British National Formulary 57 March 2009* Allopurinol (gout treatment)* Certain antibiotics* Cancer treatment (methotrexate)* Uricosuric drugs* Typhoid vaccineMechanism of actionsBeta-lactam antibioticThis drug acts by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls. It inhibits cross-linkage between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains that make up a major component of the cell wall of Gram-positive and a minor component of Gram-negative bacteria. Gram negative bacteria are not generally susceptible to Beta-lactam antibiotics.It has two ionizable groups in the physiological range (the amino group in alpha-position to the amide carbonyl group and the carboxyl group).HistoryTimeline of antibioticsAmoxicillin was one of several semisynthetic derivatives of 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) developed at Beecham, England in the 1960s. It became available in 1972, and was the second aminopenicillin to reach the market (after ampicillin in 1961). Co-amoxiclav became available in 1981.RavinaSociety and cultureModes of deliveryPharmaceutical manufacturers make amoxicillin in trihydrate form, for oral use available as capsules, chewable and dispersible tablets, syrup and pediatric suspension for oral use, and as the sodium salt for intravenous administration.  Amoxicillin is most commonly taken orally. The liquid forms are helpful where the patient might find it difficult to take tablets or capsules.Intravenous form is not sold in USAResearch with mice indicated successful delivery using intraperitoneally injected amoxicillin-bearing microparticles.Names"Amoxicillin" is the INN, BAN, and USAN, while "amoxycillin" is the AAN.Amoxicillin is one of the semisynthetic penicillins discovered by Beecham scientists. The patent for amoxicillin has expired, thus amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav preparations are marketed under many trade names and/or have several synonyms across the world, such as:*Actimoxi[Catalog.md: Actimoxi] Linked 2013-12-09*Alphamox*Almox*Amimox*AMOXIZIF*Amocla*AMK*Amoksiklav*Amorion*Amoxibactin (animal use)*Amoxibos*Amoxiclav*Amoxidal*Amoxil*Amoxin[Amoxin] Linked 2014-07-23*Amoxibiotic[Catalog.md: Amoxibiotic] Linked 2013-12-09*Amoxicilina*Amoxidal*Amoxoral (animal use)*Apo-Amoxy*Arsogil Linked 2013-12-09*Augmentin*Bactox*Bioxidona[Catalog.md: Bioxidona] Linked 2013-12-09*Cilamox*Clamoxyl*Clavamox*Clonamox*Curam*Dedoxil*Dispermox*Duomox*Defender Linked 2013-12-09*E-Mox Linked 2013-12-09*Enhancin*Ezymox[DrugsUpdate India: Ezymox from Sac Pharma] Linked 2013-12-09*Gimalxina*Geramox*Hiconcil*Himox*Isimoxin[Catalog.md: Isimoxin] Linked 2013-12-09*Klavax*Klavocin*Klavox*Lamoxy*Largopen*MOX*Moxatag*Moxiclav Duo*Moxikem*Moxilen*Moxypen*Moxyvit*Nobactam*Novamoxin*Optamox*Ospamox*Pamoxicillin*Panklav*Pinamox*Penamox*Polymox*Senox  Linked 2013-12-09*Sinacilin*Skymox[PalMediNet: Skymox] Linked 2013-12-09*Spektramox*Starmox[Sarthak Biotech India: Starmox] Linked 2013-12-09*Trimox*Tolodina[Catalog.md: Tolodina] Linked 2013-12-09*Tormoxin*Tyclav Linked 2013-12-09*Unimox*Vidamox*Wedemox*Wymox*Yucla*remox*Zerrsox*Zimox*Zoxicillin[PakMediNet (Pakistan): Zoxicillin] Linked 2013-12-09Names without individual reference are referenced on the drugs.com website.[Drugs.com: Amoxicillin] Linked 2013-12-09References30emFurther reading** British National Formulary ''45'' March 2003External links
