(I am not satisfied with that, it is too much jargon, there should be anUntitledexample, it does not convey the power of the concept and is just adefinition) -- Olivier.----Not only that, but what the heck is it?!?!   Seriously, I think good [encyclopedia]articles should assume that the reader may not know the context of the article.A single introductory sentence describing the context can make all the differencein the world.  -- Alan Millar----User:LinkBot/suggestions/Automorphism|Link suggestionsAn automated Wikipedia link suggester has some possible wiki link suggestions for the Automorphism article, and they have been placed on User:LinkBot/suggestions/Automorphism|this page for your convenience.''Tip:'' Some people find it helpful if these suggestions are shown on this talk page, rather than on another page. To do this, just add  to this page. ;mdash; LinkBot 01:01, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC): I added the links that made sense. Edward 07:52, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)Centerless?It talks of "if G is centerless" in the examples, but isn't G a group, and so contains the identity, which is commutative by definition, and hence all centers contain the identity? so doesn't this put the talk of a centerless group as impossible? -- Moxmalin:By definition, a group is centerless if its center consists of only the identity. See center of a group. -- Fropuff 00:16, 9 February 2007 (UTC)Automorphisms of '''R'''Currently the article states that '''R''' has no non-trivial order-preserving field-automorphisms, which is true, but potentially misleading since in fact '''R''' has no non-trivial field-automorphisms at all (since the order can be recovered from the field operations, as the positive elements are precisely the nonzero squares). I'm changing it. Algebraist 17:15, 22 March 2008 (UTC)
