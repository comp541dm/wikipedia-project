The '''Military Forces of Colombia''' () are the armed forces of the Republic of Colombia. ;brMore specifically, the Colombian Constitution () includes two overlapping definitions of what could be defined as 'armed forces' in English:* Public Forces (): Includes the Military Forces proper '''and''' the National Police (Title VII, chapter VII, Art. 216)* Military Forces (Fuerzas Militares): Includes only the 3 major military services: Army, Navy and Air Force (Title VII, chapter VII, Art. 217)This is a subtle yet important distinction, both in terms of emphasizing the civil nature of the National Police, and some differences that may apply to it as a service, as well as in clearing confusion when dealing with documents and references about the Colombian armed forces, in particular due to the large size of the police and the military-style operation and training of some of its most noticeable units, as a result of the Colombian Conflict.ServicesThe Colombian armed forces consist of: ;brMilitary Forces:* Colombian Army ()* Colombian Navy (Armada Nacional de Colombia) - and attached services Marines and Coast Guard* Colombian Air Force ()And,* National Police of Colombia (Policía Nacional de Colombia)Strength numbers"logrosPISDP2013"{|class="wikitable collapsible" style="min-width:50%;";;|- style="background-color:#CCCCCC;  align:wrap"|'''Force'''||'''Service'''||'''Officer'''||'''Sub-Officer/NCO'''||'''Enlisted'''||'''Trainee'''||'''Civilian'''||'''Total'''|-|Military||Escudo Ejercito Nacional de Colombia.svg Colombian Army||9,485||33,917||171,434||3,660||5,856||224,352|-|Military||Escudo Armada Nacional de Colombia.svg Colombian Navy||2,457||8,736||20,773||1,146||1,974||35,086|-|Military||Escudo Fuerza Aerea Colombiana.svg Colombian Air Force||2,499||3,603||4,134||1,050||2,747||14,033|-|Public||Coat of arms of colombian national police.svg Colombian National Police||6,691||3,560 police1||146,687police2||9,399||4,398||170,735|- style="background-color:#CCCCCC; font-weight:bold; align=:left"|colspan=7|Total||444,206|};/center;Dependencies* Military Medical Corps ('Sanidad Militar') - Medical and Nurse Corps* Indumil (Industrias Militares - INDUMIL) - Military Industry Depot* Military Sports Federation ()* Military Printing (''Imprenta Militar'')* Military Museum (''Museo Militar'') - History of the Armed Forces of Colombia* War Superior College (Escuela Superior de Guerra (Colombia) ESDEGUE)FundingIn 1999, Colombia assigned 3.6% of its GDP to defense, according to the National Planning Department. By 2007 this figure had risen to 6.1% of GDP, one of the highest rates in the world. The armed forces number about 250,000 uniformed personnel: 145,000 military and 105,000 police. These figures do not include assistance personnel such as cooks, medics, mechanics, and so on. This makes the Colombian military one of the largest and most well-equipped in Latin America. Many Colombian military personnel have received military training assistance directly in Colombia and also in the United States. The United States has provided equipment and financing to the Colombian military and police through the military assistance program, foreign military sales, and the international narcotics control program, all currently united under the auspices of Plan Colombia.World factbook statistics*Military manpower - military service age and obligation: 18 years of age for compulsory and voluntary military service; conscript service obligation - 24 months (2004)*Military manpower - availability:**males age 18-49: 10,212,456**females age 18-49: 10,561,562 (2005 estimate)*Military manpower - fit for military service:**males age 18-49: 6,986,228**females age 18-49: 8,794,465 (2005 estimate)*Military manpower - reaching military age annually:**males age 18-49: 389,735**females age 18-49: 383,146 (2005 estimate)Rank Insignia:Military ranks of the Colombian Armed ForcesFile:Infantes de marina colombia.JPG|Colombian marinesFile:Arc fragata caldas.jpg|Colombian Navy Frigate ARC Caldas|Colombian Air Force Arpia IIIFile:Special Forces Colombia.jpg|Colombian Special Forces soldiersFile:ARC Almirante Padilla.jpg|A vessel of the Colombian NavySee also* Agrupación de Fuerzas Especiales Antiterroristas Urbanas|AFEUR* Colombia* Colombian Army* Colombian military decorations* Indumil* Joint Task Force OMEGA* Military ranks of the Colombian Armed ForcesReferences and notes*police1Includes 435 ''sub-officers'' Suboficiales and 3,125 ''agents'' Agentes*police2Includes 123,125 executive personnel Nivel Ejecutivo and 23,562 Auxiliary conscript AuxiliaresExternal linksOther Linksfr:Armée nationale colombienne
