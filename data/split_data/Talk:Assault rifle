AVS as flagship for Assault riflesis a clear case of misrepresenting the sources so I have removed it. What Hogg actually states is "The Federov selective-fire rifle can '''probably''' lay claim to being the ancestor of the present generation of assault rifles, although it falls into that category perhaps more by chance than by design." He will go on to state that the rifle suffered from excessive muzzle blast and recoil in addition to having an open receiver which left the weapon exposed to mud and dirt. "Whether it was this defect, or simply that the unusual locking system failed to live up to its promise, the fact remains that the AVS had a very short service life, being replaced in 1938 by the more simple Tokarev."If the designers of the StG 44 used the AVS as a blueprint to any part of their design then there might be a claim but in actuality they didn't. It was a failed weapon that had no influence on the StG 44. Claiming it was the forerunner is false.—User:Berean Hunter|Berean Hunter User talk :Berean Hunter|(talk) 12:33, 11 May 2015 (UTC):Failed weapons ? No. StG is a failed weapon, not AVS. AVS was ceased to be used because the catridge is Arisaka 6,5mm, by which the USSR did not import and did not spend effort to domestically produce it. AVS is the first assault rifle but the Western propaganda do not want to recognize it.:StG is a failure and it has nothing to do with AVS, and nothing to do with AK. StG is not even an assault rifle, it is a machine pistol. The original name is MP 44.:MP 44 is not an assault rifle. It has no handguard and the catridge is damn weak.

A propaganda make nearly half of the population believe in idiocy of the Bible.:Kalashnikov was given the StG 44 ? So ? That doesn't make the StG 44 an assault rifle and that doesn't make any connection between StG 44 and AK. StG 44 uses tilting bolt, while AK uses rotating bolt. AK's design rotating bolt is learned from M1 Garand, it has nothing to do with StG 44. USSR began to develop M43 intermediate catridge in 1943, tried it in AS-44 of Sudaev and verified the concept of intermediate cartridge established by Fedorov Avtomat.:Not to mention that StG 44 is '''machine pistol''', its original name is '''MP 44'''. An assault rifle does not have proper handguard ? Don't joke with me, have you ever try to aim using a rifle ?:You read books but do you understand the concept of assault rifle behind it ?

"As work moved forward to incorporate this new firing system, development halted when Hitler suspended all new rifle programs due to administrative infighting within the Third Reich. Hitler ordered that newer submachine guns were to be built, and he strongly disagreed with the use of the Kurz ammunition. To keep the MKb 42(H) development program alive, the Waffen Amt (Armament Office) re-designated the weapon as the Maschinenpistole 43 (MP 43) and, making a few improvements, billed the weapon as an upgrade to existing submachine guns."  And 7.92×33mm is an intermediate rifle cartridge, not a pistol cartridge.

Since you previously used Hogg as a source, you may be interested in what he [actually says] regarding the progenitor of modern combat weapons. Yeah, I have put a few hundred thousand rounds through numerous weapons; built weapons starting from just the receiver, etc. I personally prefer .308 weapons so I own several of these; HK91(s), L1A1, Rem 700 VS, Rem 700 LTR...but I do own weapons that use assault rifle calibers as seen in the photos. I got rid of SKS (junk) and don't care to own an AK-47 because in the US they are grossly over-priced. If I'm going to spend that kind of money, I prefer machined weapons rather than stamped metal. If I could get a Romainian AK-47 for $200 then it would be a decent deal. So no, I'm not just someone with an academic-only interest in firearms.

You use a lot of gun and you don't know that a handguard is neccessary for gunner to put a hand to it to make a proper aim ?:MP 44 is truly a MP. It has no handguard, and soldiers put the left hand to the magazine, that pose is to quickly change the direction of the gun in close combat, that is a distinctive characteristic of machine pistol. On the other hand, a rifle/assault rifle desire much more about accuracy, that's why people put the hand at the handguard, nearer to the muzzle, to have a better aiming.:Kurz 7.92mm is also weak. It is slightly stronger than PPSh 7.62x25mm, but still weak. The name is '''Pistolen'''patrone 43, a '''pistol''' cartridge. MP 44 is truly a machine pistol, it was named MP not because of evading the wrath of Hitler.:The reason why Fedorov Avtomat was produced in a short period and small number, because it used foreign catridge, Arisaka 6.5mm. Fedorov tried to developed a domestic catridge for the Avtomat, but thanks to the idiocy and slavery nature of Russian monarch, he could not manage to. After 1917, the Red Army was poor, and did not have enough money to develop a domestic intermediate cartridge and further develop the concept of Fedorov Avtomat. Therefore they reverted back to the cheap and already reliable Mosin Nagant. Fedorov Avtomat was still limitedly use until WW2 due to out of ammunition. The design of Fedorov Avtomat was modified to use the old Mosin 7.62mm, it became Degtyaryov LMG. Russian assault rifles was stagnated for roughly a decades until WW2 when people started to realize the importance of "assault" characteristic and/or accumulate enough money to invest into that.

Contrary to all established references in the article, Sholokhov claims that the StG 44 is NOT an assault rifle and had nothing to do with the development of the AK-47. He claims that the references provided in the article are nothing more than propaganda. He claims that the StG 44 has no hand-guard and that it is a short range weapon comparable to a sub-machinegun. The only evidence that he has provided to support these unique claims is a single Wiki image. See below...centerYet, this image clearly shows an StG with a hand-guard and and fitted with ZF 4 sniper scope, completely refuting his own argument. ( see second photo with the hand-guard clearly labeled... The fact that he seems completely unaware of this most basic piece of firearms knowledge, disqualifies him from editing this page. Competence is required on Wikipedia and Sholokhov is clearly incompetent on the subject matter. Also, the fact that he calls all establish references in the article nothing more than propaganda, lead me to believe that he is unwilling to assume good faith and as such is unfit to edit Wikipedia in general.  --RAF910 (talk) 16:55, 16 May 2015 (UTC):Hell. Does that "handguard" prevent your hand from being heatburned if you put your hand continuously long time ? The only thing it can does it reduce the effect of heat if you mistakenly put the hand into the place.:@Berean Hunter: I am not hurt if you say Kalashnikov copy from this to that. AK design was "copy" from many thing, it didn't appear from nowhere. The gas operation tube was borrowed from Czechoslovakia ZB. The bolt was borrow from M1 Garand. The concept was set from Fedorov Avtomat. The idea of M43 cartridge was developed and tested by the USSR before AK was born. In short, Russian assault rifle is a collective and long term program, developed by many people and competitors, and get the idea from many places. Kalashnikov's design was the final winner in that long-time development. But MP 44 has nothing to be suited as the ancestor or inspiration of AK. Again, what does MP 44's tilting bolt has anything to do with AK's rotating bolt ? User:Sholokhov|Михаил Александрович Шолохов (talk) 06:14, 17 May 2015 (UTC)I've read this discussion in full. It seems like User:Sholokhov is trying to push some kind of POV into the article. He claims that the StG44 is a "failed weapon", not an assault rifle but a machine pistol, and had no influence on the AK47. Every single available source refutes his claims, but he turned around and accused ever available source as being "Western propaganda". This incredible insistance at denying the hard facts shows an obvious WP:CIR violation. Any continued editing in this fasion is disruptive and should result in a short block or topic ban. '''User:Sturmgewehr88|ミーラー強斗武''' (User_talk:Sturmgewehr88|StG88ぬ会話) 07:08, 17 May 2015 (UTC):Probably last post before I get a temporal/permanent ban, who knows. Without a proper handguard to effectively isolate the heat, the soldier cannot put the hand near the muzzle to have a proper aim. Nobody forbid you to put your hand at that position when the barrel is still not very hot, but I guess you already know full well how hot the barrel of a gun can become and in which time. About the ['''Pistolen'''patrone], that is pistol cartridge. The warhead diameter is nearly big as AK, but the propellant chamber is damn short. Germany killed MKb rifle program in 193x, and in 194x modified a MP to match the role of assault rifle, that method is totally stupid and it was caused by the stupidity of Hitler and his allies.:AK uses rotating bolt learned from M1 Garand, while MP 44 uses tilting bolt. You have to remember that, MP 44's kind of tilting bolt causes unfavorable vibration which is disliked by Russia and Germany. Actually Russia had the AS-44 using tilting bolt, but the historical role of AS-44 is simply testifying the concept of assault rifle and M43 cartridge, and AS-44 was not adopted. The Belgium FN FAL also used tilting bolt, but it was designed so that the vibrations more or less neutralize each other, which reduces the net effect.:But to be fair, we can consider that 193x-194x German guns for examp;le SK39 with the GECO cartridge 7.92x40mm, as the first attempt of Germany to create assault rifle. '''[SK39]''' is one of the latest version of the MKb35 program - the first assault rifle program of Germany, and the GECO 7.92x40mm is quite similar to the Russian M43 7.62mm.:Let me off topic a bit. You may know full well the goals of German MKb program, the product of MKb program should be 1) lighter and shorter than Mauser K98, 2) effective range similar to K98, 3) full auto fire-rate not faster than 360-450rpm, 4) resistance against dust and sand, 5) simple design. The biggest mistake of MKB requirements is that, it demanded the effective range similar to Mauser K98, that requirement significantly hamper the "assault" capability due to high recoil, and K98 effective range is not necessary because for average human soldier 300 metre is enough.:Back to SK39, it was killed by Hitler and his political allies. You may already know full well about Hitler dislike the idea of assault rifle. Because his close allies who held power in Nazi war industry were mainly MP producers. For the sake of MP allies, Hitler killed SK39 and MKb programs, and went on with MP designs. Only a small number of MKb35 guns were produced, and the strongest supporter of German assault rifle, Heinrich Vollmer, fell out of favour. Haenel and Walther continued to maintain the research of MKb prototypes, but H and W were wealthy businessmen rather than true scientists. To please the ego of Hitler faction, H and W corrupted the MKb program, use simpler design, smaller cartridge, i.e. made the MKb program become more and more like MP. Researches and experiments of the strong 8x40mm cartridge stopped after 1939. At the year of 1942, MKb prototypes used smaller 8x33mm cartridge, similar to the Pistolenpatrone of the MP 44.:German MKb received a further blow with the impressive performance of German MP at the beginning of WW2. At that time, opponents of Germany were small countries, weak countries, or countries with obsolete tactics and wrong military doctrine (France, etc). Therefore MP could easily win the battle and it caused the delusion of "superman MP". But Germany received a terrible shock when it invaded Russia in June 1941. Germany gradually witness Russian weapons like PPD, PPSh which were much stronger than MP38, and T-34 which was much better than Panzer 3 or Panzer 4. Shocked by the performance of PPSh and 7.62x25mm Tokarev, Hitler ramped up the already-corrupted MKb since 1942. But the MKb program was damn corrupted since 1939, 8x40mm cartridge was stopped to be developed for years, the MKB prototypes had no choice but went on with the weak 8x33mm cartridge.:That means, instead of making a matured assault rifle right from the beginning, Hitler killed the assault rifle SK-39 to went on with MP, and then modified the MP to match the role of assault rifle. A crazy way to go, that craziness was caused by the idiocy and ignorance of Hitler faction.:So you can see, the result of it, the MP 44, or you people like to name, StG 44, is a prematured baby, a freaking fetus. MP 44 is a laughing stock for German weapon makers. The 8x33mm is slightly stronger than 7.62x25 Tokarev, but still weak and in fact it essentially is a MP cartridge. In order to increase the power, Germany put as much as possible propellant into the small 33mm chamber, but that caused overpressure and increased the burden to the gun. The gun is as weak as a MP, but heavy (5.2 kg), and does not have a proper handguard which is necessarily to have a proper aim for a rifle.:MP 44 was adopted in the same year as G43 and MG42. The number produced is limited (430,000). And it is a failure, disregard of Hitler's attempt to propaganda as a magic to stop PPSh, and disregard of Western propaganda as a mean to dishonor the Avtomat Kalashnikov.:So in short it is like this.:*AK has nothing to do with MP/StG 44.:*StG 44 is essentially a MP who were, unsuccessfully, modified to fight as a StG.:*Germany actually had its own StG program, that is the MKb35, but the StG idea was killed by Hitler to favour the faction of MP.:*Later, due to harsh truth in Eastern Front, Germany ram up the MKb program which was already corrupted, and in fact Hitler force the MP design to have performance of StG, which is ultimately unsuccessful.:Done.

It was before he started designing the gun that he slept badly, worried about the superior weapons that Nazi soldiers were using with grisly effectiveness against the Red Army in World War II. He saw them at close range himself, while fighting on the front lines.

But how small can it go and still be a rifle, rather than a sub-machine gun?:::: The Avtomat has the problem that it's using a pretty useless cartridge, giving it the performance of a machine pistol. Nor can it use anything more powerful, owing to the overheating problem.

By this legal definition, the Arisaka 6,5mm chambered Federov, was not an AR because of it's Caliber/cartridge case size and power and the .30 Caliber M-2 Carbine was an AR by every meaning of the many other definitions. See ammo chart below to see that the .30 caliber Carbine cartridge was easily "Effective" depending on the definition of that word to well over 500 yards depending on energy to kill, or wound, or to well over 300 Meters by trajectory.Then there is the part of the Army Definition, as opposed to the one found in Comic books and other secondary sources about "effective automatic fire", not just effective fire, more on this later. If the fire must be effective automatic fire, then Neither the StG-44, or the AK-47 are effective assault rifles as neither one of them can hit much of anything at 300 yards, or meters as you like. But some folks think that just scarring the hell out of them with suppressive fire is ok, then they both count as ARs. But then so do all the full power battle rifles with select fire switches. But the .30 Caliber Carbine can by virtue of it's anemic cartridge be very controllable in a superior way to any of the above rifles such to get many more HITS, not just scarring the hell out them!The StG-44 was the first AR to be put in the field by any Army! That is not open to dispute, but it was and still is a piece of crapola! Look up it's many defects as documented by those who know it for a fact! On the other hand, the American M-1/2 Carbine was and still is one of the sweetest rifles around! Which any knowledgeable shooter would rather have than the StG-44 if his life depended on it!
