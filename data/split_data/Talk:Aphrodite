Unfamiliar with the second word, I looked it up in my Pocket Oxford Classical Greek Dictionary (2002). This was the entry, word for word.:'''δέαται''' he seems:'''•δέατο''' he seemedNow, knowing from my Oxford Grammar Of Classical Greek (2001) that ''-αται'' is the third person singular present middle indicative ending of ''-αω'' and ''-ημι'' verbs whose middle infinitives are ''-ασθαι'' (compare ''τιμάται'' and ''‘ίσταται'', third person singular present middle indicative forms of ''τιμάω'', "I honor" (middle infinitive ''τιμάσθαι''), and ''‘ίστημι'', "I stand up" (middle infinitive ''‘ίστασθαι''), respectively), and that ''-ατο'' is the third person singular imperfect middle indicative ending of that same group of verbs (compare ''τιμάτο'' and ''‘ίστατο''), but also knowing that, at least according to the Pocket Oxford Classical Greek Dictionary, this word only has third person middle indicative forms, and only in the present and imperfect, and also knowing that, were *''δεα-'' an ''-αω'' verb like ''τιμάω'', as opposed to an ''-ημι'' word like ''‘ίστημι'', it would have the accent on the Α ("*''δεάται''" and "*''δεάτο''"), not on the Ε ("''δέαται''" and "''δέατο''"), I propose the theoretical present middle infinitive "*''δέασθαι''", and the theoretical first person singular present middle indicative "*''δέαμαι''".Because "''deato''", the word listed in this article and quoted from the Janda source, is obviously the third person singular imperfect form of the word, I suggest that it be replaced, in the article, with a more appropriate form of the verb.The article currently reads as follows.:According to this interpretation, the name is from ''aphros'' "foam" and ''deato'' "to shine", meaning "she who shines from the foam [ocean]", a byname of the dawn goddess (Eos).I suggest that it be rewritten as follows.:According to this interpretation, the name is from ''aphrós'' "foam" and ''déatai'' "[she] seems" or "shines" (infinitive form *''déasthai''), meaning "she who shines from the foam [ocean]", a byname of the dawn goddess (Eos).I notice that the page is semi-protected.

More is said about Aphrodite throughout the Symposium,notably (since it seems there is some modern debate) that in her higher form her primary form of presencing (perousia) is the emotion oflove, and her lower form is sexual passion or lust.  Along with the Symposium, the best authority on Aphrodite is Hesiod, who can hardly bequestioned since he is the one invariably cited by the most prominent of ancient Greece's other thinkers and poets.Paul Leland Ness, B.A., J.D.

I'm no expert on this, but I notice that the wikipedia entry on Al-lāt says that Herodotus identified the Arbaian goddess with Aprhrodite, but that she was also identified with the Babylonian/Assyrian Ereshkigal and the Carthagenian Allatu, neither of whom were identified with Aphrodite.  That entry further says that the Arabian Al-lāt was identified with the Greek Athena and Tyche and the Roman Minerva - again not associated with Aprhrodite.I realize that it is technically correct that one Greek source identified Aprhodite with Al-lāt (and I do know more than a bit about Herodotus, who is far from infallible with details) and that ancient synchronization was not that tidy or unanimous, but it seems to me the sweeping way this is treated in the text of this entry is quite misleading and potentially confusing to users.

They tore him apart." I don't know if this is a faulty translation from another language, but it clearly should be about ''his'' horses (the horses of Glaucus), not ''her'' horses (the horses of Aphrodite?), and considering that this is a Greek myth it probably should say that she drove them mad (that is, insane), not that she made them angry. A horse doesn't tear its human apart out of mere anger. A good source reference would probably be an improvement too, but I no longer understand Wikipedia's rules on those, so I can't provide one.

Although the tale has Greek antecedents that are indicated mainly in art, it's unclear what role Aphrodite played in the Greek tradition. The tale is from a Latin novel of the 2nd century AD, and the male protagonist is named as Cupid, not Eros; the goddess is named as Venus. We don't know enough about what Apuleius received and what he invented to assert that this is such a major myth of Aphrodite that it should be recounted at great length in this article—especially since there's no summary at all of the wonderful Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, which is actually about Aphrodite, and highly informative regarding her nature. Even if one were persuaded that ''Cupid and Psyche'' should be included, it was given undue weight: two or three sentences could sum up Venus's role. The section had no footnotes at all, and really, what information about Aphrodite do we lose if we omit it? Cynwolfe (talk) 19:36, 24 March 2013 (UTC):Also deleted the Pygmalion section. See . Little is known about the Greek antecedents that would be revealing of Aphrodite; the tradition pertains mainly to the literary development of the character of Venus.  Because we don't have enough from Greek sources to know what this myth may have meant in regard to Aphrodite, there's no reason to include the tale at length. Both these tales could go in a short section that simply notes stories that developed about Venus in Latin literature that came from now-obscure Greek antecedents.

Parrot (talk) 04:42, 18 October 2014 (UTC)Semi-protected edit request on 21 June 2015;;The term "folk etymology" is used incorrectly twice in this article. Here is the first instance:"A number of folk etymologies have been proposed through the ages" (and the phrase hyperlinks to the Wikipedia article on folk etymology).But as the folk etymology article makes clear, the term "folk etymology" does NOT have anything to do with amateur or unscientific theories about the origins of words; rather it is "a technical [term] in philology and historical linguistics, referring to the change of form in the word itself, not to any actual explicit popular analysis."People who don't understand the accurate meaning of the term "folk etymology" often use it in this mistaken way, so it is especially important that Wikipedia not promote this erroneous use. After all, a reader seeking clarification who clicks on the "folk etymology" hyperlink will find the term defined correctly in a way that shows that its use in the Aphrodite article makes no sense.It's not entirely obvious what phrase would be best used instead of "folk etymologies"; perhaps "amateur etymologies" or "unscientific etymologies" or "popular etymologies" or "unscientific theories" or something along these lines.Later in the same paragraph "folk etymology" is again used in the same incorrect way: "...the medieval Etymologicum Magnum offers a highly contrived folk etymology, deriving Aphrodite from..."Unrelatedly, this same paragraph also ends with an ungrammatical clause: "...despite of course that the name cannot be of Macedonian origin." It is not correct English to say "despite that"; one has to say, "despite the fact that" so this clause needs to be "despite of course the fact that the name cannot be of Macedonian origin" (the placement of the "of course" is still awkward, but at least it's not ungrammatical-- better still would be "despite the fact that the name cannot of course be of Macedonian origin").;;Special:Contributions/72.227.133.128|72.227.133.128 (talk) 05:31, 21 June 2015 (UTC)Benjamin Friedman:Good catch, although one could argue that the term is perhaps being folk etymologised.
