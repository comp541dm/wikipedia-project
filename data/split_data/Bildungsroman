In literary criticism, a '''''Bildungsroman''''' (; "novel of formation, education, culture"), '''novel of formation''', '''novel of education''', or '''coming-of-age story''' (though it may also be known as a subset of the coming-of-age story) is a literary genre that focuses on the psychological and moral growth of the protagonist from youth to adulthood (coming of age),1999 in which character change is extremely important.OriginThe term was coined in 1819 by philologist Karl Morgenstern in his university lectures, and later famously reprised by Wilhelm Dilthey, who legitimated it in 1870 and popularized it in 1905.  The genre is further characterized by a number of formal, topical, and thematic features. The term coming-of-age novel is sometimes used interchangeably with ''Bildungsroman'', but its use is usually wider and less technical.The birth of the ''Bildungsroman'' is normally dated to the publication of ''Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship'' by Johann Wolfgang Goethe in 1795–96. Although the ''Bildungsroman'' arose in Germany, it has had extensive influence first in Europe and later throughout the world. Thomas Carlyle translated Goethe’s novel into English, and after its publication in 1824, many British authors wrote novels inspired by it. In the 20th century, it spread to Germany, Britain,Stein, M., "The Black British Bildungsroman and the Transformation of Britain: Connectedness across Difference" in Barbara Korte, Klaus Peter Müller, editors (1998) ''Unity in Diversity Revisited?: British Literature and Culture in the 1990s'', pp. 89–105, Gunter Narr Verlag, Tübingen ISBN 382-3-35192-3 France,Franco Moretti, Albert Sbragia (1987) ''The Way of the World : the Bildungsroman in European Culture'', Verso, London ISBN 978-0-86091-159-3Marianne Hirsch, , ''Genre'' Vol. 12 (Fall 1979) pp. 293–311, University of Oklahoma and several other countries around the globe.Slaughter, J.

The genre evolved from folklore tales of a dunce or youngest son going out in the world to seek his fortune. Usually in the beginning of the story there is an emotional loss which makes the protagonist leave on his journey. In a ''Bildungsroman'', the goal is maturity, and the protagonist achieves it gradually and with difficulty. The genre often features a main conflict between the main character and society. Typically, the values of society are gradually accepted by the protagonist and he/she is ultimately accepted into society — the protagonist's mistakes and disappointments are over. In some works, the protagonist is able to reach out and help others after having achieved maturity.There are many variations and subgenres of ''Bildungsroman'' that focus on the growth of an individual. An ''Entwicklungsroman'' ("development novel") is a story of general growth rather than self-cultivation. An ''Erziehungsroman'' ("education novel") focuses on training and formal schooling, while a ''Künstlerroman'' ("artist novel") is about the development of an artist and shows a growth of the self.Examples;;Precursors* ''Hayy ibn Yaqdhan'', by Ibn Tufail (12th century), a precursor of the genre* ''Parzival'', by Wolfram von Eschenbach, early 13th century*''Lazarillo de Tormes'' (1554)17th century*''The Adventures of Telemachus'', by François Fénelon (1699)18th century* ''The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling'', by Henry Fielding (1749)"McWilliams2009p14"* ''Candide'', by Voltaire (1759)* ''The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman'', by Laurence Sterne (1759)* ''Emile, or On Education'', by Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1763)*''Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship'' by Johann Wolfgang Goethe (1795–96)19th century*''The Red and The Black'', by Stendhal (1830)* ''The Captain's Daughter'', by Alexander Pushkin (1836)* ''Jane Eyre'', by Charlotte Brontë (1847)* ''Pendennis'', by William Makepeace Thackeray (1848–1850)* ''David Copperfield'', by Charles Dickens (1850)* ''Green Henry'', by Gottfried Keller (1855)* ''Great Expectations'', by Charles Dickens (1861)* ''Sentimental Education'', by Gustave Flaubert (1869)* ''The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'', by Mark Twain (1884)* ''Pharaoh'', by Bolesław Prus (1895)* ''What Maisie Knew'', by Henry James (1897)20th century;;* ''The Confusions of Young Törless'', by Robert Musil (1906)* ''Martin Eden'', by Jack London (1909)* ''The Book of Khalid'', by Ameen Rihani (1911)*''Le Grand Meaulnes'', by Alain-Fournier (1913)* ''Sons and Lovers'', by D.
