NPOV? Radical centre vs centre? Centre to centre-left?Can we remove "Radical center" (''sic'') from the Infobox, please? Firstly, it is merely a marketing term used by liberal political parties used to self-describe themselves, it is not a widely recognised academic political science term. Secondly, centre as a political position is preferable, more generic, and more easily verifiable. Thirdly, "Radical center" (''sic'') is cited with quotes from the LibDems' party leader and party officials - Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia, NOT a partisan blog, therefore we need to use neutral third-party sources to categorise a political party.--Autospark (talk) 13:51, 24 April 2015 (UTC)I agree, though I would say that radical centrism could be included as a political ideology as opposed to a spectrum position identified academically. JJARichardson (talk) 14:29, 24 April 2015 (UTC):There is no such ideology. Any descriptive information that could be communicated with "Radical center" (''sic'') would be far more accurately conveyed using commonly recognised terms such as Liberalism or Centrism, obviously with citations.--Autospark (talk) 14:35, 24 April 2015 (UTC)There's a citation from the latest Political Studies Association Symposium (2014) that clearly presented and discussed the radical centre ideology (which exists), identified the Lib Dems as such, and proceeded to analyse their record in government against this marker.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/92.24.107.228|92.24.107.228 (talk) 19:29, 27 April 2015 (UTC);;; ;;In addition to the question of centre vs radical centre, I want to point out that many reliable sources describe the party as being centre-left. Clearly, "centre [or "radical centre"] to centre-left" would be the correct description. I know that Lib Dem PR has increasingly been trying to portray the party as being firmly in the centre. But, Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia. Renren8123 (talk) 08:42, 4 May 2015 (UTC)I don't understand this whole debate. The only issue was with "radical centre" and that was removed and put down as a self-identifier *even though you can actually find some academic sources calling them that. Both Liberals and SDP were centrist (plenty of politics books calling them that), the Lib Dems since 1988 are always identified as centrist and social liberal from both journalists and academics. If anything they've become more centre-right than centre-left since the Orange Book. I think Centre covers it. If you find strong RECENT sources for centre left then let us know here. I don't think it's helpful to tag a whole article with NPOV for a simple extra "-left". If anything, it reads slightly negatively about the party. A lot of Guardian sources/quotes explicitly mocking for losing seats in all elections since coalition for example.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/92.24.105.83|92.24.105.83 (talk) 19:32, 4 May 2015 (UTC);;; ;;:I'd agree with that. The LibDems aren't a centre-left party; they have centre-left currents, and are much more influenced by social liberalism than the typical European liberal party, but also have centre-right currents as well and have moved rightwards since 2003. The history of the SDP/Lib Alliance was of a centre force placing themselves between the Labour and Conservative parties, and that is essentially what the modern LibDems still are. As for Radical centre, I consider it a contentious term, but as long as there is adequate academic referencing behind it (rather than just quoting a party figure), I'd accept it. I'd still prefer more 'generic' and internationally applicable terms such as liberalism, social liberalism and even centrism, however.--Autospark (talk) 20:44, 4 May 2015 (UTC)@Autospark I don't think the whole article is positive spin. But the very obvious emphasis on centrism does come across as being like PR. There's plenty of recent sources from academics, journalists, Lib Dems' enemies and their supporters for labelling the party as centre-left. Some examplesI should add that this Wiki article does itself (correctly, in my view) label social liberalism as being the ideology of the Liberal Democrats, not a mere strain or current. As for what the other guy said, the SDP was not centrist! The SDP was an explicitly  centre-left response to the perceived left-wing drift of the then Labour Party.Renren8123 (talk) 10:06, 5 May 2015 (UTC):You've got to tell me how Centre is positive spin when everyone is yearning for a progressive leftish party LOL. I had added (elements of centre-right and centre-left) with sources but that was deemed overkill. So we went back to simple Centre, nothing to do with head office although I'll let them know. The Orange Book has both economic/classical (CR) and social (CL) liberalism. I think just leaving it as Centre is fine to encompass everything, otherwise we run the risk of writing an essay in the infobox. Feel free to add those sources in the text though as it needs some work. Although be warned somebody else is just as likely to do the same for centre-right.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/92.24.104.116|92.24.104.116 (talk) 15:16, 5 May 2015 (UTC);;; ;;::Also I have to say the SDP not being centrist is your point of view sadly.

That the LD are liberals for example meets that.  Where they lie on the political spectrum depends on where one thinks the center of the spectrum lies.  Liberals present a special element of confusion, because they are generally seen as in the center but can make appeals to both left and right.  TFD (talk) 16:59, 5 May 2015 (UTC)To the IP address guy, if you pay attention to the election news, you will see that Nick Clegg is repeating over and over the view that the Lib Dems are in the centre, hence my comment about PR. 'The Orange Book' indeed. And what does the Wiki article on Social Liberalismsay: "Social liberal ideas and parties tend to be considered centrist or centre-left." You can find works placing UKIP on the far-right, Labour on the right, Labour in the centre, etc, etc, etc. The question is, what is the consensus? The SDP was the Social Democratic Party. The Wiki article on Social Democracy reads: "Social democracy is a political ideology that officially has as its goal the establishment of democratic socialism through reformist and gradualist methods." What is that if not on the left?TFD I don't think it's at all controversial to label the Lib Dems as being on the centre to centre-left. And I've provided mainstream sources that say this. Frankly, to read someone label Social Liberalism and even Social Democracy as being centrist is just bizarre! This article was rather stable until the beginning of this election season, when coincidentally it began to mirror the PR being put out by Nick Clegg, hence my suspicions. Renren8123 (talk) 21:00, 5 May 2015 (UTC)::: Not sure where reading other wiki articles to inform your point of view comes into this. Just because you're called the National Socialist Party doesn't mean you're even remotely left. Please read the actual sources I've provided about SDP rather than just reading the name. So does the Monster Raving Looney Party have Sulley and Mike Wazowski as candidates? Both SDP and Libs were centrist, so have the Lib Dems been for most of their history bar a short centre left stint before 2005 with Kennedy after Iraq. As I said, I'm more than happy for you to incorporate your sources into the text itself. But then somebody will also be entitled to add and discuss centre right sources. This is what happened in the infobox. One person adds left, another adds right and it reads Centre-left-Centre-Centre-right. Surely just Centre is fine, otherwise editors will spend all their time reverting one person who removes left and another who removes right. The infobox is not the whole article. I'm more than happy if you want to edit the article itself. I might even go and find sources about centre right to add even more depth.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/92.24.104.116|92.24.104.116 (talk) 21:16, 5 May 2015 (UTC);;; ;;::::Agreed that we shouldn't take political party names literally when categorising them; for example, the main centre-right force in Portugal is called the Social Democratic Party. The SDP was explicitly a centrist party. Also, Renren8123 offers citations for categorising the LibDems as centre-left, but those are almost all media opinion pieces, and we should not count media sources as reliable for categorising political parties. Academic/scholarly sources yes, media no. (FWIW, I agree that there are centre-left elements to the LibDems party.)--Autospark (talk) 12:58, 7 May 2015 (UTC):::::The SDP chose the name to distance themselves from the right-wing Salazar dictatorship its leaders had served.  There was also the far right "Liberal Democratic Party" in Russia.  There was nothing social democratic about David Owen's SDP UK.  In any case parties do not get to determine how they will be described in Wikipedia articles.  TFD (talk) 15:27, 7 May 2015 (UTC)This really needs to be re-visited after Tim Farron's election as Tim Farron leader - there are now numerous, strong sources for describing the Liberal Democrats as a centre / centre left movement - both commentators ; members self-describing themselves as such   03:10, 10 August 2015 (UTC):The election is very recent and we wait for third party sources to reflect actual positions rather than limited statements of intent.----User:Snowded|'''Snowded''';/font; User talk:Snowded#top|TALK;/font;;05:05, 10 August 2015 (UTC):A "progressive conservative" leads the Tory Party.
