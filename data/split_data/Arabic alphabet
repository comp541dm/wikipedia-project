File:Arabic alphabet world distribution.png|thumb|400px|Countries that utilise the Arabic alphabet: as the sole official scriptas a co-official script.The '''Arabic alphabet''' ( '''' or  '''') or '''Arabic abjad''' is the Arabic script as it is codified for writing the Arabic language. It is written from right to left, in a cursive style, and includes 28 letters. Because letters usuallyWhile there are ways to mark vowels, these are not always employed. Because of this, it is more exactly called an "impure abjad". See Impure abjad for a discussion of this nomenclature. stand for consonants, it is classified as an abjad.ConsonantsThe basic Arabic alphabet contains 28 letters. Adaptations of the Arabic script for other languages added and removed some letters, as for Kurdish, Ottoman, Sindhi, Urdu, Malay, Pashto, and Arabi Malayalam, all of which have additional letters as shown below. There are no distinct upper and lower case letter forms.Many letters look similar but are distinguished from one another by dots ('''') above or below their central part (''''). These dots are an integral part of a letter, since they distinguish between letters that represent different sounds. For example, the Arabic letters transliterated as ''b'' and ''t'' have the same basic shape, but ''b'' has one dot below, , and ''t'' has two dots above, .Both printed and written Arabic are cursive, with most of the letters within a word directly connected to the adjacent letters.Alphabetical orderThere are two main collating sequences for the Arabic alphabet, abjad and hija.The original '''' order (), used for lettering, derives from the order of the Phoenician alphabet, and is therefore similar to the order of other Phoenician-derived alphabets, such as the Hebrew alphabet. In this order, letters are also used as numbers, Abjad numerals, and possess the same alphanumeric code/cipher as Hebrew gematria and Greek isopsephy.The '''' () or '''' () order, used where lists of names and words are sorted, as in phonebooks, classroom lists, and dictionaries, groups letters by similarity of shape.AbjadīThe '''' order is not a simple historical continuation of the earlier north Semitic alphabetic order, since it has a position corresponding to the Aramaic letter ''samekh / semkat'' , yet no letter of the Arabic alphabet historically derives from that letter. Loss of '''' was compensated for by the split of ''shin''  into two independent Arabic letters,  (''shīn'') and  (''sīn'') which moved up to take the place of ''''. The six other letters that do not correspond to any north Semitic letter are placed at the end.{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"|+ Common '''' sequence|-|  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  |||-| gh ||  ||  || dh || kh || th || t || sh || r || q ||  || f || '''''' || s || n || m || l || k || y ||  ||  || z || w || h || d || j || b |||- style="color:gray"| 28 || 27 || 26 || 25 || 24 || 23 || 22 || 21 || 20 || 19 || 18 || 17 || 16 || 15 || 14 || 13 || 12 || 11 || 10 || 09 || 08 || 07 || 06 || 05 || 04 || 03 || 02 || 01|-| colspan=2 bgcolor=yellow || colspan=1 bgcolor=yellow  || colspan=4 bgcolor=lightgrey || colspan=1 bgcolor=pink || colspan=2 bgcolor=lightgrey || colspan=1 bgcolor=yellow || colspan=2 bgcolor=lightgrey || colspan=1 bgcolor=pink || colspan=14 bgcolor=lightgrey ||}This is commonly vocalized as follows::''''.Another vocalization is::''''{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"|+ Maghrebian '''' sequence (probably older) [Alyaseer.net ترتيب المداخل والبطاقات في القوائم والفهارس الموضوعية Ordering entries and cards in subject indexes] Discussion thread ''(Accessed 2009-October–06)''|-|  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  |||-| sh || gh ||  || dh || kh || th || t || s || r || q ||  || f || '''''' ||  || n || m || l || k || y ||  ||  || z || w || h || d || j || b |||- style="color:gray"|| 28 || 27 || 26 || 25 || 24 || 23 || 22 || 21 || 20 || 19 || 18 || 17 || 16 || 15 || 14 || 13 || 12 || 11 || 10 || 09 || 08 || 07 || 06 || 05 || 04 || 03 || 02 || 01|-| colspan=1 bgcolor=pink || colspan=2 bgcolor=yellow || colspan=4 bgcolor=lightgrey || colspan=1 bgcolor=pink || colspan=2 bgcolor=lightgrey || colspan=1 bgcolor=yellow || colspan=2 bgcolor=lightgrey || colspan=1 bgcolor=yellow || colspan=14 bgcolor=lightgrey ||}This can be vocalized as::''''Hijā’īModern dictionaries and other reference books do not use the '''' order to sort alphabetically; instead, the newer '''' order is used wherein letters are partially grouped together by similarity of shape.

Letters can exhibit up to four distinct forms corresponding to an initial, medial (middle), final, or isolated position (IMFI). While some letters show considerable variations, others remain almost identical across all four positions. Generally, letters in the same word are linked together on both sides by short horizontal lines, but six letters () can only be linked to their preceding letter. For example,  (Ararat) has only isolated forms because each letter cannot be connected to its following one. In addition, some letter combinations are written as ligatures (special shapes), notably ''''.Table of basic lettersArabic script{|class="wikitable sortable"|+ Arabic letters usage in Literary Arabic|-!colspan="2"|Common!colspan="2"|Maghrebian!rowspan="2"|Letter;brName!rowspan="2"|Letter;brName in Arabic script!rowspan="2"|Romanization of Arabic|Trans-;brliteration!rowspan="2"|Value (IPA)!colspan="3"|Contextual forms!rowspan="2"|Isolated;brform|-!Abjadī !!

See Arabic phonology#Consonants* d See the section on regional variations in letter form.*See the article ''Romanization of Arabic'' for details on various transliteration schemes; however, Arabic language speakers do not follow a standardized scheme when transcribing names. Also names are regularly transcribed as pronounced locally, not as pronounced in Literary Arabic (if they were of Arabic origin).*Regarding pronunciation, the phonemic values given are those of Modern Standard Arabic, which is taught in universities. In practice, pronunciation may vary considerably from region to region. For more details concerning the pronunciation of Arabic, consult the articles ''Arabic phonology'' and ''varieties of Arabic''.*The names of the Arabic letters can be thought of as abstractions of an older version where they were meaningful words in the Proto-Semitic language. Names of Arabic letters may have quite different names popularly.*Six letters () don't have a distinct medial form and have to be written with their final form without being connected to the next letter. Their initial form matches the isolated form.* The letter ''alif'' originated in the Phoenician alphabet as a consonant-sign indicating a glottal stop. Today it has lost its function as a consonant, and, together with  '''' and  '''', is a ''mater lectionis'', a consonant sign standing in for a long vowel (see below), or as support for certain diacritics (''maddah'' and ''hamza|hamzah'').* Arabic currently uses a diacritic sign,  , called ''hamzah'', to denote the glottal stop , written alone or with a carrier:** alone:** with a carrier:  (above or under a ''alif''),  (above a ''''),  (above a dotless ''''  or '''').In academic work, the ''hamza|hamzah'' () is transliterated with the modifier letter right half ring  (ʾ), while the modifier letter left half ring (ʿ) transliterates the letter ''Ayin|'' (), which represents a different sound, not found in English.* Letters lacking an initial or medial version are never linked to the letter that follows, even within a word. The ''hamzah'' has a single form, since it is never linked to a preceding or following letter.  However, it is sometimes combined with a '''', '''', or ''alif'', and in that case the carrier behaves like an ordinary '''', '''', or ''alif''.Modified lettersThe following are not individual letters, but rather different contextual variants of some of the Arabic letters.{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"|-!colspan="4"|Conditional forms!rowspan="2"|Name!rowspan="2"|Translit.!rowspan="2"|Phonemic Value (IPA)|-!Isolated!Final!Medial!Initial|-|style="line-height:180%;padding:10px;"||style="line-height:180%;padding:10px;"||style="line-height:180%;padding:10px;"||style="line-height:180%;padding:10px;"||Maddah|alif maddah|''''||-|style="line-height:180%;padding:10px;"||style="line-height:180%;padding:10px;"||style="line-height:180%;padding:10px;"||style="line-height:180%;padding:10px;"||Tāʾ marbūṭa||''h'' or  ''t'' / ''h'' / ''''|,|-|style="line-height:180%;padding:10px;"||style="line-height:180%;padding:10px;"||style="line-height:180%;padding:10px;"||style="line-height:180%;padding:10px;"||See the sub-paragraph about the ''ʾalif maqṣūrah'' at ''aleph'' in Arabic|'''' / ''''||}LigaturesFile:Arabic components (letters) in the word Allah.svg|thumb|right|240px| Components of a ligature for "Allah": 1. alif2.

Instead of writing the letter twice, Arabic places a ''W''-shaped sign called ''shaddah'', above it. Note that if a vowel occurs between the two consonants the letter will simply be written twice. The diacritic only appears where the consonant at the end of one syllable is identical to the initial consonant of the following syllable.

The vowel before it indicates grammatical case. In written Arabic nunation is indicated by doubling the vowel diacritic at the end of the word.VowelsUsers of Arabic usually write long vowels but omit short ones, so readers must utilize their knowledge of the language in order to supply the missing vowels. However, in the education system and particularly in classes on Arabic grammar these vowels are used since they are crucial to the grammar. An Arabic sentence can have a completely different meaning by a subtle change of the vowels. This is why in an important text such as the '''' the three basic vowel signs (see below) are mandated, like the ''Arabic diacritics|ḥarakāt'' and all the other diacritics or other types of marks, for example the cantillation signs.Short vowelsArabic diacriticsIn the Arabic handwriting of everyday use, in general publications, and on street signs, short vowels are typically not written. On the other hand, copies of the '''' cannot be endorsed by the religious institutes that review them unless the diacritics are included.  Children's books, elementary-school texts, and Arabic-language grammars in general will include diacritics to some degree.  These are known as "vocalized" texts.Short vowels may be written with diacritics placed above or below the consonant that precedes them in the syllable, called ''''. All Arabic vowels, long and short, follow a consonant; in Arabic, words like "Ali" or "alif", for example, start with a consonant: '''';;, ''alif''.{|class="wikitable"|-!Short vowels(fully vocalized text)!Name!Name in Arabic script!Trans.!Value|- style="text-align:center;"|style="line-height:180%;padding:10px;"|064E;||فتحة|''a''||- style="text-align:center;"|style="line-height:180%;padding:10px;"|064F;||ضمة|''u''||- style="text-align:center;"|style="line-height:180%;padding:10px;"|0650;|kasrah|كسرة|''i''||}Long vowelsIn the fully vocalized Arabic text found in texts such as Koran, a long '''' following a consonant other than a ''hamza|hamzah'' is written with a short ''a'' sign ('''') on the consonant plus an ''alif'' after it; long '''' is written as a sign for short ''i'' (''kasrah'') plus a ; and long '''' as a sign for short ''u'' ('''') plus a ''''. Briefly, '''' = '''', '''' = '''' and '''' = ''''. Long '''' following a ''hamzah'' may be represented by an ''alif maddah'' or by a free ''hamzah'' followed by an ''alif''.The table below shows vowels placed above or below a dotted circle replacing a primary consonant letter or a ''Shadda|shaddah'' sign. For clarity in the table, the primary letters on the left used to mark these long vowels are shown only in their isolated form. Please note that most consonants do connect to the left with ''alif'', '''' and '''' written then with their medial or final form. Additionally, the letter '''' in the last row may connect to the letter on its left, and then will use a medial or initial form.

In others, these ''y'' and ''w'' carry a ''sukūn''. Outside of the ''Qur’ān'', the latter convention is extremely rare, to the point that ''y'' with ''sukūn'' will be unambiguously read as the diphthong , and ''w'' with ''sukūn'' will be read .For example, the letters ''m-y-l'' can be read like English ''meel'' or ''mail'', or (theoretically) also  like ''mayyal'' or ''mayil''. But if a ''sukūn'' is added on the ''y'' then the ''m'' cannot have a ''sukūn'' (because two letters in a row cannot be ''sukūn''ated), cannot have a ''ḍammah'' (because there is never an ''uy'' sound in Arabic unless there is another vowel after the ''y''), and cannot have a ''kasrah'' (because ''kasrah'' before ''sukūn''ated ''y'' is never found outside the ''Qur’ān''), so it ''must'' have a ''fatḥah'' and the only possible pronunciation is  (meaning mile, or even e-mail). By the same token, m-y-t with a ''sukūn'' over the ''y'' can be ''mayt'' but not ''mayyit'' or ''meet'', and m-w-t with a ''sukūn'' on the ''w'' can only be ''mawt'', not ''moot'' (''iw'' is impossible when the ''w'' closes the syllable).Vowel marks are always written as if  the ''’I‘rab|i‘rāb'' vowels were in fact pronounced, even when they must be skipped in actual pronunciation. So, when writing the name ''Aḥmad'', it is optional to place a ''sukūn'' on the ''ḥ'', but a ''sukūn'' is forbidden on the ''d'', because it would carry a ''ḍammah'' if any other word followed, as in ''Aḥmadu zawjī'' "Ahmad is my husband".Another example: the sentence that in correct Arabic must be pronounced ''Aḥmadu zawjun sharrīr'' "Ahmad is a wicked husband", is usually mispronounced as ''Aḥmad zawj sharrīr''. Yet, for the purposes of Arabic grammar and orthography, is treated as if it were not mispronounced and as if yet another word followed it, i.e., if adding any vowel marks, they must be added as if the pronunciation were ''Aḥmadu zawjun sharrīrun'' with a ''tanwīn'' 'un' at the end. So, it is correct to add an ''un'' ''tanwīn'' sign on the final ''r'', but actually pronouncing it would be a hypercorrection. Also, it is never correct to write a ''sukūn'' on that ''r'', even though in actual pronunciation it is (and in correct Arabic MUST be) ''sukūn''ed.Of course, if the correct ''i‘rāb'' is a ''sukūn'', it may be optionally written.{|class="wikitable"|-!GeneralUnicode!Name!Translit.!Phonemic Value (IPA)|- style="text-align:center;"|style="line-height:180%;padding:10px;"|0652;|sukūn|(no vowel with this consonant letter ordiphthong with this long vowel letter)||- style="text-align:center;"|style="line-height:180%;padding:10px;"|0670;|alif above|''ā''||}The ''sukūn'' is also used for transliterating words into the Arabic script. The Persian word  (''mâsk'', from the English word "mask"), for example, might be written with a ''sukūn'' above the   to signify that there is no vowel sound between that letter and the .Additional letters==;;;;Regional variationsSome letters take a traditionally different form in specific regions:{|class="wikitable"! colspan="4" | Letter !! rowspan="2" | Explanation|-!

In most of present-day North Africa, the usual Western Arabic numerals are used. Like Western Arabic numerals, in Eastern Arabic numerals, the units are always right-most, and the highest value left-most.Letters as numeralsAbjad numeralsIn addition, the Arabic alphabet can be used to represent numbers (Abjad numerals). This usage is based on the '''' order of the alphabet.  ''alif'' is 1,  '''' is 2,  '''' is 3, and so on until  '''' = 10,  '''' = 20,  '''' = 30, …,  '''' = 200, …,  ''ghayn'' = 1000.  This is sometimes used to produce chronograms.HistoryHistory of the Arabic alphabetFile:Arabic script evolution.svg|thumb|250px|Evolution of early Arabic calligraphy (9th–11th century). The '''' is taken as an example, from Kufic '''' manuscripts. (1) Early 9th century script used no dots or diacritic marks; (2) and (3) in the 9th–10th century during the Abbasid dynasty, Abu al-Aswad's system used red dots with each arrangement or position indicating a different short vowel. Later, a second system of black dots was used to differentiate between letters like '''' and '''';File:Kufi.jpg - Wikimedia Commons"wikimedia1"(4) in the 11th century, Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi|al-Farāhīdī's system) dots were changed into shapes resembling the letters to transcribe the corresponding long vowels. This system is the one used today.The Arabic alphabet can be traced back to the Nabataean alphabet used to write the Nabataean dialect of Aramaic. The first known text in the Arabic alphabet is a late 4th-century inscription from '''' (50km east of '''') in Jordan, but the first dated one is a trilingual inscription at Zebed in Syria from 512.  However, the epigraphic record is extremely sparse, with only five certainly pre-Islamic Arabic inscriptions surviving, though some others may be pre-Islamic. Later, dots were added above and below the letters to differentiate them.  (The Aramaic language had fewer phonemes than the Arabic, and some originally distinct Aramaic letters had become indistinguishable in shape, so that in the early writings 15 distinct letter-shapes had to do duty for 28 sounds; cf. the similarly ambiguous Pahlavi alphabet.)  The first surviving document that definitely uses these dots is also the first surviving Arabic papyrus (PERF 558), dated April 643, although they did not become obligatory until much later. Important texts were and still are frequently memorized, especially in Qur'an memorization, a practice which probably arose partially from a desire to avoid the great ambiguity of the script.Later still, vowel marks and the ''hamzah'' were introduced, beginning some time in the latter half of the 7th century, preceding the first invention of Syriac and Hebrew vocalization.  Initially, this was done by a system of red dots, said to have been commissioned by an Umayyad governor of Iraq, '''': a dot above = ''a'', a dot below = ''i'', a dot on the line = ''u'', and doubled dots indicated nunation.  However, this was cumbersome and easily confusable with the letter-distinguishing dots, so about 100 years later, the modern system was adopted.  The system was finalized around 786 by ''''.Arabic printing pressesAlthough Napoleon Bonaparte generally receives credit for introducing the printing press to Egypt during his invasion of that country in 1798, and though he did indeed bring printing presses and Arabic script presses to print the French occupation's official newspaper ''Al-Tanbiyyah'' ("The Courier"), printing in the Arabic language started several centuries earlier.Following Gutenberg's invention of the printing press in 1450, Gregorio de Gregorii, a Venetian, published in 1514 an entire prayer-book in Arabic script entitled ''Kitab Salat al-Sawa'i'' - intended for the eastern Christian communities.Famed type-designer Robert Granjon, working for Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici, succeeded in designing (1580-1586) elegant Arabic typefaces, and the Medici press published many Christian prayer and scholarly Arabic texts in the late 16th century.Maronite monks at the Maar Quzhayy Monastery in Mount Lebanon published the first Arabic books to use movable type in the Middle East. The monks transliterated the Arabic language using Syriac script.A goldsmith (like Gutenberg) designed and implemented an Arabic-script movable-type printing-press in the Middle East. The Greek Orthodox monk Abd Allah Zakhir set up an Arabic language printing press using movable type at the monastery of Saint John at the town of Dhour El Shuwayr in Mount Lebanon, the first homemade press in Lebanon using Arabic script. He personally cut the type molds and did the founding of the elegant typeface. The first book came off his press in 1734; this press continued in use until 1899., by Paul LundeComputers and the Arabic alphabetThe Arabic alphabet can be encoded using several character sets, including ISO-8859-6, Windows-1256 and Unicode (see links in Infobox, above), in the latter thanks to the "Arabic segment", entries U+0600 to U+06FF. However, none of these sets indicate the form each character should take in context. It is left to the rendering engine to select the proper glyph to display for each character.For compatibility with previous standards, initial, medial, final and isolated forms can be encoded separately in Unicode; however, they can also be inferred from their joining context, using the same encoding. The following table shows this common encoding, in addition to the compatibility encodings for their normally contextual forms (Arabic texts should be encoded today using only the common encoding, but the rendering must then infer the joining types to determine the correct glyph forms, with or without ligation).UnicodeArabic characters in UnicodeAs of Unicode 7.0, the following ranges encode Arabic characters:*Arabic (0600-06FF)*Arabic Supplement (0750-077F)*Arabic Extended-A (08A0-08FF)*Arabic Presentation Forms-A (FB50-FDFF)*Arabic Presentation Forms-B (FE70-FEFF)*Arabic Mathematical Alphabetic Symbols 1EE00-1EEFF)*Rumi Numeral Symbols (10E60-10E7F)The basic Arabic range encodes the standard letters and diacritics, but does not encode contextual forms (U+0621-U+0652 being directly based on ISO 8859-6); and also includes the most common diacritics and Arabic-Indic digits. U+06D6 to U+06ED encode Qur'anic annotation signs such as "end of ''ayah''"  and "start of ''rub el hizb''"  . The Arabic Supplement range encodes letter variants mostly used for writing African (non-Arabic) languages.  The Arabic Extended-A range encodes additional Qur'anic annotations and letter variants used for various non-Arabic languages. The Arabic Presentation Forms-A range encodes contextual forms and ligatures of letter variants needed for Persian, Urdu, Sindhi and Central Asian languages. The Arabic Presentation Forms-B range encodes spacing forms of Arabic diacritics, and more contextual letter forms.  The Arabic Mathematical Alphabetical Symbols block encodes characters used in Arabic mathematical expressions.See also the notes of the section on modified letters.KeyboardsArabic Mac keyboard layoutArabic PC keyboard layout450px|Intellark imposed on a QWERTY keyboard layout.Keyboards designed for different nations have different layouts, so that proficiency in one style of keyboard such as Iraq's does not transfer to proficiency in another keyboard such as Saudi Arabia's.   Differences can include the location of non-alphabetic characters.All Arabic keyboards allow typing Roman characters, e.g., for the URL in a web browser. Thus, each Arabic keyboard has both Arabic and Roman characters marked on the keys. Usually the Roman characters of an Arabic keyboard conform to the QWERTY layout, but in North Africa, where French is the most common language typed using the Roman characters, the Arabic keyboards are AZERTY.To encode a particular written form of a character, there are extra code points provided in Unicode which can be used to express the exact written form desired.  The range ''Arabic presentation forms A'' (U+FB50 to U+FDFF) contain ligatures while the range ''Arabic presentation forms B'' (U+FE70 to U+FEFF) contains the positional variants.  These effects are better achieved in Unicode  by using the ''zero-width joiner'' and ''non-joiner'', as these presentation forms are deprecated in Unicode, and should generally only be used within the internals of text-rendering software, when using Unicode as an intermediate form for conversion between character encodings, or for backwards compatibility with implementations that rely on the hard-coding of glyph forms.Finally, the Unicode encoding of Arabic is in ''logical order'', that is, the characters are entered, and stored in computer memory, in the order that they are written and pronounced without worrying about the direction in which they will be displayed on paper or on the screen. Again, it is left to the rendering engine to present the characters in the correct direction, using Unicode's bi-directional text features. In this regard, if the Arabic words on this page are written left to right, it is an indication that the Unicode rendering engine used to display them is out of date.For more information about encoding Arabic, consult the Unicode manual available at [The Unicode website]See also [Multilingual Computing with Arabic and Arabic Transliteration: Arabicizing Windows Applications to Read and Write Arabic ; Solutions for the Transliteration Quagmire Faced by Arabic-Script Languages] and [A PowerPoint Tutorial (with screen shots and an English voice-over) on how to add Arabic to the Windows Operating System].There are competing on-line tools, e.g. [Yamli editor], which allow entry of Arabic letters without having Arabic support installed on a PC, and without knowledge of the layout of the Arabic keyboard.[Yamli in the News]Handwriting recognitionThe first software program of its kind in the world that identifies Arabic handwriting in real time has been developed by researchers at Ben-Gurion University (BGU).The prototype enables the user to write Arabic words by hand on an electronic screen, which then analyzes the text and translates it into printed Arabic letters in a thousandth of a second. The error rate is less than three percent, according to Dr. Jihad El-Sana, from BGU's department of computer sciences, who developed the system along with master's degree student Fadi Biadsy.See alsoArabic alphabet*Arabic calligraphy*Arabic diacritics (pointed vowels and consonants)*Arabic numerals*Arabic script about other languages written in Arabic letters.*Arabic Unicode*Arabic Chat Alphabet*ArabTeX – provides Arabic support for TeX and LaTeX*Rasm (unpointed consonants)*Romanization of Arabic*South Arabian alphabet*Perso-Arabic script*Additional Arabic Letters*Arabic braille*Algerian brailleReferences2External links****[Why the right side of your brain doesn't like Arabic];;*----''This article contains major sections of text from the very detailed article Arabic alphabet from the French Wikipedia, which has been partially translated into English.
