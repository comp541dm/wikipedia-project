The '''Aimaq''' (), also transliterated as ''Aimak'' or ''Aymaq'', are a collection of Persian-speaking nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes.Tom Lansford -''A bitter harvest: US foreign policy and Afghanistan'' 2003 Page 25 "The term Aimaq means "tribe" but the Aimaq people actually include several different ethnic groups. The classification has come to be used for a variety of nonaligned nomadic tribes" Aimaqs are found mostly throughout Pakistan mostly in the Kyber and Balochistan region and in the West Central highlands of Afghanistan, immediately to the north of Herat, and also to a much lesser amount in the Khorasan Province of Iran. They speak a number of subdialects of the Aimaq dialect of Persian, however some southern groups of Taymani and Maleki Aymaqs have adopted Pashto.Aimaks were originally known as ''chahar'' ("four") Aymaqs:  the Taimani (the main element in the population of Ghor), the Firozkohi, the Temuri, and the Jamshidi.  Other sources state that the Aimaq Hazara are one of the ''Chahar'', with the Temuri instead being of the "lesser Aimaqs" or ''Aimaq-e digar'' ("other Aimaqs") along with the Tahiri, Zuri, Maleki, and Mishmast.Origin and classificationThe word "Aymāq" is Mongolian meaning "tribe" or "grazing territory". Aimaq Hazara and Taimuri are most Mongoloid of the Aimaqs. The Temuri and Aimaq Hazaras live in yurts, whereas other Aimaqs live in traditional Afghan black tents.{| class="wikitable"|-! Name !!

They are largely Sunni Muslims, in contrast to the Hazara, who are mostly Shias. The Temuri Aimaqs are of Mongolian origin, apparent in their physical appearance and their housing (Mongolian-style yurts)."Afghanistan". Encyclopædia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2008. However, the Taimanis, Ferozkohis, and Jamshidis are of Iranian origin, and refer to themselves as Tajik; the majority of the Aimaqs in Afghanistan are of these latter three sub-groups.See also* Tajiks* Farsiwan* Persian-speakers of Afghanistan* Qara'unas* Hazara people* Taymani* Persian peopleReferencesFurther reading* Macgregor, ''Central Asia'', (Calcutta, 1871)External links**
