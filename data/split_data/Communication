Communicate;;'''Communication''' (from Latin ''commūnicāre'', meaning "to share") is the act of conveying intended meaning to another entity through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules. The basic steps of communication are the forming of communicative intent, message composition, message encoding, transmission of signal, reception of signal, message decoding and finally interpretation of the message by the recipient.The study of communication can be divided into communication studies, which concerns only human communication, and biosemiotics, which examines the communication of organisms in general. Communication is usually visual, auditory, or biochemical, while human communication is unique for its extensive use of language.Nonverbal communicationNonverbal communicationNonverbal communication describes the process of conveying meaning in the form of non-word messages. Examples of nonverbal communication include haptic communication, chronemic communication, gestures, body language, facial expression, eye contact, and how one dresses. Nonverbal communication also relates to intent of a message. Examples of intent are voluntary, intentional movements like shaking a hand or winking, as well as involuntary, such as sweating. Speech also contains nonverbal elements known as paralanguage, e.g. rhythm, intonation, tempo, and stress. There may even be a pheromone component. Research has shown that up to 55% of human communication may occur through non-verbal facial expressions, and a further 38% through paralanguage. It affects communication most at the subconscious level and establishes trust.  Likewise, written texts include nonverbal elements such as handwriting style, spatial arrangement of words and the use of emoticons to convey emotion.Nonverbal communication demonstrates one of Wazlawick's laws: you cannot not communicate.  Once proximity has formed awareness, living creatures begin interpreting any signals received. Some of the functions of nonverbal communication in humans are to complement and illustrate, to reinforce and emphasize, to replace and substitute, to control and regulate, and to contradict the denotative message.Verbal communicationEffective verbal or spoken communication is dependent on a number of factors and cannot be fully isolated from other important interpersonal skills such as non-verbal communication, listening skills and clarification.Human language can be defined as a system of symbols (sometimes known as lexemes) and the grammars (rules) by which the symbols are manipulated. The word "language" also refers to common properties of languages. Language learning normally occurs most intensively during human childhood. Most of the thousands of human languages use patterns of sound or gesture for symbols which enable communication with others around them.  Languages tend to share certain properties, although there are exceptions. There is no defined line between a language and a dialect. Constructed languages such as Esperanto, programming languages, and various mathematical formalism is not necessarily restricted to the properties shared by human languages.  Communication is two-way process not merely one-way.An Effective Communication Process*:• Use standard terminology when communicating information.• Request and provide clarification when needed.• Ensure statements are direct and unambiguous.• Inform the appropriate individuals when the mission or plans change.• Communicate all information needed by those individuals or teams external to the team.• Use nonverbal communication appropriately.• Use proper order when communicating information."Effective Communication." ''Be Influenced, Figure 7-1 Presents a Communication Model. SHANNON’S COMMUNICATIONS MODEL''(n.d.): n. pag. Web.″* for formal English-speaking groups''Elements of Communication Skills''CommunicationCommunication is a continuous or two-way process of reaching mutual understanding, in which participants not only exchange (encode-decode) information, news, ideas and feelings but also create and share meaning.'''“Communication is simply the act of transferring information from one place to another.”'''In general, communication is a means of connecting people or places. In business, it is a key function of management an organization cannot operate without communication between levels, departments and employees.'''Components of Communication Process'''The main components of communication process are as follows:# '''Context: -'''Communication is affected by the context in which it takes place. This context may be physical, social, chronological or cultural. Every communication proceeds with context. The sender chooses the message to communicate within a context.'''2. Sender / Encoder: -'''Sender / Encoder are a person who sends the message. A sender makes use of symbols (words or graphic or visual aids) to convey the message and produce the required response. Sender may be an individual or a group or an organization.'''3. Message''':-Message is a key idea that the sender wants to communicate. It is a sign that elicits the response of recipient. Communication process begins with deciding about the message to be conveyed. It must be ensured that the main objective of the message is clear.'''4. Medium:-'''Medium is a means used to exchange / transmit the message. The sender must choose an appropriate medium for transmitting the message else the message might not be conveyed to the desired recipients. The choice of appropriate medium of communication is essential for making the message effective and correctly.This choice of communication medium varies depending upon the features of communication.'''For instance:'''·       Written medium is chosen when a message has to be conveyed to a small group of people, while an oral medium is chosen when spontaneous feedback is required from the recipient as misunderstandings are cleared then and there.'''Recipient / Decoder:-'''Recipient / Decoder are a person for whom the message is intended / aimed / targeted. The degree to which the decoder understands the message is dependent upon various factors such as knowledge of recipient, their responsiveness to the message, and the reliance of encoder on decoder.'''5. Feedback:-'''Feedback is the main component of communication process as it permits the sender to analyze the efficacy of the message. It helps the sender in confirming the correct interpretation of message by the decoder. Feedback may be verbal or non-verbal. It may take written form also in form of memos, reports, etc.'''For Example:-'''·       You may realize you’re hungry and encode the following message to send to your roommate: “I’m hungry. Do you want to get pizza tonight?” You are '''sender''' as you share your '''message''' (“I’m hungry. Do you want to get pizza tonight?”) to another.596x596px·       Your roommate is a '''receiver''' as he receives the message; he decodes your communication and turns it back into thoughts in order to make meaning out of it.·       Then your roommate response or reply your message. So its '''feedback.''' It may be positive or negative that he will give you pizza or not. Feedback is essential element of communication.·        Air is used as '''medium''' as by air your message transmits·       Of course, we don’t just communicate verbally—we have various options, or channels for communication. Encoded messages are sent through a channelThe sensory route on which a message travels., or a sensory route on which a message travels, to the receiver for decoding.·        If your roommate has headphones on and is engaged in a video game, you may need to get his attention by waving your hands before you can ask him about dinner.Business communicationBusiness communicationBusiness communications is used for a wide variety of activities including, but not limited to: strategic communications planning, media relations, public relations (which can include social media, broadcast and written communications, and more), brand management, reputation management, speech-writing, customer-client relations, and internal/employee communications.Companies with limited resources may choose to engage in only a few of these activities, while larger organizations may employ a full spectrum of communications. Since it is difficult to develop such a broad range of skills, communications professionals often specialize in one or two of these areas but usually have at least a working knowledge of most of them. By far, the most important qualifications communications professionals can possess are excellent writing ability, good 'people' skills, and the capacity to think critically and strategically.Family communicationFamily communication is the study and practice of the communication perspective in a broadly defined family, with intimacy and trusting relationship.Turner, L. H., ; West, R. L. (2013). ''Perspectives on family communication''. Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill. The main goal of family communication is to understand the interactions of family and the pattern of behaviors of family members in different circumstances.Family communication study looks at topics such as family rules, family roles or family dialectics and how those factors could affect the communication between family members. Researchers develop theories to understand communication behaviors. Family communication study also digs deep into certain time periods of family life such as marriage, parenthood or divorce and how communication stands in those situations. It is important for family members to understand communication as a trusted way which leads to a well constructed family.Barriers to effective human communicationBarriers to effective communication can retard or distort the message and intention of the message being conveyed which may result in failure of the communication process or an effect that is undesirable. These include filtering, selective perception, information overload, emotions, language, silence, communication apprehension, gender differences and political correctnessRobbins, S., Judge, T., Millett, B., ; Boyle, M. (2011). Organisational Behaviour. 6th ed. Pearson, French's Forest, NSW p315-317.This also includes a lack of expressing "knowledge-appropriate" communication, which occurs when a person uses ambiguous or complex legal words, medical jargon, or descriptions of a situation or environment that is not understood by the recipient.* '''Physical barriers.''' Physical barriers are often due to the nature of the environment. An example of this is the natural barrier which exists if staff are located in different buildings or on different sites. Likewise, poor or outdated equipment, particularly the failure of management to introduce new technology, may also cause problems. Staff shortages are another factor which frequently causes communication difficulties for an organization.* '''System design.''' System design faults refer to problems with the structures or systems in place in an organization. Examples might include an organizational structure which is unclear and therefore makes it confusing to know whom to communicate with. Other examples could be inefficient or inappropriate information systems, a lack of supervision or training, and a lack of clarity in roles and responsibilities which can lead to staff being uncertain about what is expected of them.* '''Attitudinal barriers.''' Attitudinal barriers come about as a result of problems with staff in an organization. These may be brought about, for example, by such factors as poor management, lack of consultation with employees, personality conflicts which can result in people delaying or refusing to communicate, the personal attitudes of individual employees which may be due to lack of motivation or dissatisfaction at work, brought about by insufficient training to enable them to carry out particular tasks, or simply resistance to change due to entrenched attitudes and ideas.* '''Ambiguity of words/phrases.''' Words sounding the same but having different meaning can convey a different meaning altogether. Hence the communicator must ensure that the receiver receives the same meaning. It is better if such words are avoided by using alternatives whenever possible.* '''Individual linguistic ability.''' The use of jargon, difficult or inappropriate words in communication can prevent the recipients from understanding the message. Poorly explained or misunderstood messages can also result in confusion. However, research in communication has shown that confusion can lend legitimacy to research when persuasion fails. - Retrieved December 18th, 2009* '''Physiological barriers.''' These may result from individuals' personal discomfort, caused—for example—by ill health, poor eyesight or hearing difficulties.* '''Cultural differences.''' These may result from the cultural differences of communities around the world, within an individual country (tribal/regional differences, dialects etc.), between religious groups and in organisations or at an organisational level - where companies, teams and units may have different expectations, norms and idiolects. Families and family groups may also experience the effect of cultural barriers to communication within and between different family members or groups. For example: words, colours and symbols have different meanings in different cultures. In most parts of the world, nodding your head means agreement, shaking your head means no, except in some parts of the world.* '''Bypassing.''' These happens when the communicators (sender and the receiver) do not attach the same symbolic meanings to their words. It is when the sender is expressing a thought or a word but the receiver take it in a different meaning. For example- ASAP, Rest room* '''Technological multi-tasking and absorbency.''' With a rapid increase in technologically-driven communication in the past several decades, individuals are increasingly faced with condensed communication in the form of e-mail, text, and social updates.  This has, in turn, led to a notable change in the way younger generations communicate and perceive their own self-efficacy to communicate and connect with others. With the ever-constant presence of another "world" in one's pocket, individuals are multi-tasking both physically and cognitively as constant reminders of something else happening somewhere else bombard them.  Though perhaps too new of an advancement to yet see long-term effects, this is a notion currently explored by such figures as Sherry Turkle.Fear of being criticized is a major factor that prevents good communication. If we exercise simple practices to improve our communication skill, we can become effective communicators. For example, read an article from the newspaper or collect some news from the television and present it in front of the mirror. This will not only boost your confidence, but also improve your language and vocabulary.Nonhuman communicationBiosemioticsEvery information exchange between living organisms— i.e. transmission of signals that involve a living sender and receiver can be considered a form of communication; and even primitive creatures such as corals are competent to communicate. Nonhuman communication also include cell signaling, cellular communication, and chemical transmissions between primitive organisms like bacteria and within the plant and fungal kingdoms.AnimalsThe broad field of animal communication encompasses most of the issues in ethology. Animal communication can be defined as any behavior of one animal that affects the current or future behavior of another animal. The study of animal communication, called ''zoo semiotics'' (distinguishable from anthroposemiotics, the study of human communication) has played an important part in the development of ethology, sociobiology, and the study of animal cognition. Animal communication, and indeed the understanding of the animal world in general, is a rapidly growing field, and even in the 21st century so far, a great share of prior understanding related to diverse fields such as personal symbolic name use, animal emotions, animal culture and learning, and even sexual conduct, long thought to be well understood, has been revolutionized. A special field of animal communication has been investigated in more detail such as vibrational communication.Plants and fungiCommunication is observed within the plant organism, i.e. within plant cells and between plant cells, between plants of the same or related species, and between plants and non-plant organisms, especially in the root zone. Plant roots communicate with rhizome bacteria, fungi, and insects within the soil. These interactions are governed by syntactic, pragmatic, and semantic rules, and are possible because of the decentralized "nervous system" of plants. The original meaning of the word "neuron" in Greek is "vegetable fiber" and recent research has shown that most of the microorganism plant communication processes are neuron-like. Plants also communicate via volatiles when exposed to herbivory attack behavior, thus warning neighboring plants. In parallel they produce other volatiles to attract parasites which attack these herbivores. In stress situations plants can overwrite the genomes they inherited from their parents and revert to that of their grand- or great-grandparents.Fungi communicate to coordinate and organize their growth and development such as the formation of Marcelia and fruiting bodies. Fungi communicate with their own and related species as well as with non fungal organisms in a great variety of symbiotic interactions, especially with bacteria, unicellular eukaryote, plants and insects through biochemicals of biotic origin. The biochemicals trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner, while if the same chemical molecules are not part of biotic messages, they do not trigger the fungal organism to react. This implies that fungal organisms can differentiate between molecules taking part in biotic messages and similar molecules being irrelevant in the situation. So far five different primary signalling molecules are known to coordinate different behavioral patterns such as filamentation, mating, growth, and pathogenicity. Behavioral coordination and production of signaling substances is achieved through interpretation processes that enables the organism to differ between self or non-self, a biotic indicator, biotic message from similar, related, or non-related species, and even filter out "noise", i.e. similar molecules without biotic content.Bacteria quorum sensingCommunication is not a tool used only by humans, plants and animals, but it is also used by microorganisms like bacteria. The process is called quorum sensing. Through quorum sensing, bacteria are able to sense the density of cells, and regulate gene expression accordingly.  This can be seen in both gram positive and gram negative bacteria.This was first observed by Fuqua ''et al.'' in marine microorganisms like ''V. harveyi'' and ''V. fischeri''.Anand, Sandhya. ''''.

E., ; Weaver, W. (1949). ''The mathematical theory of communication''. Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press The original model was designed to mirror the functioning of radio and telephone technologies. Their initial model consisted of three primary parts: sender, channel, and receiver. The sender was the part of a telephone a person spoke into, the channel was the telephone itself, and the receiver was the part of the phone where one could hear the other person. Shannon and Weaver also recognized that often there is static that interferes with one listening to a telephone conversation, which they deemed noise.In a simple model, often referred to as the transmission model or standard view of communication, information or content (e.g. a message in natural language) is sent in some form (as spoken language) from an emisor/ sender/ encoder to a destination/ receiver/ decoder. This common conception of communication simply views communication as a means of sending and receiving information. The strengths of this model are simplicity, generality, and quantifiability. Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver structured this model based on the following elements:# An information source, which produces a message.# A transmitter, which encodes the message into signals# A channel, to which signals are adapted for transmission# A noise source, which distorts the signal while it propagates through the channel# A receiver, which 'decodes' (reconstructs) the message from the signal.# A destination, where the message arrives.Shannon and Weaver argued that there were three levels of problems for communication within this theory.:The technical problem: how accurately can the message be transmitted?:The semantic problem: how precisely is the meaning 'conveyed'?:The effectiveness problem: how effectively does the received meaning affect behavior?Daniel ChandlerDaniel Chandler, "The Transmission Model of Communication", [Aber.ac.uk] critiques the transmission model by stating::It assumes communicators are isolated individuals.:No allowance for differing purposes.:No allowance for differing interpretations.:No allowance for unequal power relations.:No allowance for situational contexts.In 1960, David Berlo expanded on Shannon and Weaver's (1949) linear model of communication and created the SMCR Model of Communication.Berlo, D. K. (1960).'' The process of communication''. New York, New York: Holt, Rinehart, ; Winston.  The Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver Model of communication separated the model into clear parts and has been expanded upon by other scholars.Communication is usually described along a few major dimensions: Message (what type of things are communicated), source / emisor / sender / encoder (by whom), form (in which form), channel (through which medium), destination / receiver / target / decoder (to whom), and Receiver. Wilbur Schram (1954) also indicated that we should also examine the impact that a message has (both desired and undesired) on the target of the message.Schramm, W. (1954). How communication works. In W. Schramm (Ed.), ''The process and effects of communication'' (pp. 3–26). Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press.  Between parties, communication includes acts that confer knowledge and experiences, give advice and commands, and ask questions. These acts may take many forms, in one of the various manners of communication. The form depends on the abilities of the group communicating. Together, communication content and form make messages that are sent towards a destination. The target can be oneself, another person or being, another entity (such as a corporation or group of beings).Communication can be seen as processes of information transmission governed by three levels of semiotic rules:# Pragmatic (concerned with the relations between signs/expressions and their users)# Semantic (study of relationships between signs and symbols and what they represent) and# Syntactic (formal properties of signs and symbols).Therefore, communication is social interaction where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and a common set of semiotic rules. This commonly held rule in some sense ignores autocommunication, including intrapersonal communication via diaries or self-talk, both secondary phenomena that followed the primary acquisition of communicative competences within social interactions.In light of these weaknesses, Barnlund (2008) proposed a transactional model of communication.  The basic premise of the transactional model of communication is that individuals are simultaneously engaging in the sending and receiving of messages.In a slightly more complex form a sender and a receiver are linked reciprocally. This second attitude of communication, referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view, focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted. Communication is viewed as a conduit; a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself. A particular instance of communication is called a speech act. The sender's personal filters and the receiver's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions, cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents. In the presence of "communication noise" on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. One problem with this encode-transmit-receive-decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a codebook, and that these two code books are, at the very least, similar if not identical.  Although something like code books is implied by the model, they are nowhere represented in the model, which creates many conceptual difficulties.Theories of coregulation describe communication as a creative and dynamic continuous process, rather than a discrete exchange of information. Canadian media scholar Harold Innis had the theory that people use different types of media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different possibilities for the shape and durability of society (Wark, McKenzie 1997). His famous example of this is using ancient Egypt and looking at the ways they built themselves out of media with very different properties stone and papyrus. Papyrus is what he called 'Space Binding'. it made possible the transmission of written orders across space, empires and enables the waging of distant military campaigns and colonial administration. The other is stone and 'Time Binding', through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their authority generation to generation, through this media they can change and shape communication in their society (Wark, McKenzie 1997).NoiseIn any communication model, noise is interference with the decoding of messages sent over a channel by an encoder. There are many examples of noise:* '''Environmental noise.''' Noise that physically disrupts communication, such as standing next to loud speakers at a party, or the noise from a construction site next to a classroom making it difficult to hear the professor.* '''Physiological-impairment noise.''' Physical maladies that prevent effective communication, such as actual deafness or blindness preventing messages from being received as they were intended.* '''Semantic noise.''' Different interpretations of the meanings of certain words. For example, the word "weed" can be interpreted as an undesirable plant in a yard, or as a euphemism for marijuana.* '''Syntactical noise.''' Mistakes in grammar can disrupt communication, such as abrupt changes in verb tense during a sentence.* '''Organizational noise.''' Poorly structured communication can prevent the receiver from accurate interpretation. For example, unclear and badly stated directions can make the receiver even more lost.*'''Cultural noise.''' Stereotypical assumptions can cause misunderstandings, such as unintentionally offending a non-Christian person by wishing them a "Merry Christmas".* '''Psychological noise.''' Certain attitudes can also make communication difficult. For instance, great anger or sadness may cause someone to lose focus on the present moment. Disorders such as autism may also severely hamper effective communication.Communication as academic disciplineCommunication studiesSee alsoTechnology* Advice* Augmentative and alternative communication* Communication rights* Data communication* Four Cs of 21st century learning* Human communication´* ''Inter Mirifica''* Ishin-denshin* Sign system* Small talk* SPEAKING* Telecommunication* Telepathy* UnderstandingReferencesFurther reading* Innis, Harold.
