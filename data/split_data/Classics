Classic bookClassicist styleFile:Homeros Caetani Louvre Ma440 n2.jpg|right|thumb|Bust of Homer, the ancient Greek epic poet'''Classics''' (also '''Classical Studies''') is the study of the languages, literature, laws, philosophy, history, art, archaeology and other material culture of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome; especially during Classical Antiquity (ca. BCE 600– AD 600). Traditionally, the study of Classical literature (Greek and Roman) was the principal study of the humanities.EtymologyThe word ''classics'' is derived from the Latin adjective ''classicus'', meaning "belonging to the highest class of citizens."History of the Western ClassicsThe first “Classic” writer was Aulus Gellius, a 2nd-century Roman writer who, in the miscellany ''Noctes Atticae'' (19, 8, 15), refers to a writer as a ''Classicus scriptor, non proletarius'' (“A distinguished, not a commonplace writer”). Such classification began with the Greeks’ ''ranking'' their cultural works, with the word ''canon'' (“carpenter’s rule”). Moreover, early Christian Church Fathers used ''canon'' to rank the authoritative texts of the New Testament, preserving them, given the expense of vellum and papyrus and mechanical book reproduction, thus, being comprehended in a ''canon'' ensured a book’s preservation as the best way to retain information about a civilization. Contemporarily, the  Western canon defines the best of Western culture. In the ancient world, at the Alexandrian Library, scholars coined the Greek term ''Hoi enkrithentes'' (“the admitted”, “the included”) to identify the writers in the canon.According to Werner Jaeger, the method of study in the Classical World was “Philo’s Rule”: (lit.: "strike the divine coin anew")—the law of ''strict continuity'' in preserving words and ideas.Werner Jaeger, ''Paideia'', Eng. trans. 1939–44, vol. 2, p.xii. Although the definitions of words and ideas might broaden, ''continuity'' (preservation) requires retention of their ''original'' arete (excellence, virtue, goodness). “Philo’s Rule” imparts intellectual and aesthetic ''appreciation'' of “the best, which has been thought and said in the world”.  Oxford classicist Edward Copleston said that classical education “communicates to the mind...a high sense of honour, a disdain of death in a good cause, [and] a passionate devotion to the welfare of one’s country”,Edward Copleston, ''The Victorians and Ancient Greece,'' Richard Jenkyns, 60. thus concurring with Cicero that: “All literature, all philosophical treatises, all the voices of antiquity are full of examples for imitation, which would all lie unseen in darkness without the light of literature”.Marcus Tullius Cicero, "The Speech for Aulus Licinius Archias, the Poet", translated from Latin to English by C. D. Yonge (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1856)Legacy of the classical worldThe classical languages of the Ancient Mediterranean world influenced every European language, imparting to each a learned vocabulary of international application. Thus, Latin grew from a highly developed cultural product of the Golden and Silver eras of Latin literature to become the ''international lingua franca'' in matters diplomatic, scientific, philosophic and religious, until the 17th century. In turn, the classical languages ''continued'', Latin evolved into the Romance languages and Ancient Greek into Modern Greek and its dialects. In the specialised science and technology vocabularies, the influence of Latin and Greek is notable.  Ecclesiastical Latin, the Roman Catholic Church’s official tongue, remains a living legacy of the classical world to the contemporarys world.Sub-disciplines within the classicsOne of the most notable characteristics of the modern study of classics is the diversity of the field. Although traditionally focused on ancient Greece and Rome, the study now encompasses the entire ancient Mediterranean world, thus expanding their studies to Northern Africa and parts of the Middle East.PhilologyPhilologyClassical Philology (journal)There is a surviving tradition of Latin philology in Western culture connecting the Roman Empire with the Early Modern period.see e.g.  George A. Kennedy, ''Classical Rhetoric and Its Christian and Secular Tradition from Ancient to Modern Times'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1999, 2nd edition), .The philology of Greek survived in the Byzantine Empire until the fall of Constantinople, and was re-introduced in Western Europe in the Renaissance.Classical philology was a major preoccupation of the 19th-century German;; education system, which became "the paradigm for higher education" throughout Western culture.Although less dominant than it used to be, philology retains a central role in classical studies.see e.g. Richard F. Thomas, "Past and Future in Classical Philology," in ''On Philology'' (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1990), pp.66–74One definition of classical philology describes it as "the science which concerns itself with everything that has been transmitted from antiquity in the Greek or Latin language. The object of this science is thus the Graeco-Roman, or Classical, world to the extent that it has left behind monuments in a linguistic form."or alternatively as   "the careful study of the literary and philosophical texts of the ancient Greek and Roman worlds."Before the invention of the printing press, texts were reproduced by hand and distributed haphazardly. As a result, extant versions of the same text often differ from one another. Some classical philologists, known as textual critics, seek to synthesize these defective texts to find the most accurate version.Important scholars in classical philology included Eduard Norden, Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Franz Boll and Károly Kerényi.ArchaeologyClassical archaeologyClassical archaeology is the investigation of the physical remains of the great Mediterranean civilizations of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. The archaeologists’ research make available information that provides a counter or complement to the extant literary and linguistic cultural artifacts explored by philology. Likewise, archaeologists rely upon the philology of ancient literatures in exploring historic and cultural contexts among the classic-era remains of Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome.Art historyArt historySome art historians focus their study of the development of art on the classical world. Indeed, the art and architecture of Ancient Rome and Greece is very well regarded and remains at the heart of much of our art today. For example, Ancient Greek architecture gave us the Classical Orders: Doric order, Ionic order, and Corinthian order. The Parthenon is still the architectural symbol of the classical world.Greek sculpture is well known and we know the names of several Ancient Greek artists: for example, Phidias.Civilization and historyWith philology, archaeology, and art history, scholars seek understanding of the history and culture of a civilisation, through critical study of the extant literary and physical artefacts, in order to compose and establish a ''continual'' historic narrative of the Ancient World and its peoples. The task is difficult, given the dearth of physical evidence; for example, Sparta was a leading Greek city-state, yet little evidence of it survives to study, and what is available comes from Athens, Sparta’s principal rival; like-wise, the Roman Empire destroyed most evidence (cultural artefacts) of earlier, conquered civilizations, such as that of the Etruscans.PhilosophyAncient philosophyPythagoras coined the word philosophy ("love of wisdom"), the work of the "Philosopher" who seeks understanding of the world. Thus, most classics scholars recognize that the roots of Western philosophy originate in Greek philosophy, the works of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics.Classical GreeceTimeline of ancient GreeceAncient Greece is the civilization belonging to the period of Greek history lasting from the Archaic period of the 8th to 6th centuries BC to 146 BC and the Roman conquest of Greece after the Battle of Corinth. At the center of this time period is Classical Greece, which flourished during the 5th to 4th centuries BC, at first under Athenian leadership successfully repelling the military threat of Persian invasion. The Athenian Golden Age ends with the defeat of Athens at the hands of Sparta in the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC.Classical Greek culture had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire, which carried a version of it to many parts of the Mediterranean region and Europe, for which reason Classical Greece is generally considered to be the seminal culture which provided the foundation of Western civilization.Language in ancient GreeceKoine GreekAncient Greek is the historical stage in the development of the Greek language spanning the Archaic (c. 9th–6th centuries BC), Classical (c. 5th–4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic (c. 3rd century BC– 6th century AD) periods of ancient Greece and the ancient world. It is predated in the 2nd millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. Its Hellenistic phase is known as Koine ("common") or Biblical Greek, and its late period mutates imperceptibly into Medieval Greek. Koine is regarded as a separate historical stage of its own, although in its earlier form it closely resembles Classical Greek. Prior to the Koine period, Greek of the classic and earlier periods included several regional dialects.Ancient Greek was the language of Homer and of classical Athenian historians, playwrights, and philosophers. It has contributed many words to English vocabulary and has been a standard subject of study in Western educational institutions since the Renaissance. Latinized forms of Ancient Greek roots are used in many of the scientific names of species and in scientific terminology.Ancient Greek literatureAncient Greek literatureAlfred North Whitehead once claimed that all of philosophy is but a footnote to Plato. To suggest that all of Western literature is no more than a footnote to the writings of ancient Greece is an exaggeration, but it is nevertheless true that the Greek world of thought was so far-ranging that there is scarcely an idea discussed today not already debated by the ancient writers.  At the beginning of Greek literature stand the two monumental works of Homer, the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey''. The Greeks invented the epic and lyric forms of tragedy and used them skillfully. They also invented drama and produced masterpieces that are still reckoned as drama's crowning achievement. Like tragedy, comedy arose from a ritual in honor of Dionysus, but in this case the plays were full of frank obscenity, abuse, and insult. At Athens, the comedies became an official part of the festival celebration in 486 BC, and prizes were offered for the best productions.Two historians flourished during Greece's classical age: Herodotus and Thucydides. Herodotus is commonly called the father of history, and his "History" contains the first truly literary use of prose in Western literature. Of the two, Thucydides was the more careful historian. His critical use of sources, inclusion of documents, and laborious research made his History of the Peloponnesian War a significant influence on later generations of historians. The greatest achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy. There were many Greek philosophers, but three names tower above the rest: Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. It is impossible to calculate the enormous influence these thinkers have had on Western society .Greek mythology and religionReligion in Ancient GreeceGreek mythology is the body of myths and legends belonging to the ancient Greeks concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. They were a part of religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to the myths and study them in an attempt to throw light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece, its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.Greek religion encompasses the collection of beliefs and rituals practiced in ancient Greece in the form of both popular public religion and cult practices. These different groups varied enough for it to be possible to speak of Greek religions or "cults" in the plural, though most of them shared similarities. Also, the Greek religion extended out of Greece and out to other islands.Many Greek people recognized the major gods and goddesses: Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Apollo, Artemis, Aphrodite, Ares, Dionysus, Hephaestus, Athena, Hermes, Demeter, Hestia and Hera though philosophies such as Stoicism and some forms of Platonism used language that seems to posit a transcendent single deity. Different cities often worshipped the same deities, sometimes with epithets that distinguished them and specified their local nature.Ancient Greek philosophyAncient Greek philosophyAncient Greek philosophy arose in the 6th century BC and continued through the Hellenistic period, at which point Ancient Greece was incorporated in the Roman Empire. It dealt with a wide variety of subjects, including political philosophy, ethics, metaphysics, ontology, logic, biology, rhetoric, and aesthetics.Many philosophers today concede that Greek philosophy has shaped the entire Western thought since its inception.  Clear, unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophers, to medieval Islamic philosophers, to the European Renaissance and Enlightenment.Technology of ancient GreeceAncient Greek technologyAncient Greek technology developed at an unprecedented speed during the 5th century BC, continuing up to and including the Roman period, and beyond. Inventions that are credited to the ancient Greeks such as the gear, screw, rotary mills, screw press, bronze casting techniques, water clock, water organ, torsion catapult and the use of steam to operate some experimental machines and toys and a chart to find prime numbers. Many of these inventions occurred late in the Greek period, often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war. However, peaceful uses are shown by their early development of the watermill, a device which pointed to further exploitation on a large scale under the Romans. They developed surveying and mathematics to an advanced state, and many of their technical advances were published by philosophers such as Archimedes and Hero.Classical RomeCulture of Ancient Rome;;{| class="wikitable"|-!
