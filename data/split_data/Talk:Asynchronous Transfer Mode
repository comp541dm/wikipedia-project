Virtual '''Channel''' IdentifiersThis article constantly refers to ATM using virtual circuits.  In ATM, "VC" stands for "Virtual Channel", not "Virtual Circuit" (although of course they are an example of the generic concept of virtual circuits). LachlanA 03:15, 31 January 2007 (UTC):I think it depends on the exact acronym being used. For instance: VCC = Virtual Channel Connection, while PVC = Permanent Virtual Circuit/Connection. The standalone "VC" even seems to be "Virtual Connection" - *smirk*. But you are right, in the case of VCI, it is "Virtual Channel Identifier". (All claims) Based on [this Cisco ATM guide]. -; See section "VC Merge" 11-8 for a "VC" definition. Regarding "connection" vs "circuit", see page 21: "over virtual connections, sometimes called virtual circuits", so it seems both terms "virtual circuit" and "virtual connection" are ok. However it is highly confusing, the article should use only one style and explain it. Of course claims to abbreviations make only sense when founded on a reliable source.--Methossant (talk) 01:08, 2 June 2011 (UTC)Cell/payload sizeThis seems like a typo, but as I know next to nothing about ATM myself I'm checking here first: The para on the choice of payload size, 32 v. 64, ends with ''53 bytes was chosen as a compromise between the two sides'' - this seems to conflate the payload and total cell size - would it better be "48 bytes was chosen..."? The following text then mentions the 5-byte routing and total of 53 - Royan 22:41, 13 February 2007 (UTC)Jitter not the only reason for small fixed-sized packets (cells)When engineers were developing X.25 some were already working on digital voice. They realized that time was being lost while the first codec was converting analog data into digial, and that this time loss was proportional to packet size. So the ideal packet size for voice was somewhere between one bit and one byte but the pragmatic demands of the day set it to 128 bytes. Also at that time, pressure from the computer industry demanded larger packets so packet size grew to 4096 (I don't recall it being higher but may be wrong). Jumping back to ATM, certain networks with larger variable-length packets (like Ethernet) made network environments very unpredictable. So just switching to samll fixed size packets (called cells) made ATM networks much more deterministic. Of course, engineers added lots of other stuff to the technology like non-blocking fabrics and QOS to make these networks even more useful.--Neilrieck 13:41, 4 March 2007 (UTC)قاقا باقاP-NNI is link state but not necessarily shortest-pathThe P-NNI standard specifies the exchange of link state information, similar to what IS-IS and OSPF do.  It has more levels of hierarchy, and more metrics, but the basic approach is similar.However, it does '''not''' specify the routing algorithm, i.e., the algorithm that picks the path for a particular destination.  The reason is that this is not necessary; SVC setup uses source routing, so there is no need for the switches to agree on what the chosen route will be for a given destination.  Connectionless switches require agreement to avoid loops, but ATM SVC setup does not.  So the standard leaves this aspect open to implementers' choice.Obviously, it's to be expected that some algorithm similar to Dijkstra's algorithm will be used to determine the path for a particular connection, but it's not correct to say that the standard "uses the same shortest path algorithm used by OSPF..." Paul Koning 17:01, 2 May 2007 (UTC)Call admissionThe article says "To admit a call first a VPC has to be established. This will guarantee the correct routing from end to end."  This is incorrect.  In the signaling for SVC setup, the route is specified (see my comment above on P-NNI).  It does not require a pre-existing VPC, for routing or for any other purpose.  A call is admitted if the admission control algorithm decides to admit the call, normally because the resources the call asks for (in the signalling messages) are available.A network implementer can certainly use a VPC as a trunk, and route a new SVC over such a trunk if the source route allows it, but there's no requirement to do so; if a network does that, it's an internal matter that is invisible to the user.

If something is lowercase in an ITU title, you can be sure it's definitely a common noun, and carefully edited publications like Britannica also lowercase it.#Please do not revert again while the issue is being discussed here. --Espoo (talk) 12:53, 1 January 2010 (UTC)* The second page of I.150 is a list of titles.  Page i, 1 and 11 (the body of the text) has it capiltalized everywhere.  It is a proper noun and it why it was moved on 24 December 2009 from ''Asynchronous transfer mode'' to ''Asynchronous Transfer Mode''.  I would consider ''ATM Theory and Applications'', part of the McGraw Hill Signature Series on Telecommunications, to be a carefully edited work.  The same is true of ''Integrated Services Digital Network,'', ''Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network'', and ''Public Switched Telephone Network'' and many other topic areas in the field of communications, a handful of which from your recent edits you appear to wish to somehow make common nouns.  For example, your move of ''Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network'', to Broadband integrated services digital network is quite inappropriate: the only cited work in that article capitalizes ISDN, B-ISDN as well as ATM in their long forms throughout.* You might find it useful to think whether ATM (or any of these) are properly preceded by ''any'' or ''some''.  In telecommunications, we neither refer to ''any'' ATM nor ''some'' ATM; not ''any'' B-ISDN and not ''some'' B-ISDN.  Where it is obvious that we can say ''any'' telephone network, or ''some'' transport protocol, naturally.  Common nouns refer to a class.  ATM is not a class.  As a counter-example, consider ''cyclic redundancy code''.  CRC is not a proper noun.  It is a class of algorithms.  CRC-32c is a proper noun.  Another example:  ''Stream Control Transmission Protocol'' is a proper noun.* Another example: You will see that in the articles and in I.150 on ATM, ATM is written out capitalized as ''Asynchronous Transfer Mode'' and yet ''asynchronous time-division switching'' is not.  ''Asynchronous time-division switching'' is a common noun referring to the class of protocols of which ATM is a standardized, specific and particular instance.* You appear upset that I reverted your changes.  Once ever so often an editor goes stomping though these pages changing all of the proper nouns to lower case, causing an effort to change them all back.  To avoid bother, it is common to simply revert these without much comment.  Please consider all such changes as controversial and discuss your intended changes before making them to avoid causing unnecessary work for the regular contributors to these articles.  Please also consider reducing that work load by reverting your own recent changes to these articles.  Thank you.  — Dgtsyb (talk) 14:12, 1 January 2010 (UTC)# I.150 would not lowercase "asynchronous transfer mode" '''anywhere''' if it were a proper noun. The uppercase use on the other pages is always next to the acronym, as an explanation, and it's a widespread (bad) habit to explain acronyms of common nouns using uppercase. (Bad because it makes people believe these nouns are proper nouns.) Many if not most  use lowercase. Even many if not most of those ITU webpages with uppercase are using it when explaining the acronym (and then the non-professional writers/editors, who are only trained as engineers, often get confused and think they should do so elsewhere too). The very fact that carefully edited publications like Britannica use lowercase proves that ATM is a common noun.# Believe me, professional editors of encyclopedias know a lot more about grammar and spelling than engineers, and professional editors of reference works have extensive databases of citations at their disposal, on which they base their decisions. When they see, for example, that engineers use both lowercase and uppercase, professional editors use professional methods not at our disposal to decide which is more common and weight these based on whether these are well-edited "important" texts meant for the public or for internal use / colleagues / other engineers. You're right that some carefully edited technical (and legal) publications follow those professions' predilection for the baroque (18th century) practice of uppercasing Important Words even when they are common nouns, but MOS clearly says to avoid unnecessary capitalisation, in other words when other reliable sources use lowercase. Any attempts to use tests like "any" or "some" to decide whether something is a common noun amount to OR and are hopelessly amateurish. I hope you'll agree that it is quite common in English to uppercase words unnecessarily, even when they are not proper nouns. I hope you'll also agree that it is much less common for even amateur writers to erroneously lowercase proper nouns. This will perhaps help you realise how improbable is the idea that Britannica's editors with their training and huge citation database would erroneously lowercase a proper noun.::This has to be interpreted as an attack on the editors that revert your versions. You certainly don't show this 'professional editor' attribute, as you simply ignore the well founded reasoning that make nouns proper or common in technology. Kbrose (talk) 16:55, 1 January 2010 (UTC):::You are once again defending OR as better than following usage in reliable sources. If these use both uppercase and lowercase, MOS clearly states we should use lowercase, especially when general reference works like Britannica also use lowercase (not to mention most ITU and IEC webpages). Your aggressive removal of information is an attack, not my pointing out that we are not even supposed to try to be professional editors and definitely not try to be above them. (I am a professional editor BTW, but that is not why we should follow what I feel is clearly correct.)--Espoo (talk) 17:09, 1 January 2010 (UTC)# Your comments about some editors "stomping through" and others being "regular" indicate you have not understood one of the main ideas of WP and that you have a tendency to try to own articles. One of the reasons WP is so good is because people who spend a lot of time reading and writing about a topic may be blind to major problems, including general English spelling "rules" (habits) and to usage in general reference works and even on specialist websites like IEC and ITU. Infrequent visitors, especially when they provide reliable sources, should definitely not be simply shrugged off, reverted, and driven out. It's an especially bad idea to remove well sourced info. I would not have been so upset if you'd changed my edits instead of simply reverting all of them and thereby removing the info that ITU, IEC, Wired Magazine, and Britannica use lowercase. --Espoo (talk) 15:57, 1 January 2010 (UTC)It is quite obvious that User:Dgtsyb is '''not''' confused about these issues, as the editor just laid out explicitly and correctly the very good reasons that are used to establish proper and common noun usage not only in telecommunications, but the English language. The editor's explanations also carry weight based on his substantial and knowledgeable contributions to many of these articles.  Not following these criteria is absurd and would be controversial no matter what some reference text might use. It should be noted that many publications, for example, also incorrectly don't capitalize ''Internet'' out of some principle, but we still insist on proper usage on WP. The capitalization of ATM and ISDN fully spelled out titles is very notable and in-line with all of our proper noun usage on WP. Kbrose (talk) 16:06, 1 January 2010 (UTC):With your ridiculous comment "''no matter what some reference text might use''" you just inadvertently disqualified yourself and put your aggressive reverts into an even worse light because WP policy is very clearly that edits are to be based on reliable sources and specifically general reference sources such as Britannica and to a lesser degree on use in specialist literature and not at all on analyses by any editor, no matter how "substantial and knowledgeable" his contributions have been.:Your comments are simply absurd for other reasons too. There may be reasons for using uppercase, but Dgtsyb was clearly confused in using the illogical and erroneous reasoning "''lower case in the title which is simply ITU-T's house style for titles.''"

Kbrose (talk) 16:40, 1 January 2010 (UTC)::::Actually, I think that the non-introductory university level textbooks published by McGraw Hill and Prentice Hall (pillars with John Wiley in Engineering texts), are '''more''' reliable than ITU-T, ISO/IEC and Encyclopedia Britannica.  Of these, the text books are, I believe, ''secondary sources''; ITU-T and ISO/IEC, ''primary sources''; Encyclopedia Britannica, a ''tertiary source'': per WP:PRIMARY.  The EB entry, as a clear ''tertiary source'' cannot be used to support a position on whether the noun is common or proper as that is certainly not the topic of the EB entry.  The ''primary sources'' cannot be analyzed to determine a part of speech.  Therefore, it appears that Espoo's conclusions should be considered original research.  I do not believe that the removed mis-cited sources can be considered reliable sources for the conclusions advanced by Espoo.  — Dgtsyb (talk) 00:01, 2 January 2010 (UTC):::I specifically did ''not'' dismiss the single reliable source provided supporting uppercase. I simply pointed out that reference works like Britannica base their choices on a '''comprehensive view of usage''' whereas the editor of the McGraw Hill book is only one person's or a small group's personal preference. And MOS clearly says to avoid unnecessary uppercase, which is clearly the case when both are used by reliable sources. Since your view is fighting the combined windmills of Britannica, ITU, and IEC, the case is especially clear. --Espoo (talk) 16:50, 1 January 2010 (UTC)::::Where is Britannica's extensive research on the usage documented?  This sounds more like personal research to me.  ITU, except in titles which is a different matter (house style), does what other sources on topic do: namely expand it once, capitalized in the introduction and then simply use the acronym throughout the remainder of the document.  It saves both paper and ink that way.  This is what ''ITU-T Recommendation I.150'' does, as does ''ATM Theory and Applications'', McGraw Hill, ''ATM Volume III, Internetworking with ATM'', Prentice Hall.  ISO/IEC does the same thing in, for example, ISO/IEC 13246:1997(E) and ISO/IEC 13247:1997(E).

Asynchronous Transfer Mode is a specific standard and can only be thought of as a proper noun and must, therefore, be capitalised. As one cannot guarantee that other authors have correctly followed syntactical requirements, one should not base their argument on common usage. One should instead base their argument on syntactical principals. From this perspective, only capitalised ATM is permissible. This approach may seem contrary to WP philosophy, however, it is the only way to resolve conflicts such as this where common usage is often grammatically incorrect.Internet/internet, as mentioned earlier, being another example. --Spuzzdawg (talk) 22:42, 18 December 2010 (UTC)This article needs help.I added a few references and starting adding inline citations supporting the copy, but didn't make it past the lede.

(The speed of 155 Mbit/s matches STM-1 exactly.)  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/95.220.176.115|95.220.176.115 (talk) 01:37, 1 November 2010 (UTC);; ;;:I don't know this NIC, but there are two 155 Mbps (155 520 kbps) PHY standards given in ITU-T Recomendation I.432.2. One is SDH STM 1 (Sonet STS/OC 3c) and the other is the cell based phy, sometimes called the native ATM phy. This cell based phy has exactly the same cell throughput as STM 1 (149.760 Mbps), because an (extra) idle or PHY layer OAM cell is added after each 26 ATM layer (data) or idle cells. Graham Fountain 14:12, 1 December 2010 (UTC)Current Uses of ATMCan anybody add a section on the uses, particularly current uses, of ATM?It's my understanding that although it's not become the ubiquitous network standard is was touted as in the 90s (Fast/GB Ethernet did), it's still being used in telecoms infrastructures, and, I have been given to understand, some parts of broadband Internet access.Put somewhere near the start, this would, I think, be a useful and (possibly) interesting addition to indicate the relevance (or not) of this article. Graham Fountain 14:23, 1 December 2010 (UTC):You need to come up with a citation for such statements. My understanding is that ATM networks are being decommissioned and no new ATM equipment is being installed or built. --21:43, 4 May 2011 (UTC):Yes, citations needed. It is used in my DSL modem that I am using to make this edit, and suspect it is still the most common form of Internet access to residences. But the irony is that it has shifted to the edges of the network, out of the backbone, where it was originally envisioned. See below of course.

Needs to be well-cited and neutral of course. The source you point out might be included, although it specifically says "Gigabit ATM" and is 12 years ago. But its main point about how packet sizes should scale up is very relevant. Need to link to subsequent technologies that might have been influenced by ATM, perhaps HIPPI, various switched Ethernets over SONET-like PHYs, certainly Ipsilon Networks and Multiprotocol Label Switching.

Sorry, it is counterproductive. In case you were wondering, WP's house style is not at all unusual:::*::*::I trust you will drop the insults and rudeness. User:Tony1|'''Tony''';/font ; User talk:Tony1|(talk);/font ; 06:20, 16 September 2011 (UTC):::WP house style is to capitalize proper nouns, of which ''Asynchronous Transfer Mode'' is one.  It is interesting to note that your ngrams show it capitalized in 1907!  It looks like the tool mistakes '07 for 1907, which would skew the results about 2007.  Nevertheless, during the mid-90's when it was being developed, we (telecommunications engineers) talked much of the general aspects of the ''asynchronous transfer mode'' before it was specified, standardized, and named the ''Asynchronous Transfer Mode'' (we might have named it something else).  The earlier usage was widely published in working papers of the ITU (that were made into books) and in patent applications anticipating the standard.  But, if you read the previous discussion, above, you would have discovered that.  Also, as another editor noted, above, even common usage can be in error, so it is better to look to the context of the usage in the article to determine whether it is a proper noun or not.  In this case, as it is used in the article, it is a proper noun: it refers to the name of a specific protocol standard and not a generic class of operation.  This was identified by most of the editors in the last discussion. Being a proper noun, it must be capitalized according to WP policy.  — Dgtsyb (talk) 08:10, 16 September 2011 (UTC)::::Thanks for your post: is it owned by a particular company or individual, and is it used by more than one agent, without license, in telecom services? Proper noun says "A '''proper noun''' or '''proper name''' is a noun representing a unique entity (such as ''London'', ''Jupiter'', ''John Hunter'', or ''Toyota''), as distinguished from a '''common noun''', which represents a class of entities (or nonunique instance[s] of that class) ...". User:Tony1|'''Tony''';/font ; User talk:Tony1|(talk);/font ; 08:32, 16 September 2011 (UTC):::::In the article it is used predominantly to refer the specific protocol specified in ITU-T Recommendation I.361 (amoung others), and not the general aspects, class of techniques, nor broad technology.  The article is about the specific ITU-T standard and therefore the title is a proper noun.  In general, all sequences of descriptive words that are used as proper nouns in technology can be used both as a proper noun and as a general description.  From one of your ngram hits: ''"The asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) protocols are still in the process of being "fleshed out" but are anticipated to be of considerable importance in the future."''  In the quote it is used as a description of a class of protocols using the asynchronous transfer mode technique (as opposed to the synchronous transfer mode approach that the proposals replaced).  However, this WP article talks of the bits (specified in ITU-T Recommendation I.361) in the header, such as the HEC bit-field used for error correction, the cell size, and layout, which are specific to the ITU-T Recommendation I.361 standard adopted by the ITU.  As such, the article is about the specific ATM protocol adopted by the ITU-T and does not actually describe any of the competing asynchronous transfer mode proposals that led up to the adoption of this specific standard.:::::You will find this is true of many descriptive phrases which are also the proper names of specific standards.  I can talk of the ''Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network'' as specified in the ITU-T Q.2900-Series recommendations, or I can talk of the emergence of ''broadband integrated services digital network'' technologies, such as the ''asynchronous transfer mode'' technique.  I can talk of the need for a ''high-level data link control'' procedure, or talk of the ''High-Level Data Link Control'' (ISO/IEC Standards 3309:1988 and 4335:1988).  In general, many articles on WP refer to the specific standard as a proper noun, and experts in a domain that watch these documents for inaccuracy and vandalism get upset when someone (usually with no domain-specific knowledge) tries to down-case them.  There are, however, some articles, like ''Asynchronous communication'' which are general and don't describe a specific standard.  Knowing which, sometimes requires a technology expert, or at least someone that has often used the name in a sentence. — Dgtsyb (talk) 09:33, 16 September 2011 (UTC)* '''Support''' – although it usually refers to a specific protocol, there's little evidence in sources that it's a proper name.  About half of good sources use it in lower case in sentence context.  WP style is to do similarly.  The lead says ATM is "a technique"; it it's also the name of a specific protocol, we can mention that, and capitalize when we do if there's evidence that it's a proper name, but the article should be kept more general than that.  The ITU doc, ref 1, does not capitalize it. Dicklyon (talk) 16:54, 16 September 2011 (UTC)* '''Oppose''' although this is borderline. The lead implies the article is talking about the general concepts of modes for transfer that are asynchronous. But the article and almost all uses of the term do refer to a specific standard of the ITU-T. Actually a large family of standards, but they are all unified in the 53-byte cell size for example defined in specific documents for B-ISDN. I just downloaded the I.150 document of ref 1. Although it does not use capitals in the title for some reason, it does consistently capitalize in the text (along with all other nouns defined in it, but that is another point). So I would contrast this with digital subscriber line for example, which is the general concept of frequency modulation in bands above voice on telephone lines. I would call the generic technique "cell switching" and indeed that redirects to Cell relay, a generic article in lower case. Put another way, one could argue that the "transfer mode" of Ethernet is not synchronous, so an article about all "asynchronous transfer modes" (lower case) would have to include all those other protocols as well. The specific protocol layer defined in I.150 deserves its own article, and deserves to be a proper name to denote it is this specific one. W Nowicki (talk) 20:48, 16 September 2011 (UTC)::The only places that doc capitalizes "asynchronous transfer mode" is where it is defining the acronym ATM (which it does in 3 places); I'd go with the title.  Dicklyon (talk) 21:39, 16 September 2011 (UTC)*'''Oppose'''. Although ''asynchronous transfer mode'' may refer to a general technique, telecommunication folks (including myself) generally refer to it as a specific protocol using the well-known 53-byte cell sizes that is still widely used as a data transport mechanism in the backbone of traditional telephone providers, and which is also implemented in other networks such as satellite communication systems when intended for telephony. As such, it is a proper noun and by our rules should be capitalized. Nageh (talk) 20:51, 20 September 2011 (UTC)*'''Support''' This is not a proper name, just a term that is commonly up-cased to match the acronym. The MoS does not support that style. Use lower case. Joja;/font;lozzo;/font; 02:28, 21 September 2011 (UTC)::And what exactly is your rationale? Are you a telecom engineer? Do you have qualification to state this? Or is it just your ''opinion'' that you weigh in? I have provided arguments for why this needs to be upper-cased. Where are your arguments? Sincerely, Nageh (talk) 07:42, 21 September 2011 (UTC):::Why would he need qualifications, or need to be a telecomm engineer, to look at sources and comment on this?  As I pointed out above, many sources, including the official ITU doc, capitalize it where they define the acronym, and not otherwise.  There's no good reason to treat it as a proper name given such usage. Dicklyon (talk) 09:15, 21 September 2011 (UTC)::::(edit conflict, and then the phone range before I posted it) Nageh, perhaps Dicklyon's rationale supports what Joja is saying: "About half of good sources use it in lower case in sentence context. WP style is to do similarly." And Dicklyon, who invented what you're holding now, might have some credentials in the field. User:Tony1|'''Tony''';/font ; User talk:Tony1|(talk);/font ; 09:21, 21 September 2011 (UTC)::::It actually does not require expertise to determine whether a term has a generic meaning or a specific one. Compare ''the'' Internet (the global network of networks, which is based on TCP/IP) with ''an'' internet (a network of networks). Or ''a'' serial bus with ''the'' Universal Serial Bus. It is primarily a matter of grammar. If your argument is that ATM as a ''trademark'' would be written in lower-case letters that would be a different argument; but then, it is not a trademark but a specific protocol. I think this makes it quite clear; if not, I don't know what I can do to make it more clear. Nageh (talk) 11:14, 21 September 2011 (UTC):::::I agree on Internet and Universal Serial Bus, but not on Asychronous Transfer Mode; not even .  My disagreement is based on what I find in sources, not on any particular expertise that I might have.  Dicklyon (talk) 11:43, 21 September 2011 (UTC)::::::We all know the lack of adherence to grammar rules by technical documents – as Tony put it, they tend to upper-case every noun in sight. That this standard document does not follow this practice does not mean it is suddenly right. As I said, it is a matter of grammar: if we've got a proper noun it needs to be upper-cased. In this case, ATM refers to a specific protocol standardized by the ITU, and should be upper-cased. The generic meaning of "asynchronous transfer mode" would mean nothing else but "a mode using packet or cell-switched transmission" (in contrast to traditional (from the perspective of telephone operators) synchronous = connection-based transmission). But the generic meaning is not common at all: people say "packet switching", "cell switching", "packet-based transmission", etc. and not "asynchronous transfer".

No further edits should be made to this section.;/div;;;Do not capitalize terms just because they are referred to by acronymThis article up-cases most every term that has an acronym. This is common practice in technical literature but Wikipedia's MoS does not support it.

Joja;/font;lozzo;/font; 20:45, 21 September 2011 (UTC):Yup, and as I mentioned in the move discussion, if this article is about the specific protocol with 53-byte cells, not about the generic technique, then it needs to be written that way too. But also as above some are tough calls, so we should not spend time on brownian motion fighting over case, but perhaps fill out the article with citations, history of adoption, etc. W Nowicki (talk) 18:31, 24 September 2011 (UTC)Changes made by 194.237.142.10 - Corrections made to spelling and grammarThe changes made by 194.237.142.10 at 07:58, 26 September 2011, raise a number of questions. I was, initially, tempted to merely revert, but perhaps that would be a bit precipitous.Some of the changes don't matter to me, so I will not comment on them, but the following ones need some consideration:The change of the one spelling of "queueing" to "queuing" does beg the question of which is correct in this context, regarding the spelling of queueing theory. However, if "queueing" is right there, then some, many, or all of the "queuing"s in this article need to be changed.I think that the use of "continued" [source line 122] is wrong; though, otherwise, that edit is not contentious.I think that "potentially redundant" [source line 147] is, potentially, misleading, though I don't much like "discardable" either. However, the intention is more clear than implying that all cells with the CLP set are "potentially redundant" as opposed to "cells which may be discarded [down stream] in congested conditions" (from Cell Loss Priority) [oh no! another capitalized term].I like "the provisioner must build" in preference to "provisioned", as it more strongly implies an agent in the creation of PVCs and PVPs.It appears that 194.237.142.10 does not like "build" and "tear down", presumably as jargon. The question is, should the article be written in the common parlance of the technology, unless it is obviously confusing, which it is not.The use of "which" [source line 153] as a restrictive/defining relative pronoun is anathema to me, and, in my opinion, it really should be "that" or be preceded by a comma as a descriptive/non-defining relative pronoun [see Fowler's Modern English Usage, 1st ed, THAT, REL, p635]. Whatever the correctness of the original, change for the sake of it seems pointless.Of the ones I said I wouldn't comment on, it was my understanding that it is policy not to go around changing American spelling to British for the sake of it. [Don't start me off on "ise" vrs "ize" or the use of the serial comma though.]Anyway, any comments?Graham Fountain 16:07, 26 September 2011 (UTC): Be bold.  I don't see any problem with your proposed changes. — Dgtsyb (talk) 21:38, 26 September 2011 (UTC)
