Should German names be used in the List of the Bundeslands / in the articles about them? (please discuss this before writing articles using the German AND English names).:If they have English names we should use them - Sachsen and Bayern redirect to Saxony and Bavaria already. Are there English names for some of the others though?  --rmhermen:I don't think we should use German name (English name) and then redirect to the English named article. It would be better to say: English name (German name). Of cause only there where English names exist ;-) --Daniel Wiebelt::It seems more natural to me to put the English in parentheses, so that the main name given in each case i the page*, not to integrate them into the article.  --MichaelTinkler:changed --Daniel Wiebelt----As a Germanophile, I like the English version of the name as the Article title, but don't mind if the German is used in:German name = English name (whith special names of the inhabitants):Baden-Württembergaarlander (that's right in English without ä)We should also decide where we place the German names, because all Bundeslander articles should have the same structure. --Daniel Wiebelt:I suggest doing it as I did for Thuringia, but I don't think it matters too much. I do think we ought to try to do umlauts as HTML character entity references (e.g., ;amp;uuml;). If you do them in Latin-1, as you have above, they will display incorrectly for some people, because the pages are not marked as Latin-1. --Zundark, 2001 Nov 13::Rheinland_Pfalz = Rhineland-Palatinate:en that instances of such operations haveapparently been observed by Wikipedia:About, which are thecorresponding Wikipedia:Utilities?What is an Ümmerläuterer?
