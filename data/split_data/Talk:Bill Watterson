people of the United StatesDetailsWatterson published one book where he had the cartoon strips interspersed with commentary about them--kind of a DVD edition, I guess ;-) --and in that one he talks about his battle with his publisher over the format of the Sunday comics, and goes into some detail explaining what that format is and how it constrained him, as well as the protracted fight over it and his eventual victory.  I read that when the book first came out and don't have the details with me--can someone who knows them please add them?  --KQI have that book.  It's the tenth anniversary Calvin ; Hobbes collection.. I did mention his battles with the publisher... I didn't want to weigh the article down too heavily on those things though so i decided to leave out some of the less important details... ~ Jimmy LoOh, ok then.  Maybe you're right; I'm not sure how interesting all that would be for the layman.  --KQProbably more interesting than you're it giving credit for - Bill saw the writing on the wall concerning copyrights and started a minor revolution about how artists licensed their work to publishers and syndicates.  What we see in a lot of the self-published strips on the Internet was influenced by Watterson's actions and opinions.  --idiosynchronic, idiosynchronicATGmail.comA picture of C;H themselves can and should be included. Under copyright law examples of work may be quoted or shown for a reference purposes. Watterston's aversions are well known; but has he specifically asked Wikipedia to not show any image if C;H?  Since cartooning is a visual medium, what does it mean to not SHOW it?   —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/161.80.10.21|161.80.10.21 (talk) 13:17, 18 February 2010 (UTC);; ;;Pre C;H work?It would have been great for the article to have an example of his pre-C;H work; i.e. the political cartoons he did for the Cincinnati Post. Have these been published in any sort of collection? I can't recall having seen any of them, ever. Mortene 22:56, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)*Here's a great site that purports to have some early work of Watterson's.  You can see Watterson's unique style within them.Post C;H work?For an example of how Calvin maybe would have turned out look no further than by Tatsuya Ishida...  Personally I think this fits to a tee what Calvin would be like were he to grow up.  Irreverent, criticising faults in others but not seeing his own and having a complex relationship to authority.  And don't forget the girl he know he wants but he never can figure out for himself how to get...-- LindusI have had the pleasure of corresponding with Mr. Wattersons brother Tom. He used to run with a band in the late 80's and early 90's. He gave me 2 cassette tapes with different art on them both. He said that his brother had done the art under an assumed name, Fang Wampur (I think... I'll have to look at the tapes again). The art is nothing like the comic strips at all. In fact, it's rather dark, even compared to his Pre C;H work drawing political cartoons.-- wattersonphile  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/204.16.64.3|204.16.64.3 (talk) 15:25, 1 July 2008 (UTC);;; ;;Watterson's resemblenceI'm sure some of you have noticed this, but I just wanted to point out that Watterson looks very much like Calvin's dad, save for the mustache. Scorpionman 01:54, 7 October 2005 (UTC):Yeah, I've noticed that too. I think I remember reading somewhere that Watterson said none of the characters are based off his life, but the resemblance between himself and Calvin's dad is uncanny. Harksaw 14:43, 29 January 2007 (UTC)::This is part-speculation so I'm not saying this should be added, but there is at least one strip where in the Tenth Anniversary book he said, "This is my dad. No exaggeration." Perhaps he looks a lot like his dad who looks like Calvin's dad as well. -WarthogDemon 15:57, 4 July 2007 (UTC)Watterson pictureShould this page carry A picture of Watterson when it's well known he doesn't like publicity of most kinds?... Personally I probably would'nt include it, but I was just wondering if anyone else felt the same.I really don't see anything wrong with it.  It's not really publicity.  It is just a reference picture, so we can have some idea of what he looks like.I agree - the picture is very importaint. Scorpionman is right; minus the moustache, he's a dead ringer for Calvin's dad! Knowing that makes it a lot easier to see how Watterson uses Calvin's father in the strip as a mouthpiece for many of his own values. Harkenbane 17:40, 2 December 2005 (UTC): Despite his personal reclusiveness, Watterson is still a public figure. Iceberg3k 20:14, 9 December 2005 (UTC):: As there will likely never be a free picture of Watterson we probably should fair use one of the few extant ones. --BHC (talk) 10:59, 28 November 2007 (UTC)Someone should put back the photo of him that was once on the page. It would be a shame if someone deleted it just because Watterson is a recluse, which shouldn't matter here as Wikipedia hardly constitutes publicity.Tap1981 (talk) 22:24, 7 April 2013 (UTC)InaccuracyWatterson believes that art should not be judged by the medium for which it is created (i.e., that there is no "high" art or "low" art, just art)A nitpick, but I don't think the line in the parentheses is true. Whether art is "high" or "low" does not necessarily depend on the medium. Thoughts?-falqasBill Watterson no longer lives in Chagrin Falls, OH.  He moved to Cleveland Heights, OH in October of 2004.  I'd rather not provide the source for this as it reveals his full address.Silentmars 13:55, 9 February 2007 (UTC)Yeah, I made a huge mistake and wrote in his street address here on his Wiki page (not the house number), it took all of 1/2 a day to be removed. Personally, I would be mad if someone did that to me. Hindsight is 20/20. It's true though, he no longer lives in Chagrin Falls... this is speculation too, but maybe part of his decision to move was due to the public finding out where he lived in that small town and the idea that he would be crowded by fans on his doorstep for an autograph.-wattersonphileCalvin and Hobbes InfluenceMuch of the influence of Calvin and Hobbes comes from his childhood in Chagrin Falls.  The schoo's mascot is a Tiger and Mrs. Wormwood is based upon a teacher who still substitutes these days named Mrs. Maus.  You can often see the falls and the popcorn shop in his strip.TriviaI've removed the trivia tag, as the "trivia" section need only be tagged if the information itself is trivial.  Note that there is a difference between the meanings of the word trivial and trivia, and the information occuring in the section at present is not trivial.

I'm removing it because I don't really think it's appropriate for the Bill Watterson article, you know, to mention a popstar pretending to be his stalker. It's just bizarre, and hardly relevant, unless it was something publicly recognized, which it is not.:I'm also curious as to how to reword the Garfield thing. Watterson's only comment on Garfield that I'm aware of its that it is "consistent;" he never out-and-out trashed Garfield the way it sounds like he did, and he has said that the reason that he never licensed Calvin and Hobbes is that any merchandise presented to him seemed like it went against the spirit of the strip.:Let's try to keep the Watterson entry relevant only to things related to Watterson... the Watterson-stalking popstar could have put the name of any public figure in that song without changing its concept (and the song is not at all culturally important, it's like naming every song to mention the X-Men in the X-Men article), and what Watterson thinks of the comics' leading strip is hardly "trivia." 67.101.7.248 10:29, 21 June 2006 (UTC)::Coming in much later: I have a different take on the "family member" question.  I looked up the "C;H" Bill Watterson because I had run across a reference to another Bill Watterson (in this case, [William C. Watterson]), presently a professor of English at Bowdoin College -- and on comparing their online biographies, I find that both attended Kenyon College in the 1970s, some years apart.  Given that both William Wattersons are extensively published authors (albeit in different fields), and the Kenyon connection, I as a reader would find it useful to provide enough information to disambiguate the two men -- and not inappropriate to indicate whatever familial relationship might exist. -- (John C.

While I unfortunately haven't read all the strips ever published, I do have 5 albums and have seen many strips over the years, but as far as I can recall, have never seen the slightest reference to cycling, or even a bike - unless, of course, it is an American English term for racing downhill in a blur and flying off the edges of various things in a wagon, sled, or toboggan. Please put my mind at ease, or I'll have to slap a "citation needed" in there. Thanx, --Technopat 00:48, 25 February 2007 (UTC):You should slap it. User:Murgh|M;/font;URGH;/font; User talk:Murgh|disc.;/font; 02:09, 25 February 2007 (UTC):Calvin's dad is an avid biker. There are several strips that refer to this (interesting since they're some of the few strips in which C. doesn't appear at all). Gotterfunken 02:22, 25 February 2007 (UTC)Where he livesThe article formerly said he lived in Cleveland Heights, using citations from 1989 and 1990. I thought that wasn't up-to-date enough, so I did some research. A ''Washington Post'' article () says he moved from Chagrin Falls to a house in the City of Cleveland in 2005. This [Associated Press article] also has him moving out of Chagrin Falls in 2005. I updated the article accordingly.However, I did a search on Watterson on a Cuyahoga County government website (I'll leave out the details to respect his privacy) and found that someone named W.B. Watterson II, and whose wife's name begins with an "M," bought a house in Cleveland Heights in 2001. I'm not going to say where in Cleveland Heights (a town of 50,000), but being familiar with the area, I can tell you it's far more likely that a wealthy individual like Watterson, even one who lives modestly, lives at that address in Cleveland Heights than in any home in the City of Cleveland. (If he wasn't modest, he'd live in Hunting Valley or somewhere.) Almost all of the city is either ghetto or ethnic working-class, although some rich people may live in downtown condos.So I don't know what we should say about what city he lives in. -- Mwalcoff 02:08, 30 July 2007 (UTC):He has been hiding for a while now, and people have tried to track him down.ReferencesThe 14th reference, of Watterson's autobiography is down.

Both are completely different ideas, and one does not follow from the other. One can accept a distinction between "high" and "low" art without regard for the medium. For example, one can easily be of the opinion that there is both "high" and "low" art in the same medium, such as comics. One may alternatively consider different genres within the same medium as within the domain of "high" or "low" art respectively (dime novels, romance, pulp, Westerns, thriller/suspense or detective stories as "low" art, philosophical, experimental or speculative fiction as "high" art, classical music and jazz as "high" and pop, rock, rap or techno as "low" art).

The answer is of course yes., and* Is this benefit to the public enough to warrant disrespecting his clear wishes?  The answer is "I'm not sure."
