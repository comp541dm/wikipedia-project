;;The editing "Augustine of Hippo"Hello, my name is, Lindsey Walton. I have edited this article because it needed a little revising and it fit perfectly.I have no proof that this was his real name, and actually I know for a fact that this was not his name; but it seemeda very hilarious name to make up.I am sorry if I caused you any trouble , can you direct me to, how you say,"sandbox"? I've heard that I can"play" around in there.thank you.~Lindsey Walton~  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/2001:5B0:226A:ADB8:744C:1A59:9428:BC64|2001:5B0:226A:ADB8:744C:1A59:9428:BC64 (talk) 20:28, 5 May 2015 (UTC);;; ;;Likely wrong informationThe article states that:"Augustine's view of sexual feelings as sinful affected his view of women. For example he considered a man’s erection to be sinful, though involuntary,[145] because it did not take place under his conscious control."However, after having read all of Book 14 of the City of God (which is the reference of citation 145), I found nothing on men's erections being sinful. Thus, I think this should be removed or a new source should be found. Feel free to read Book 14, Chapter 17 or even all of Book 14 to see for yourself.Special:Contributions/66.227.159.219|66.227.159.219 (talk) 16:34, 12 June 2015 (UTC):Thank you for your comment. I agree, I don't find any such statement in the text. It may be that someone deduced that somehow from the paragraph, maybe some translations give a different impression, but there's definitely not an explicit statement that erections are sinful. I will remove the statement; if someone wants to argue that that's what Augustine meant, he/she will have to provide a secondary source for that. - Lindert (talk) 18:40, 12 June 2015 (UTC):Addendum: I also looked at the source cited in the following sentence, as the paragraph is presented as a connected whole, and found this: ''"In sexual attraction and intercourse, the male experiences the erection of his penis, which is not (as it would have been in paradise) under the control of his mind."'', the author then cites ''City of God'' 14:16, so she is saying that according to Augustine, erections did occur in paradise, before Adam had ever sinned, but that after the fall these erections became involuntary and connected to fleshly (sinful) lust, not that they are inherently sinful. She also quotes Augustine as saying that there is no sin in sexual intercourse for the purpose of procreation in marriage (p. 67, footnote 56). I have therefore removed the entire paragraph, as it would not make much sense without the part about erections. - Lindert (talk) 19:06, 12 June 2015 (UTC)Augustine as 'Roman Catholic'Given that the division of the church hasn't happened yet, it is simplistic to describe Augustine as an RC, especially as his mantle is strongly claimed by many Protestants. I'm not sure what the answer is, but I think it's worth some consideration!

Hippo Regius mentions (under Hippo Regius#Ecclesiastical history|§Ecclesiastical history) that there were seven and lists some (without in-line citation). Does anyone have any further information (either enough to make a new article, or as a section in an appropriate article? — Sasuke Sarutobi (talk) 14:32, 10 December 2015 (UTC)
