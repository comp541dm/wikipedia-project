ReflistEdaljiThe article states that Edalji was half-British, half-Indian.  It is not clear whether this describes citizenship or race; his parents lived and worked in England.Avocats (talk) 23:52, 28 September 2015 (UTC)FreemasonI note he appears in a Wikipedia list of Notable Freemasons, mentioned at foot of this page, but I see no reference to him being one in the body of the page. It would be more credible if published mention of him being a Mason could be given with citation and date.  If he was a Mason, that would have showed a break with his childhood Catholicism.Cloptonson (talk) 07:00, 12 March 2015 (UTC):Clearly his interest in Spiritualism was a break with Catholicism and a simple google search on "Arthur Conan Doyle freemason" finds plenty of information such as .

My objective was to give a wp:rs view by modern experts from a different discipline which may have been overlooked by more knowledgeable main contributors -something I quite often try to do.  In this case, it was half a sentence to show that his medical work could credibly be regarded as useful even today ; no contemporary description could show this.  I will further shorten the sentence as precise details are irrelevant and replace as per WP:BRD shortly.  Feel free to reposition it or further discuss.Regards JRPG (talk) 21:26, 24 May 2015 (UTC)Charles Altamont Doyle - English of Irish descent?As Charles Altamont Doyle was born and raised in England, surely this would make him as English as Wikipedia claims his son to have been Scottish? Saying he was "born in England" is rather different to the phraseology used to describe his son, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the author of the Sherlock Holmes stories. Bizarre double standards here, and a possible anti-English bias?(Special:Contributions/86.170.94.12|86.170.94.12 (talk) 01:30, 5 July 2015 (UTC)): What? Wiki bias? Surely you jest! Seriously, that is a fair question, especially in light of his traditional Irish middle name, which normally English would avoid using. --Special:Contributions/71.47.172.126|71.47.172.126 (talk) 12:07, 19 August 2015 (UTC)ACD regarded himself as an Anglo-Celt and was close to the Irish community in London.  He had a great interest in the Irish Question and ran as a Liberal Unionist, against Home Rule, on two occasions. He was a friend to the powerful, prime minister Balfour, in particular. Balfour, a Tory, was working towards a gradual devolution, hence the very significant Wyndham Land Act.  There should be a section on ADC and Ireland.  I am putting together a long article/book. There is significant material.  Moriarty has many ingredients but his appearance in certain years marks him as a Fenian. The Valley of Fear shows the different faces of the movement, as does His Last Bow.  Fenianism was a serious global threat to the British Empire.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Maelfreda (talk • Special:Contributions/Maelfreda|contribs) 07:06, 22 August 2015 (UTC);;; ;;
