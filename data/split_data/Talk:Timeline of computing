NotesThe Commodore 64 is listed as being introduced twice, in 1981 and 1986.  I know it was earlier than 1986, but am not sure of the correct date.  Anybody able to confirm the correct date?  -- Robert Merkel----XBox has been delayed to November 15.----Exactly where does this 64 TB figure for the 80386 come from? -- Taral----It is kind of semi-supportable. Each segment is up to 4GB, and you can have heaps of segments. It would be a total pain to use this, and hardly anyone ever tried, but it was not quite an outright lie, and it was useful for Intel marketing to claim a bigger address space than Motorola after the bucketing Intel had received for so many years about the small address space of their earlier chips. For practical purposes, the maximum virtual address space of the 386 is not quite 4GB.----COBOL was not developed by Grace Hopper, although she had a great deal of influence on the original specs. It was developed by a committee called up by the Department of Defense. And, she was not even a member of this committee. Her influence was through her development of its precursor Flow-Matic and due fact that a number of her associates did serve on this committee. RoseParks----Has the idea of a per-year timeline along the lines of Year X in science, Year X in music, etc. been suggested?  ;mdash;LarryGilbert 22:39, 2004 Mar 4 (UTC)----Pardon, but Kylix ISN'T a Programming Language: shouldn't be removed from that timeline?

AlanD 23:41, 4 February 2007 (UTC)yes timeline is complete mess Rohit:This timeline has the potential to be a beautiful piece of work.  The collisions need to be worked out.  Alatari 05:38, 29 July 2007 (UTC)::The Graphical Timeline is done with an image file. The 'collisions' are part of the image (?!). There is nothing to be done in the article, except to replace the image with a clearer one.

Now, the question: what was the computer in the Arrow cockpit ? It would be nice to recall that in the timeline.We all know that Apollo was also carrying an inboard computer which allowed the astronauts to perform some level of computations. Again, the same question applies.It would take some time before we could see computers in airplanes, we had to wait until de Airbus fly-by-wire for commercial ones. Again, the same question applies.Needs to be UpdatedWindows 8 needs to be added.
