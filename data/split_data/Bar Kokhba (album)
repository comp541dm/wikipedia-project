'''''Bar Kokhba''''' is a double album by John Zorn, recorded between 1994 and 1996. It features music from Zorn's ''Masada'' project, rearranged for small ensembles.ReceptionThe AllMusic review by Marc Gilman awarded the album 4Â½ stars noting that "While some compositions retain their original structure and sound, some are expanded and probed by Zorn's arrangements, and resemble avant-garde classical music more than jazz. But this is the beauty of the album; the ensembles provide a forum for Zorn to expand his compositions. The album consistently impresses".Gilman, M.  accessed July 26, 2011.Track listing''All compositions by John Zorn'';Disc One# "Gevurah" - 6:55# "Nezikin" - 1:51# "Mahshav" - 4:33# "Rokhev" - 3:10# "Abidan" - 5:19# "Sheloshim" - 5:03# "Hath-Arob" - 2:25# "Paran" - 4:48# "Mahlah" - 7:48# "Socoh" - 4:07# "Yechida" - 8:24# "Bikkurim" - 3:25# "Idalah-Abal" - 5:04;Disc Two# "Tannaim" - 4:38# "Nefesh" - 3:33# "Abidan" - 3:13# "Mo'ed" - 4:59# "Maskil" - 4:41# "Mishpatim" - 6:46# "Sansanah" - 6:56# "Shear-Jashub" - 2:06# "Mahshav" - 4:50# "Sheloshim" - 6:45# "Mochin" - 13:11# "Karaim" - 3:39*Recorded at Baby Monster Studios, New York City in August 1994, December 1995 and March 1996Personnel* John Zorn: Producer* Mark Feldman (2,4,6,10,12,14,16,20,21,25): violin* Erik Friedlander (2,4,6,10,12,14,16,21,25): cello* Greg Cohen (2,4,6,9,10,12,14,16,18,21,25): bass* Marc Ribot (9,18,24): guitar* Anthony Coleman (1,3,11,17,19): piano* David Krakauer (3,8): clarinets* John Medeski (5,7,8,13,15,17,20,22,23): organ, piano* Mark Dresser (1,15,19): bass* Kenny Wollesen (1,2,15,19,23): drums* Chris Speed (5,13,20,23): clarinet* Dave Douglas (23): trumpetSee alsoMasada (band)References
