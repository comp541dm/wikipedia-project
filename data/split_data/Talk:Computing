Portal pageDespite all the comments in Ugly Duckling above, this page remains little more than a portal achieving precisely the same as :Category:Computing.  Unfortunately I am no expert, so I cannot edit this page usefully.  I therefore, failing a sensible alternative,  re-propose the original suggestion that this page be replaced with a redirection to the category.

User talk:The Transhumanist|The Transhumanist;/i; 13:10, 10 March 2012 (UTC)RfC: What is the difference between information technology and computing?Currently it is impossible to tell the difference between these two subjects by reading their respective articles.This means that there is either something included that shouldn't be, or something missing that should be included.  Or both.What are these subjects about, and how do they differ?  User talk:The Transhumanist|The Transhumanist;/i; 15:35, 10 March 2012 (UTC):In general terms Info tech is a softer element, dealing with IT centers, applications, etc. and does no deal with the "hard topics" like algorithm design, processor design, etc. History2007 (talk) 22:06, 12 March 2012 (UTC)I advise against naive merging of Computing and ITThey are two distinct, yet interrelated subjects.  The distinguishing line may blur near the borders, but I would say its worth noting the distinction between 'data' as processed by computers and 'information' as processed and distributed by information technologies.  I think economics provides a great analogy: micro-economics is to computing as macro-economics is to IT, one cannot understand the latter without knowledge of the former, the latter functions on a macro (even global) scale while the former happens on a very small scale.One could make the abstract argument that a single computing machine is a kind of information technology, but again IT usually involves (as the IT articles states) intercommunication and distribution of information between users (being computing machines and/or eventually human users)Computing deals with the mechanisms of data processing, while IT deals with the usage and functions of the that data as information.I think keeping in mind the data/information and macro/micro distinctions should resolve this debate.Perhaps some explanation, like the above, about how computing differs from IT should be included on both or at least one of the pages.  However, I think that this distinction is reasonably discernible by critical reading of both articles.Anyone else care to weigh in?  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 1007198b (talk • Special:Contributions/1007198b|contribs) 22:06, 12 March 2012 (UTC);;; ;;:* '''Oppose merge''', as explained just above. History2007 (talk) 22:08, 12 March 2012 (UTC):* '''Oppose merge''', It's also a difference in point of view.  IT tends to be about how does an organisation (whether it's a commercial business, school, government agencym charity, ...) use technology to move information about and make decisions with it.  So it's all about information flow, Management Information Systems and so on.  Computing is how do I get a computer,  or network of computers to achieve a task.  That task may well have been decided upon from the IT perspective, but the Computing perspective is much more about the actual implementation of it. --Special:Contributions/86.186.68.172|86.186.68.172 (talk) 18:38, 16 March 2012 (UTC):* '''Oppose merge''', without looking at the articles, computing is a process while info tech is the resources applied to data. I'm going to look at the articles after posting this, but if a non-expert can spot a difference without being informed then it should be obvious. Cjripper (talk) 04:18, 26 March 2012 (UTC)::After reading both articles, it is obvious they both need development. However, there was not much evidence that they should be merged. Cjripper (talk) 04:39, 26 March 2012 (UTC):*'''For merge''', Much of the material is replicated across both articles. The same topic is treated in both articles. This glut of articles that have no meaningful difference merely serves to complicate the navigational process for users. --Denting5 (talk) 17:57, 14 April 2012 (UTC)*'''Strongest possible oppose''' to any merge proposal.
