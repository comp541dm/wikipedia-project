Corte-Real accompanied the German sailors Didrik Pining and Hans Pothorst, as well as (the possibly mythical) John Scolvus. He was the first European to claim the land of Canada.;;Carlosmoreira69 (talk) 01:40, 20 February 2016 (UTC):Looks like there is a possibility that he could have found North America, but no evidence that it was Canada or that it even happened.

Data is derived from both 2006 and 2011 reference. The "self-reported" ethnic categories and % used in this pie chart are NOT what are found in the cited reference. As recorded in the reference itself the categories and percentages derived are as follows: Aboriginal (5.5%), Other North American (33.7%), European (61.3%), Caribbean (1.9%), Latin American (1.7%), African (2.3%), Asian (15.2%) and Oceana (0.2%). 26% of surveyed individuals did not respond to the question. The absolute numbers and cumulative percents are greater then the population size and greater than 100%, because the self-reporting mechanism allows for the reporting of more than one ethnic identity. The section needs to be updated and the pie chart should be removed as it is not a viable reporting tool for this type of data. Baring objections I will remove the pie chart, and endeavour to update the section.  Robert Brukner (talk) 04:03, 25 February 2016 (UTC):I object here just because the info above does not match anything I can find ..for example  Aboriginals at 5.5%?....The source linked from the ref here says: ....this is what we say. Lets look at this closer ...then using ....Will work on some numbers....just odd we would be wrong on this all over for years. -- Moxy (talk) 03:52, 5 March 2016 (UTC)Maps of CanadaMost of the maps showing Canada are skewed.  The prairie provinces should be a straight line across, yet appear to be a curve.  Also it makes Ontario seem further south than it really is, and British Columbia further north than it really is.  It would at least be better if the curve was centered on the middle of the map (the middle of the country), but instead someone seems to have picked Southern Ontario as "point south" (which is clearly not the middle of the country).  It would be better if (all of) the maps used a Miller cylindrical projection, showing lines of latitude as straight horizontal lines.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/75.159.231.223|75.159.231.223 (talk) 07:54, 27 February 2016 (UTC);;; ;;maple syrupThe maple syrup is a famous syrup made by the canadians.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/92.74.22.16|92.74.22.16 (talk) 15:57, 27 February 2016 (UTC);;; ;;What Happened to the Coat of Arms?In almost every language other than English the article has the coat of arms next to the Flag at the topic of the page.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/2620:22:4000:50D:1FFA:C5BA:9FFD:A04E|2620:22:4000:50D:1FFA:C5BA:9FFD:A04E (talk) 08:00, 1 March 2016 (UTC);;; ;;:There is apparently no free and accurate image for us to use there.

If we must include the water area of Canada, then lets include all the water area of Canada. The Internal Water area is 2,500,000 km2 (fresh and salt) and the Territorial Sea area is 200,000 km2, for a total of approximately 2,700,000 km2   Any objections to making this change? Robert Brukner (talk) 05:50, 4 March 2016 (UTC):What's done with other countries' articles? From my quick lazy survey, I couldn't tell. The documentation for the infobox template doesn't give any description of what that field should contain.

Unless someone is going to argue that the Yukon Palaeontology Program,  Parks Canada, the Canadian Journal of Archaeology, The Canadian Encyclopedia, and a dozen archaeologists and paleobiologists such as Jacques Cine-Mars, Harrington, Burke and Morlanvariously from Quebec Archaeology, the Archaeological Survey of Canada and the Canadian Museum of Civilization,  are "not-mainstream", and can provide a serious explanation of why such prestigious Canadian institutions,  journals and archaeologists are considered  illegitimate sources, then this needs to go in the article.
