In linguistics, '''cognates''' are words that have a common etymological origin.The term derives from the Latin ''cognatus'' (blood relative).["cognate"], ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', 4th ed.: "Latin ''cognātus'': ''co-'', co- + ''gnātus'', born, past participle of ''nāscī'', to be born." Other definitions of the English word include "[r]elated by blood; having a common ancestor" and "[r]elated or analogous in nature, character, or function".In linguistic research it is generally understood as excluding doublets and loan words, although broader definitions are used in other areas such as language teaching.Characteristics of cognate wordsCognates do not need to have the same meaning, which may have changed as the languages developed separately. For example, consider English ''starve'' and Dutch ''sterven'' or German ''sterben'' ("to die"); these three words all derive from the same Proto-Germanic root, ''wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/sterbaną|*sterbaną'' ("die"). English ''dish'' and German ''Tisch'' ("table"), with their flat surfaces, both come from Latin ''discus'', but it would be a mistake to identify their later meanings as the same. ''Discus'' is from Greek ''δίσκος'' (from the verb ''δικεῖν'' "to throw"). A later and ''separate'' English reflex of ''discus'', probably through medieval Latin ''desca'', is ''desk'' (see OED s.v. ''desk'').Cognates also do not need to have obviously similar forms: e.g., English ''father'', French ''wikt:père#French|père'', and Armenian wikt:հայր|հայր (''hayr'') all descend directly from Proto-Indo-European ''*ph₂tḗr''.Across languagesExamples of cognates in Indo-European languages are the words ''night'' (English), ''nuit'' (French), ''Nacht'' (German), ''nacht'' (Dutch), ''nag'' (Afrikaans), ''nicht'' (Scots), ''natt'' (Swedish, Norwegian), ''nat'' (Danish), ''nátt'' (Faroese), ''nótt'' (Icelandic), ''noc'' (Czech, Slovak, Polish), ночь, ''noch'' (Russian), ноќ, ''noć'' (Macedonian), нощ, ''nosht'' (Bulgarian), ''ніч'', ''nich'' (Ukrainian), ''ноч'', ''noch''/''noč'' (Belarusian), ''noč'' (Slovene), ''noć'' (Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian), νύξ, ''nyx'' (Ancient Greek, ''νύχτα''/''nychta'' in Modern Greek), ''nox/nocte'' (Latin), ''nakt-'' (Sanskrit), ''natë'' (Albanian), ''noche'' (Spanish), ''nos'' (Welsh), ''nueche'' (Asturian), ''noite'' (Portuguese and Galician), ''notte'' (Italian), ''nit'' (Catalan), ''nuèch/nuèit'' (Occitan), ''noapte'' (Romanian), ''nakts'' (Latvian), ''naktis'' (Lithuanian) and ''Naach'' (Colognian), all meaning "night" and derived from the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) , "night".Another Indo-European example is ''star'' (English), ''str-'' (Sanskrit), ''tara'' (Hindustani), ''tora'' (Assamese), ''étoile'' (French), ''ἀστήρ (astēr)'' (Greek or ''ἀστέρι''/''ἄστρο'', ''asteri''/''astro'' in Modern Greek), ''astro/stella'' (Italian), ''aster'' (Latin) ''stea'' (Romanian and Venetian), ''stairno'' (Gothic), ''astl'' (Armenian), ''Stern'' (German), ''ster'' (Dutch and Afrikaans), ''Schtähn'' (Colognian), ''starn'' (Scots), ''stjerne'' (Norwegian and Danish), ''stjarna'' (Icelandic), ''stjärna'' (Swedish), ''stjørna'' (Faroese), ''setāre'' (Persian), ''stoorei'' (Pashto), ''seren'' (Welsh), ''steren'' (Cornish), ''estel'' (Catalan), ''estela'' (Occitan) ''estrella'' and ''astro'' Spanish, ''estrella'' Asturian and Leonese, ''estrela'' (Portuguese and Galician) and ''estêre'' or ''stêrk'' (Kurdish), from the PIE , "star".The Hebrew  ''shalom'', the Arabic  ''salām'', the Assyrian Neo-Aramaic ''shlama'' and the Amharic ''selam'' ("peace") are also cognates, derived from Proto-Semitic :wikt:Appendix:Proto-Semitic/šalām-|*šalām-.Cognates may often be less easily recognised than the above examples, and authorities sometimes differ in their interpretations of the evidence. The English word ''milk'' is clearly a cognate of German ''Milch'', Dutch ''melk'', Russian ''wikt:mолоко#Russian|молоко (moloko)'' and (Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian) ''mlijeko''.Cf. also Greek wikt:ἀμέλγω#Ancient Greek|ἀμέλγω ''amelgō'' "to milk". On the other hand, French ''lait'', Catalan ''llet'', Italian ''latte'', Romanian ''lapte'', and Spanish ''leche'' (all meaning "milk") are less obviously cognates of Ancient Greek '''' ''gálaktos'' (genitive singular of  ''gála'', "milk"), a relationship more evidently seen through the intermediate Latin ''lac'' "milk", as well as the English word ''lactic'' and other terms borrowed from Latin.At times, cognates may be semantic opposites. For instance, while the Hebrew word  ''chutzpah'' means "impudence," its Classical Arabic cognate  ''ḥaṣāfah'' means "sound judgment."English ''black'' and Polish ''wikt:biały|biały'', meaning white, are cognates with opposite meanings, both deriving from the PIE , meaning, "to burn or shine."Within the same languageCognate doublets can exist within the same language, with meanings that are slightly to totally different.  For example, English ''ward'' and ''guard'' (;PIE ''wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/wer-|*wer-'', "to perceive, watch out for") are cognates, as are ''shirt'' (garment on top) and ''skirt'' (garment on bottom) (;PIE ''wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/sker-|*sker-'', "to cut").  In some cases, such as "shirt" and "skirt", one of the cognate pairs has an ultimate source in another language related to English, while the other one is native, as happened with many loanwords from Old Norse borrowed during the Danelaw. Sometimes, both cognates come from other languages, often the same one but at different times. For example, the word ''chief'' (meaning the leader of any group) comes from the Middle French ''chef'' ("head"), and its modern pronunciation preserves the Middle French consonant sound; the word ''chef'' (the leader of the cooks) was borrowed from the same source centuries later, by which time the consonant had changed to a "sh"-sound in French.  Such word sets can also be called etymological twins, and of course they may come in groups of higher numbers, as with, for example, the words ''wain'' (native), ''waggon/wagon'' (Dutch) and ''vehicle'' (Latin) in English.A word may also enter another language, develop a new form or meaning there, and be re-borrowed into the original language; this is called a ''Rückwanderer'' (German for "one who wanders back"). For example, the Greek word ''κίνημα'' (''kinēma'', "movement") became French ''cinéma'' (cf. American English ''movie'') and then later returned to Greece as ''σινεμά'' (''sinema'', "the art of film", "movie theater"). Now in Greece ''κίνημα'' (''kinēma'', "movement") and ''σινεμά'' (''sinema'', "filmmaking, cinema") exist together as a doublet.In fact, ''σινεμά'' stands beside a Greek neologism based on the original form of the same root: ''κινηματογράφος'' (''kinimatoγráfos''), with the same two meanings as ''cinéma''/''σινεμά''. (The film or movie itself is the unrelated ''ταινία'' (''tainia'').An example of very different and non-obvious English-language doublets is ''grammar'' and ''glamour''.False cognatesFalse cognateFalse cognates are words that people commonly believe are related (have a common origin), but that linguistic examination reveals are unrelated. For example, on the basis of superficial similarities, the Latin verb ''habēre'' and German ''haben'', both meaning 'to have', appear to be cognates. However, because of the way words in the two languages evolved from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) roots, they cannot be cognate (see for example Grimm's law). German ''haben'', like English ''have'', comes from PIE ''wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/kh₂pyé-|*kh₂pyé-'' 'to grasp', and its real cognate in Latin is ''capere'', 'to seize, grasp, capture'. Latin ''habēre'', on the other hand, is from PIE ''*gʰabʰ'', 'to give, to receive', and hence cognate with English ''give'' and German ''geben''.''Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben''Likewise, English ''much'' and Spanish ''mucho'' look similar and have a similar meaning but are not cognates, as they evolved from different roots: ''much'' from Proto-Germanic ''wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/mikilaz|*mikilaz'' ; PIE ''wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/meg-|*meǵ-'' and ''mucho'' from Latin ''multum'' ; PIE ''wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/mel-|*mel-''.See also*Cognate object*Figura etymologica*Historical-comparative linguistics*List of words having different meanings in British and American EnglishReferencesExternal linkscognate*[SpanishCognates.org]
