African reference alphabetThe '''Africa Alphabet''' (also '''International African Alphabet''' or '''IAI alphabet''') was developed in 1928 under the lead of Diedrich Westermann. He developed it with a group of Africanists at the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures (later the IAI) in London. Its aim was to enable people to write all the African languages for practical and scientific purposes without diacritics. It is based on the International Phonetic Alphabet with a few differences, such as ''j'' and ''y'', which instead have the same (consonant) sound values as in English.This alphabet has influenced development of orthographies of many African languages (serving "as the basis for the transcription" of about 60, by one countSow, Alfa I., and Mohamed H.

P. 527.), but not all, and discussions of harmonization of systems of transcription that led to, among other things, adoption of the African reference alphabet.The African Alphabet was used, with the International Phonetic Alphabet, as a basis for the World Orthography.Characters{|class="wikitable Unicode"|-| '''uppercase''' || A || B || ƁThe capital Ɓ has the form of Ƃ in the original document, which is not the current standard form for capital for this letter in most languages but is still preferred in Dan language and Kpelle language in Liberia. || C || D ||  || E ||  || Ǝ || F || Ƒ || G ||  || H || X || I || J || K || L || M || N ||  || O ||  || P || R || S ||  || T || U || V ||  || W || Y || Z |||-| '''lowercase''' || a || b ||  || c || d ||  || e ||  || ǝ || f || ƒ || g ||  || h || x || i || j || k ||l || m || n ||  || o ||  || p || r || s ||  || t || u || v ||  || w || y || z |||}See also*African reference alphabet*Latin alphabets*Dinka alphabet*ISO 6438*Pan-Nigerian Alphabet*Standard Alphabet by LepsiusNotesReferences*Coulmas, Florian, ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Writing Systems'', 1996, Blackwell, Oxford*IIACL, [''Practical Orthography of African Languages''], Revised Edition, London: Oxford University Press, 1930*Sow, Alfa I., and Mohamed H.
