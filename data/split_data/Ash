'''Ash''' or '''ashes''' are the solid remains of fires. Specifically, it refers to all non-aqueous, non-gaseous residues that remains after something is burned. In analytical chemistry, in order to analyse the mineral and metal content of chemical samples,  ash is the non-gaseous, non-liquid residue after a complete 100% combustion.Ashes as the end product of incomplete combustion will be mostly mineral, but usually still contain an amount of combustible organic or other oxidizable residues. The most well-known type of ash is wood ash, as a product of wood combustion in campfires, fireplaces, etc. The darker the wood ashes, the higher the content of remaining charcoal will be due to incomplete combustion.Like soap, ash is also a disinfecting agent (alkaline). WHO recommended ash or sand as alternative to soap when soap is not available.Other specific types*Products of coal combustion** Bottom ash,** Fly ash, product of coal combustion* Cigar ash, the ash produced when a cigar is smoked* Incinerator bottom ash, a form of ash produced in incinerators* Potash, a common name for potassium carbonate* Soda ash, a common name for sodium carbonate* Vibhuti, ash used in Hindu rituals* Ashes or remains, dried bone fragments left from cremationSee also* Cinereous, consisting of ashes, ash-coloured or ash-likeReferences
