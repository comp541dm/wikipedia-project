I don't know what you mean by "the symbols are no longer symmetric", and I don't know what you mean by someone being "unaccustomed" to the ;ge; sign.  We have to express that idea somehow, and the only two reasonable ways are ";ge;" and ";=".  But I think the former is more readable for students of mathematics, while the latter is more readable for computer geeks.  I can't imagine the article being of any use at all to someone who doesn't know the basic symbols of elementary mathematics; if you think it might be useful for readers that elementary, perhaps the article could contain links to other basic articles explaining the comparison operators?

I won't remove any further ones I see.  I would hesitate to make that a standard practice for math pages here in general unless we do end up using something like TtH to do the conversions automatically so we won't have to edit all those font commands.  I do think agree that esthetic details can make a big difference in the readability of math formulas (I really wish there were an easy way to vertically center the internal ||s within the larger enclosing ||s in rule 3 above), but the limitations of HTML are pretty severe, so you can't have everything you might want, and what works on one machine might not work on others.  --LDCbar notationwhat's the difference between |x|\, and \|x\|\,?

It would be nice to mention this in relation to the absolute value. In a sense the article does so, but it doesn't seem too unified.

A norm is not an absolute value, it does not verify the multiplicative identity (except in some algebras).

You are correct, a norm in general does not satisfy the  multiplicativeness property of the real and complex absolute values.

This is analogous to the absolute value giving no results less than 0, whitch is the additive identity. Graphed, this would hyperbolic over [-x,x] and linear outside that.Anyone care to comment on the subject?He Who Is 00:07, 27 April 2006 (UTC):Here are my thoughts on your idea.  A formula which suggests itself:::MAV(x,y)=\exp \left | \log \left( \frac{x}{y}\right) \right |.:Note that I have denoted it as being a function of two variables.  If you want to define it as a function of one variable, as your notation suggests, then its definition is slightly problematic for irrational numbers and negative numbers.  However, I don't think this formula is really what you want.  You want a function like this:::f(x) =\begin{cases}x ; |x| ;1\\\frac{1}{x} ; |x|;1\end{cases}:and then you can define MAV(''x'',''y'') = f(''x''/''y'').  This seems to extend naturally to all complexes without difficulty:::f(z) =\begin{cases}z ; |z| ;1\\\frac{1}{\overline{z}} ; |z|;1\end{cases}:and I take the complex conjugate to make the number's argument stay the same, though you don't have to do that if you don't want to.  This is actually a bit reminiscent of the concept of radial ordering, which is used in quantizing fields on the worldsheet in string theory.  -User:Lethe/sig|lethe User talk:Lethe/sig|talk [ +] 00:40, 27 April 2006 (UTC)The only problem I have with making MAV a function of two variables is that it loses its analogy to ABS in that it is no longer graphable on a requalar two-dimensional carteisian plane. Because of this, while it can be said that -5, for instance has an ABS of 5, -5 doesn't have a Multiplicitive Absolute Value unless it is paired with another number. And as for problems concerning negatives and irrationals, as far as I can tell MAV(x) = MAV(-x), and if you could elaborate on the problems with irrationals, that would be helpful, as they're not apparent to me.He Who Is 01:57, 27 April 2006 (UTC):If you want a function of a single variable, see my second suggestion above.  The problem with your definition is, –1/2 = (–1)/2 = 1/(–2).  According to the first representation, –1 ; 2, so MAV(–1/2) = –2.  According to the second representation, 1 ; –2, so MAV(–1/2) = –1/2.  For positive rationals, each positive rational can be reduced to a fraction of the form ''p''/''q'', where ''p'' and ''q'' are relatively prime.  Irrational numbers generally can be written as fractions many different ways, and there's no way to choose one.  The best thing to do is forget about fractions, and just check whether the real number is bigger than 1 or less than 1, which gives you the definition I gave. -User:Lethe/sig|lethe User talk:Lethe/sig|talk [ +] 02:21, 27 April 2006 (UTC)I think you mean check it it's absolutely greater than one. Also, in your example, you were comparing two numbers within a fraction, but the need not be represented as a fraction at all. Also, you said that "Irrational numbers generally can be written as fractions many different ways, and there's no way to choose one." This is inherently untrue, as by definition an rational number is:\mathbb{Q} = \left\{\frac{a}{b}|\left\{ a,b\right\} \sub \mathbb{Z}\right\} and an irrational is it's complement on \mathbb{R}. Therefore, Irrationals ''cannot'' be represented as any fractions. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by He Who Is (talk • Special:Contributions/He Who Is|contribs) {}.;;;:I think you've finally understood my point, which is this: forget about fractions.  I'm slightly bothered however by the fact that now you're representing this point as your own, and trying to teach it to me.  It is not me who was comparing two numbers in a fraction, that was you.  I was the one telling you that you should not be doing that, because some numbers can be represented more than one way as a fraction.  In my definition, I compare a single number to the number 1.  No fractions in sight.  As for your suggestion that irrational numbers cannot be represented as fractions, let me show you a counterexample: π=π/1=3π/3 = –π/(–1). -User:Lethe/sig|lethe User talk:Lethe/sig|talk [ +] 19:50, 27 April 2006 (UTC)I apologize, as I must have misspoke. I meant that irrationals cannot be represented as fractions of integers. Also in what case was I comparing components of a fraction? If I was I hadn't meant to, unless you mean representing a reciprocal as 1/x, which is the only way ''I'' know of in which they can be represented. I fear this entire conversation may have just come from a few misunderstandings.He Who Is 20:06, 27 April 2006 (UTC):You defined MAV(''x'') as ''x''/''y'' if ''x'';''y'', in your first post in this thread (scroll up to see for yourself).  Here, you take a real number, and compare the numerator with the denominator.  For various reasons I mention, this is problematic.  One way to get around it is to view the MAV function as a function of two variables; then you're simply comparing the first variable to the second.  Another is to forget about fractions, and simply compare the real number to the number 1.  I suggested to you that the second method was the better way: forget about fractions.  You indicated that you didn't understand the difficulties with fractions, so I explained further.  A few posts later, you tried making the same point to me, which struck me as odd, since it was the same point I made to you in my first post to this thread.  Finally, your point about irrationals admitting no representations as fractions of integers is true, but is no longer a correction to anything I wrote. -User:Lethe/sig|lethe User talk:Lethe/sig|talk [ +] 20:14, 27 April 2006 (UTC)Oh... You're right. And I now see what you mean. Inherently, this is the same as your notation posted thereafter, but as irrationals cannot be represented as fractions of rationals, it presents a problem. I suppose I had forgotten how I represented it in my first post, and for that reason was confused by your subsequent replies.This aside, I was recently considering this and something strange struck me. Where x plus its additive inverse equals zero, the additive identity, and x times its multiplicitive inverse equals 1, the multiplicitive identity, a theoretical exponential inverse seems slightly more complicated. It follows that 1 would also be an "''exponential identity''", but for all complex numbers z, z^0 = 1. This implies an exponential inverse of 0 for all numbers. But this does not follow in that x ''minus'' -x = 2x, x ''divided by'' 1/x = x^2, but the 0th root of x does not equal x^^2, as would implied.which seems contridictory... He Who Is 20:32, 27 April 2006 (UTC):Yes, I see what you mean.  Well, let's look more closely: z^1=z for all z, so 1 is a '''right-identity''', meaning that when we put 1 on the right-hand side of the exponentiation, we get back what we started with.  Unfortunately, it is not also a '''left-identity''', since 1^z≠z, for all z.  I guess there is no left-identity.  When there are both a left-identity and a right-identity, then they have to be equal (at least when the operation is associative), which allows us a flexible definition of inverse.  We don't have that, and exponentiation is not associative (since 1^(2^3) = 1 ≠ 8 = (1^2)^3), so our inverse is also in trouble.  Nevertheless, we could try to imagine 0 as some sort of "exponential right-inverse".  It's not an "exponential left-inverse", since 0^z≠1 for all z.  But check this out, there are two inverse operations of exponentiation: extracting roots, and taking logarithms with a given base.  Under addition, we get 0–x = -x, and under multiplication we get 1÷x = x–1, and under exponentiation, we get logx 1 = 0 (which is the exponential inverse of x).  This doesn't work with root extraction: 11/x≠0.  Thus, what we really want, instead of taking roots, is taking logarithms.  Trying your equation again, I get logx 0, which is probably some infinity.  Alright, you're right.  It just doesn't work.:It's a phenomenon that I've thought about in the past: addition is a nice operation.  Iterate it, and you get multiplication, another nice operation.  Iterate again, and you get exponentiation, which is not so nice.  What happened in the second iteration that didn't happen in the first iteration?  I never came up with a satisfactory answer to this question. -User:Lethe/sig|lethe User talk:Lethe/sig|talk [ +] 21:19, 27 April 2006 (UTC)Yes. It's a strange phenomenon. Why does exponentiation lack the commutativity of addition and mutiplication? This subject is closely related to the hyper operator, which I've been doing some work with lately. Namely, to generalize for things like 2^{(1.5)}3,which essentially would ask to perform the operation halfway between addition and multiplication. Perhaps understanding this could give a better reason for the differences from exponentation on up. And another related question: where does commutativity disappear? Does it exist only for addition and multiplication, or for everything in between them also? If so, this would mean that the functions hyper(a,x,b) and hyper(b,x,a) coincide from 1 to 2, but seperate outside that which doesn't seem to make sense.And for the record, I believe logx0 is in fact negative infinity, which makes sense looking at an exponential graph, as it diverges from 0.He Who Is 21:59, 27 April 2006 (UTC):To try to understand this question, I turned to abstract algebra.  Starting with an abelian group operation (addition), by iterating you get something that, while similar to multiplication, is not precisely a multiplication.  That is to say, you get a left '''Z'''-module, mutliplication by "numbers" on the left by integers.  For general modules, the left ''R''-module is not isomorphic to the right ''R''-module.  Over abelian rings, they are isomorphic.  So viewed in this way, the commutativity of multiplication is actually a restatement of the commutativity of addition.  This framework provides a little bit of insight as to why iterated addition is still commutative, but it doesn't really support any definition of exponentiation.  Perhaps this is the reaon, though I don't find this explanation completely satisfying.:As for log''x'' 0, over the reals, that quantity is undefined.  Over the extended reals, negative infinity is indeed the natural definition for values of ''x'' greater than 1, while positive infinity is a natural definition for values of ''x'' between 1 and 0, while I'm not sure what to do with 0, 1, or negative numbers.  I thought perhaps some insight might be provided by the projective real line, where there is only an unsigned infinity.  In the end, I just gave up and left the vague phrase "some infinity". -User:Lethe/sig|lethe User talk:Lethe/sig|talk [ +] 22:49, 27 April 2006 (UTC)For negative numbers, the answers are simply complex. For 1, it in undefined even over complex numbers, because 1 does not change with exponentation, and as for zero, zx is zero for ''all'' complex numbers, so that could be anything.He Who Is 20:30, 28 April 2006 (UTC):The logarithm is single-valued on its Riemann surface, infinite-valued on the complex plane (because log –1 = iπ + 2iπ''n'' for any integer ''n''), and undefined on the reals.  There is, as far as I know, no way to add signed infinities to the complexes, so if you want log 0 to be negative infinity, you can't also want log –1 to be complex.  (Maybe you could add an infinity along every line through the origin in the complex plane, getting the extended complex numbers, homemomorphic to a closed disk?)  May I make a suggestion?  You should be more careful with the domains of your functions.  I think that's the third time in this thread that your disregard for the domains of your functions has led you to make statements which might get you into trouble. -User:Lethe/sig|lethe User talk:Lethe/sig|talk [ +] 21:26, 28 April 2006 (UTC)I apologize for that. I should be more careful. But either way I think a more formal definition for MAV(x) could be found (anologous to the sqrt(x2) for |x|) if another function for which the value at x and 1/x are equal could be found. Then that nested within its own inverse would equal to MAV(x). Do you know of any such function? He Who Is 00:17, 13 May 2006 (UTC)Absolute value a degenerate hyperbola?I have a question... Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't an absolute value graph just a hyperbola of a circle radius 0? Because ify^2 = \sqrt x^2Then this would lead to the conclusion thaty^2 - x^2 = 0Thereby being a hyperbola, albeit a degenerate one.Fisrt of all, you really should sign your messages. But either way, I see three problems in your above statement.  First of all, y^2 = \sqrt x^2 becomes y=\sqrt x, not y^2 - x^2 = 0. But even simpler that you seem to have misread the formula. Absolute value is graphes as y=\sqrt x^2 not y^2 = \sqrt x^2. Finally, y^2-x^2=0 is not a hyperbola, and a hyperbola does not have a radius. In fact if you were to simplfy that, it bould be equivalent to \pm y= \pm x, which would be a large x, made up of x=y, and -x=y.He Who Is 02:21, 18 May 2006 (UTC)I give my apologies for both not signing my post and also for making a syntactical error. I meant to say y=\sqrt x^2, the squaring of y was an error. This explains both the first and second fallacies in my logic; as for the third, isn't a geometric point considered a circle radius zero? If this is true, then absolute value would, I believe, be the hyperbola of said circle. --ThatOneGuy 07:19, 19 May 2006Ah. I'm sorry. I read hyperbola and thought parabola. As for your error, You ar in fact correct, come to think of it. The reason this doesn't show in the graph at first glance may lie in the difference between sqrt(x^2-r^2) and sqrt(r^2-x^2). One is your hyperbola, and the other is the circle of the same radius. If the absolute value is taken before extracting the squared root, you get both at once. In the case of the absolute value, the radius is zero, and the hyperbola's slope starts at \pm 1, it does not converge, and simple creates a right angle at the nonexistently small circle that normally seperates both parts. In the case of absolute value, the squared rootis taken to mean the principal root, so only the top half is shown, and because with a redius of zero, neither the circle nor the hyperbola are made up of complex points, they both show up. (even though since it is degenerate, as you said, the circle cannot be seen.) I've never thought about absolute value that way.He Who Is 00:55, 20 May 2006 (UTC)DefferentiabilityI think a section, or at least a mention, of differential and antiderivitive of |x| should be added. It's differentibility is mentioned, but not it's actual derivitive. (That is, \frac{d}{dx}|x| = sgn{x} = \frac{x}{|x|}. Also, \int |x| dx = x|x|. Which is x2 for all x greater than or equal to 0, and -x^2 otherwise.)He Who Is 22:08, 23 May 2006 (UTC):I think those would be good additions to the article.  The derivative of the absolute value might actually be a useful formula (mention the Heaviside step function), but I don't think I've ever seen the integral used.  Of course you have to make sure to mention that it's not differentiable at the origin. -User:Lethe/sig|lethe User talk:Lethe/sig|talk [ +] 00:20, 24 May 2006 (UTC)Added it.

It's mostly OK, but I also decided to get rid of the stuff about multiple integrals, which seems a bit weird to me (not to mention badly formed). -User:Lethe/sig|lethe User talk:Lethe/sig|talk [ +] 01:53, 24 May 2006 (UTC)DivisionI'm tempted to remove a certain statement, but decided to see what other wikipedians have to say about it first. It is the statement that claims preversation of division is equivalent to multiplicativeness. This is because of the following: (Remember that this assuming the person performing the calculations ''doesn't'' know about preversation of division in absolute value.):\frac{|a|}{|b|} = |a| \cdot \frac{1}{|b|}You see, preversation of division is a result of multiplicativeness as well as the fact that 1/|b| = |1/b|, which is not implied by multiplicativness. Otherwise you don't have the product of two absolute value, you have an absolute value times the reciprocal of another. -- He Who Is[ Talk ];22:30, 20 July 2006 (UTC): But |b||1/b| = |b \cdot 1/b| = |1| = 1 by multiplicativity too.

I would like to know if it makes more sense to define Absolute Value as "An integer's distance from zero". Yeah, it's basic, but absolute value isn't just disregarding the integer's sign, is it? --Chrishy Man 02:02, 29 September 2006 (UTC):First note that absolute value is defined for all real (and complex) numbers not just integers. Second the two definitions amount to the same thing, but I think the article's previous definition is better, since it doesn't involve a geometric interpretation of the real numbers. I've reverted to the original definition. Paul August User_talk:Paul August|;#9742; 21:15, 16 October 2006 (UTC)Hey guys, the definition ''"modulus of a real number is its numerical value without regard to its sign"'' is 1) childish; and 2) misleading. It is good for the first introductory mathematical lesson when you noramlly are too young to be aware of the vectors and complex numbers, but it does not address the whole basic and great idea of the modulus: "'''Modulus is a length of a (radius) vector'''". This is brief and universal. The widely known complex and real numbers are included as vectors on the complex plain and number line correspondingly. I agree that the professional math things I'm not aware of must be left out of the definition, but covering the complex numbers is important to give the essence of absolute value, which relies not in the sign, but is determined by the distance from the origin. It took me ages to understand why the absolute value of a plain number and of complex number and vector -- all have the name ''modulus'' and math notation ''|a|''. Therefore, I strive to reduce the confusion caused by the children definition. Not to speak that the module was introduced first for the complex numbers. --Javalenok (talk) 21:13, 10 November 2008 (UTC)Absolute value for ringsUser:AlainD made , which added that the definition given for the absolute value of a field in the "Fields" section, is also used for rings.

Paul August User_talk:Paul August|;#9742; 19:44, 8 February 2007 (UTC): Well, it took me a long time to choose between "ring" and "integral domain", and I am ready to review my decision. It is possible to define absolute values for general rings, but as |x|=0 =; x=0 and |xy|=|x|.|y|, they are simply no absolute values on rings with zero divisors. So the decision turn on to be a choice between no harm and no interest, sorry between generality and vacuity.: I have sources. But may I suggest a look at the intersting remark at the end of Absolute_value_(algebra)#Valuations before sorting contaradictory definitions.: What do you call non-Archimedean: to be not Archimedean or to be ultrametric?: AlainD 11:51, 9 February 2007 (UTC)Hi Alain, thanks for the reply.

Paul August User_talk:Paul August|;#9742; 22:58, 10 February 2007 (UTC).Redundancy in complex definitionMentioning these two definition seperatley seems redundant to me:where  ''x'' and ''y'' are real numbers, the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus''' of z is denoted |z|, and is defined as:|z| =  \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.;/blockquote;...[if]:\bar{z} = x - iyis the complex conjugate of z, then it is easily seen that:|z| = r\,:|z|=|\bar{z}|:|z| = \sqrt{z\bar{z}}.;/blockquote;|z| =  \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} is derived from :|z| = \sqrt{z\bar{z}}. by simply mulitiplying the conjugates out. The latter is simply the factored version. Why have both mentioned seperately as if they are two different definitions or something?  Brentt 05:49, 10 February 2007 (UTC):|z| =  \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} is the definition, |z| = \sqrt{z\bar{z}} is simply an identity which follows from that definition and the definition of conjugation. Paul August User_talk:Paul August|;#9742; 23:10, 10 February 2007 (UTC)Wrong example codeI removed the last three code samples for computing absolute value. They were wrong because while the highest bit is the sign bit, changing doesn't necessarily produce negated version of the number. For example, -2 is 0xfffffffe in two's complement and ANDing it with 0x7fffffff produces 0x7ffffffe which is 2147483646, the correct result being 0x00000002. C version can work, but only assuming the machine uses sign-magnitude representation of signed integers. x86 assembly version is fully irrelevant, as x86 always uses two's complement.

I don't see an advantage in referring to the sgn derivation for 0.::* If we extend to generalized functions, the derivative at zero is indeed the delta function, but that is not part of classical analysis.::* Finally, as a function of a complex variable, the derivative is ''nowhere'' defined; abs violates the Cauchy-Riemann equations.

What does it mean to say that "the derivative of the real absolute value function is hard to define"?  The real-function derivative is easy to define.  And what does "a concise rigorous definition of the complex derivative does not exist" mean?

I'd be happy to relent on this matter provided you can direct me to some notable 'neutral' demonstration of your argument.

Dmcq (talk) 17:30, 22 May 2012 (UTC)::::::So, Swalomir, if it is indeed about no original research, why the need to appeal to past consensus?  D. Lazard, I understand your argument, but would we not, as extension of the necessity of an underlying algorithm need, to toss out the entirety of the list of integrals of trigonometric functions since no source or algorithm is given?  This ties in well with Dmcq's point, which I assume is about secondary sources, because the linking to WP:WEIGHT is itself superfluous given the depth of the article, and Mathematica is as good a primary source as any other Mathematical text.  To argue that noone has yet observed this identity and, indeed, written it down, seems foolish to me.  I am sure you would just as quickly toss out such an equation as  \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = \prod_{k = 1}^\infty \cos\left(\frac{x}{2^k}\right), if I did not point out that it is simple transformation of identity 1.439.1 in the ''Table of Integrals, Series and Products''.  Just because Wolfram|Alpha can provide the result does not mean that it is not sourced.  I am sure that close relatives of those identities exist in either the ''Handbook of Mathematical Functions'' or the ''Table of Integrals, Series and Products'', if one cared to look.  I'm sure someone will argue that is on me to provide such sources via WP:SOFIXIT, but by that same reasoning, I should follow Swalomir's lead and just delete all the content of the aforementioned articles (after creating a talk section intitled "removal of blatant original research") since I am too lazy to look up source for the integrals myself and (I can only assume) too skeptical of their validity to leave the content alone because it adds to meaningful content of the article.  I am sure that someone will try to point me to WP:WAX in response to this argument, but that only deflects the thrust of the argument; all I ask is that we make a reasonable attempt to be even-handed with this content in light of it's verifiability, particularly given the glaring lack of precedence provided by the community regarding such source material.KlappCK (talk) 18:44, 23 May 2012 (UTC)::::Who said it's not about original research?

Paul August User_talk:Paul August|;#9742; 21:25, 23 May 2012 (UTC):::::::KlappCK, I'm not going to Wikilawyer with you about this.  This is the second time you've appealed to Graham's hierarchy, but the basic fact is that (in both cases) the burden is on you (the person adding contentious material) to convince others, not the other way around.  So if it seems that I've been short in my replies, this is part of the reason.  I have said that it has long been accepted that WP:NOR applies to calculations done with the aid of a computer algebra system.  I indicated the relevant part of that policy (WP:PSTS), and stated that Wolfram Alpha is a primary source, and so not allowed to support this kind of content.  That seems fairly straightforward, and I honestly can't see how anyone can in good faith read our WP:NOR policy and come away with any other impression, but obviously you would like this to be clarified.  In fact, the same policy contains WP:CALC which allows ''routine calculations''.  If the output of a sophisticated computer algorithm were considered acceptable, you would think that this would be a good place to point it out, but it doesn't.  Instead, the purpose of this section is to provide an ''exception'' to an overly zealous reading of the WP:NOR policy for this particular kind of computatation.  If you honestly misunderstand the policy to allow the kind of thing you're insistent upon adding, I encourage you to post to WP:NOR/N to get clarification on the issue.  There seems to be no lack of local consensus here, however, based not only in the WP:NOR policy but also WP:NPOV, so the removal should be allowed to stand.

User:Sławomir Biały|Sławomir Biały (User talk:Sławomir Biały|talk) 00:25, 24 May 2012 (UTC)::::::::Conceding that this is most likely a primary source, I can only find one passage on the page you mention regarding primary sources that seems relavent to me: ''Unless restricted by another policy, primary sources that have been reliably published may be used in Wikipedia, but only with care, because it is easy to misuse them. Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation. A primary source may only be used on Wikipedia to make straightforward, descriptive statements of facts that any educated person, with access to the source but without specialist knowledge, will be able to verify are supported by the source.''  I note a distinct lack of references to calculations done with the aid of a computer algebra system and I take issue with being accused of original research as well as being accused of wikilawyering without proper context.  Nevertheless, the consensus among editors of this page appears to be that ''the primary source is insufficient because it is '''ostensibly''' the work of a computer algebra system''.  Assuming I have that right (and please correct me if I do not), then I concede that the material should be removed until a relaible secondary source can be found.  As a matter of good faith, what I would like to see and still have not, is evidence of this often mentioned prior consensus regarding the exclusion of computer algebra systems.  If such a policy does indeed exist, given all the links the community has been able to provide to other wikipedia policies, it should not be much trouble to provide a link to that policy as well.KlappCK (talk) 15:05, 24 May 2012 (UTC)::::::::: It's remarkable to me that the WP:NOR policy can, in any way, be construed as allowing things to be sourced to the output of a computer algebra system.  This is the policy I would have you read, and, if it is still unclear to you, then you should ask at WP:NOR/N for clarification rather than here.  Editors have routinely applied this in the past to remove precisely the sort of thing that is under discussion.  There is no clear statement ''against'' including the output of computer algebra systems because editors generally know that this is not acceptable (WP:BEANS).

First, my previous post was about ''reliability'' of computer algebra results, not about WP:OR. I am sorry if it has been misunderstood. About reliability of WolframAlpha in this case, one may add that the question is about series expansions at the origin and the first answer of WolframAlpha is a (trivial) series expansion around 1 given with a silly big O approximation of the error. This is not serious.:::::::::: About WP:OR. IMO, this is not the computation by itself which is original research, but the choice of the question (here asking the series expansion of the absolute value in term of orthogonal polynomials), the fact of giving worth to the resulting identities and, over all, the decision of publishing them in Wikipedia when they have not been published elsewhere. D.Lazard (talk) 16:30, 24 May 2012 (UTC)Simpler antiderivative proofWhy such a convoluted proof? What's wrong with the plain standard one:* For x ; 0, |x|=x therefore \int |x| dx = \frac{x^2}{2} + C_1.* For x ; 0, |x|=-x therefore \int |x| dx = -\frac{x^2}{2}+C_2.* Joining the two expressions you get \sgn(x)\frac{x^2}{2} + C=\frac{x|x|}{2}+C (for  x\neq 0), as claimed. It should also be noted that the "constant" C here is only locally constant. FilipeS (talk) 11:22, 13 June 2012 (UTC): Your proof it not at all standard. It is not correct because is does not defines the antiderivative at zero, although it is perfectly defined (This is a theorem that every continuous function has an antiderivative, and the absolute value is continuous, even at zero). Moreover, the absolute value and its antiderivatives being all continuous, your assertion that the constant is only locally contstant is a mathematical nonsense. D.Lazard (talk) 11:43, 13 June 2012 (UTC)You are right about the absolute value having an antiderivative in intervals containing zero. Well spotted. Nevertheless, it's trivial to correct the proof as follows:* For x ; 0, |x|=x therefore \int |x| dx = \frac{x^2}{2} + C.* For x ; 0, |x|=-x therefore \int |x| dx = -\frac{x^2}{2}+C.* Combining the two expressions yields the function f(x)=\sgn(x)\frac{x^2}{2} + C=\frac{x|x|}{2}+C, which is differentiable at x=0 as well, with f'(0^+)=f'(0^-)=0=|0|, so \int |x| dx = \sgn(x)\frac{x^2}{2} + C=\frac{x|x|}{2}+C.Standard or not, this is simpler and clearer than what the article currently has. FilipeS (talk) 12:07, 13 June 2012 (UTC):We didn't need a proof in the first place and we certainly don't need a longer one. One line for things that are unnecessary is enough for me. Dmcq (talk) 12:23, 13 June 2012 (UTC): This is now unnecessary, but after a little more thought it occurs to me that actually this proof is easy to make rigorous: |''x''| is continuous, so by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus it has an antiderivative given by F(x) = \int_0^x |t|\, dt.  Now compute this integral depending on the sign of ''x'' to get the desired expression.  Finally, observe that all other antiderivatives differ from this one by a constant (again, because |''x''| is a continuous function).  The definite integral does the stitching-together naturally.  (This all said, I think the article is better without a proof.) --Joel B. Lewis (talk) 13:44, 13 June 2012 (UTC)In fact the present proof is also dubious at ''x'' = 0, since it involves division by |''x''| (or, equivalently, the derivative of |''x''| at 0).  Frankly I prefer FilipeS's version for this reason.  (Actually, though, maybe the best thing is to remove the proof altogether.)  --Joel B. Lewis (talk) 13:04, 13 June 2012 (UTC):There shouldn't be a proof at all.  This is not a textbook.

FilipeS (talk) 11:18, 14 June 2012 (UTC)Other expression for the antiderivativeWhen I added the expression for the antiderivative in terms of the signum function to the article, ‎D.Lazard removed it with the comment "Sgn function being discontinuous, this expression is misleading, suggesting wrongly that antiderivative is not continuous". His caution is however misguided, as the product between a discontinuous function and another function need not be discontinuous, and indeed is not discontinuous in this case. FilipeS (talk) 10:47, 16 June 2012 (UTC):Sure, the expression using the sign function that you have introduced is true. But trueness is not sufficient for deserving to appear in Wikipedia. You have not provided any reason for introducing this alternative expression. On the other hand there are, at least, three reasons to not introducing it::* Sign function does not appear before in the article. Its relationship with absolute value appears only in next section.:* Passing from one expression for the antiderivative to the other is absolutely obvious, using the next formula in the article.:* But the main reason for my revert is the following: It is not obvious for most reader that the antiderivative is continuous; even for you, if one consider some of your edits which have been reverted. It is not obvious either to recognize when the product of a discontinuous function by a continuous one is continuous. Thus the occurrence of a discontinuous function in the expression for the derivative may (and certainly will) give to many readers the wrong impression that the antiderivative is discontinuous. This has to be avoided in an Encyclopedia.: D.Lazard (talk) 12:50, 16 June 2012 (UTC)::Unrelated to this, I moved the "Relationship to other functions" before "derivative" and "antiderivative" sections on the theory that it's more fundamental.  I'm indifferent to the inclusion of the form FilipeS suggests. --Joel B. Lewis (talk) 14:44, 16 June 2012 (UTC)Proposed mergeI think Absolute value (algebra) should be merged into this article.

Isheden (talk) 11:58, 26 August 2012 (UTC): I do not see any problem here (but some users searching for problems). "Absolute value (algebra)" is a well-defined thing, a self-sufficient one (outside any quasi-physical "magnitude" context) and does not require such thing as a "main article".

Incnis Mrsi (talk) 13:05, 26 August 2012 (UTC)::I guess it's clear that absolute value is the logical target for a merge, since the term is the same in algebra and in arithmetic, and since this article already has a subsection Fields under Generalizations.

Thus a fully correct formulation would need a more complicated edit. D.Lazard (talk) 06:53, 5 December 2012 (UTC)::What do you mean? The derivative of course does not exist at x = 0, so the derivative function is not defined at x = 0. Not defined means a value has not been assigned to some point for the function (In this case, no value is assigned to x = 0 for f'). So, not defined and does not exist mean the same thing.User: Pratyush Sarkar|Pratyush Sarkar;/font; (User talk: Pratyush Sarkar|talk;/font;);/i; 15:23, 7 December 2012 (UTC):::“Undefined” suggests that the nonexistence of the value of the function is only a matter of definitional conventions, that someone could come and say, “I’ll define f'(0)=42”. This is wrong here, the fact that the absolute value function is not differentiable at 0 is a theorem, not a definition. To answer the original question, if one takes a function f\colon X\to\mathbb R and asks for its derivative, it is expected the derivative will be given for all points of the domain of the original function, which is X=\mathbb R here. Therefore it needs to be explicitly said that the derivative does not exist at 0. If it were simply omitted, it would look as if this case was overlooked and the information is missing, not that the derivative does not exist.—EmilJ. 16:00, 7 December 2012 (UTC):::: The following answer was in edit conflict with Emil's;:::: When you '''define''' a function, like x/|x|, you define it in some domain, and the function is not ''defined'' outside this domain. In the case of x/|x|, the value at 0 should be 0/0, which is not defined as a value. But, like for Heavyside function, you are allowed to chose any value that you want for the function x/|x| at 0 (In fact x/|x|=(H(x)+1)/2, and the arbitrary choice made for H is convenient for x/|x|, see Heavyside function). On the other hand, when you '''compute''' the derivative at a point, you have nothing to define, but you have to apply an existing definition, which, here, implies to compute a limit. It is a ''theorem'' that this limit does not exist for the derivative of the absolute value at zero. Thus you are not allowed to ''define'' a value for it. In other words, "undefined" means "no definition has been given" and does not suggest any theorem, while "the derivative does not exist" is a theorem that may be proven and does not suggest any definition.
