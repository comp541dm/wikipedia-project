The Wiki article on Netball explains that Netball was originally a variant of Basketball developed to be more suitable for women, and was sometimes known as Women's Basketball.  But what I didn't realise until I looked at the Basketball article is that Basketball was originally closer to Netball than it is now. The most important difference now is that in Netball there is no dribbling, and players have to pass the ball quickly to another player.  But it seems that this was originally true in Basketball as well.Special:Contributions/109.158.129.92|109.158.129.92 (talk) 23:04, 28 February 2013 (UTC)Edit request on 1 May 2013;;Please insert The Gun (basketball) to the "See Also" section.

The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.2. The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands.3. A player cannot run with the ball, the player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it allowance to be made for a man who catches the ball when running at good speed.4. The ball must be held in or between the hands, the arms or body must not be used for holding it.5. No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be allowed. The first infringement of this rule by any person shall count as a foul, the second shall disqualify him until the next goal is made, or if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the whole of the game, no substitute.6. A foul is striking the ball with the fist, violation of rules 3 and 4, and such as described in rule 5.7. If either side makes three consecutive fouls it shall count a goal for opponents.8. A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from grounds into the basket and stays there If the ball rests on the edge and the opponent moves the basket it shall count as a goal. If the ball rests on the edge and the opponent moves the basket it shall count as a goal.9. When the ball goes out of bounds it shall be thrown into the field, and played by the person first touching it. In case of a dispute the umpire shall throw it straight into the field. The thrower in is allowed five seconds, if he holds it longer it shall go to the opponent. If any side persists in delaying the game, the umpire shall call a foul on them.10. The umpire shall be the judge of the men, and shall note the fouls, and notify the referee when three consecutive fouls have been made.11. The referee shall be the judge of the ball and shall decide when the ball is in play, in bounds, and to which side it belongs, and shall keep the time. He shall decide when a goal has been made, and keep account of the goals with any other duties that are usually performed by a referee.12. The time shall be fifteen minute halves, with five minuets rest between.13. The making the most goals in that time shall be declared the winner. In case of a draw the game may, by agreement of the captains, be continued until another goal is made.Wolff, Alexander.

However, the entire article is written from a perspective dealing almost wholly with basketball in relation to the USA, from the assumed perspective of a U.S. reader. A particular clear example is the various headings for different levels of basketball, all focusing entirely on the sport in the U.S. The international basketball section, which should rightly solely focus on the sport played at the international level, mostly does so, but then wholly inappropriately has a few short paragraphs about basketball played outside the U.S. generally.In fact, the whole headline system of this article is largely inappropriate outside of a U.S. context, as categorisation of basketball playing does not universally reflect the U.S. model.

Although it and its agent have somewhat succeeded in "convincing" their players not to play in FIBA tournaments, many players still do.:With that being said, FIBA doesn't have total control of basketball elsewhere. For example, in Europe, where FIBA is supposed to be the strongest, it has some trouble convincing teams to play at the league it organizes and instead plays at a a different league. While FIBA's position looks like weaker than the relationship between the G-14 soccer clubs and UEFA, it's quite sorta like that.:FIBA still manages to force people to play by their rules on the tournament that it has a hand in organizing though, and no other basketball entity is challenging that authority.
