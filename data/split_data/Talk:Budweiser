Requests for commentThe article is not neutral, Historically "Budweiser" comes from the town of České Budějovice, the name "Budweiser" should not be used solely as disambiguation for the Anheuser–Busch brewed Beer! The title should be moved from Budweiser -; Budweiser (Anheuser–Busch) , the current title has a bias towards US American readers.Off flavors comment"...giving it more time to reabsorb and process green beer flavors, such as acetaldehyde and diacetyl, that Anheuser-Busch believes are off-flavors which detract from overall drinkability..."It is not debated that those chemicals are off flavors at all.  There are no styles where acetaldehyde (green apple) flavor is acceptable, and only a handful of beer styles where diacetyl is acceptable (always in very small amounts).  You could consult the Beer Judge Certification program style guide (www.bjcp.org) as a source for desired flavors in beer.I only say all this because I think the clause"anheuser-busch believes..." should be removed since it implies that only AB considers them flaws and they are otherwise not generally considered flaws.  Seems almost biased against AB.  You could completely remove that clause and still keep the entire meaning of the rest of the statement.

EdJohnston (talk) 16:07, 26 August 2014 (UTC)* There is a viable argument for which approach is more appropriate: a search for "Budweiser" landing the reader on a standard dab page, or on the article about the beer by Anheuser–Busch with a hat note to a dab page. However, I don't see restoring the trademark dispute article with links to other possible Budweiser targets as appropriate or viable. The argument that the page was a WP:CONCEPTDAB doesn't hold up, as a broad concept article would need to have topics in common, other than similarity of name, enough that an article could be written, such as Football, Supreme court, or Central Asia. The articles in question here do not share the same topic, two are breweries which simply have Budweiser in their name, one is a beer called Budweiser, one is the town Budweis, and one is a trademark dispute - there is no topic or concept in common, simply a loose connection with the name Budweis or Budweiser. Making the trademark dispute the primary topic is not a viable solution as that appears to be the least likely target for a reader putting in a search for Budweiser, and merely delays and confuses the reader who is searching for either the Anheuser–Busch beer (most likely), or for one of the other topics associated with the name (which may include the trademark dispute, but as page hits indicate, is the least likely target). On page hits Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch) with an average monthly hit of 30,000 is the most likely target, and that is more than the combined average of the other articles, which is less than 20,000 a month. All things considered, Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch) meets the WP:PRIMARYTOPIC criteria so a search for "Budweiser" should land the leader on that page, with hat notes pointing to the current dab page which would be renamed as Budweiser (disambiguation). That Wikipedia may be influencing the trademark dispute by making the American beer the primary target is worth considering, and makes one hesitate, however a counter argument could be that by not making what is clearly the primary target the primary topic, we are siding with the German breweries. I think we need to lay aside the politics, and simply follow our own guidelines and common sense - what are most readers looking for when they type in a search for "Budweiser": they are searching for the American beer.

Thoughts? --George Ho (talk) 09:20, 22 October 2014 (UTC):The move by Cúchullain was based on an assumption that most readers who type "Budweiser" are looking for an American beer. That assumption distorts some of the facts that we have. The European product gets about 20% of the amount of the monthly hits that the American product gets. Obviously the American gets more hits, because of the US market size compared to English-speaking part of the European market; but 20% is nowhere nearly insignificant proportion, and rather makes sense looking at the markets where the products are dominant. However, the crucial point that has seemingly been missed by the participants of the discussion, is that in the United Kingdom and in Ireland, the only product labeled as "Budweiser" is the European Budweiser Budvar, as it is the sole owner of the "Budweiser" trademark in the EU; and so in the UK and Ireland the American Anheuser-Busch product is '''not a Budweiser''' at all even by law (). Therefore having the American product under the Budweiser article is grossly misleading for readers from the United Kingdom and Ireland; and has a lesser "educational value" for other readers.:Besides that, Cúchullain made a decision based on the fact that the "majority of all participants favored a change over the status quo". But dividing the participants into 3 groups with 3 goals and calling the previous situation an undesirable status quo is artificially fragmenting the participants who want to stay brand-neutral and oppose having the American product labeled as just "Budweiser". The brand-neutral position was supported by 8 (+me now is 9) and opposed by 7; but still a move towards one brand was executed.:I believe we should remain neutral because the division of what "Budweiser" means is significant even within the English speaking world. I propose that Budweiser redirects to slightly reworked Budweiser (disambiguation) (with added explanation of the meaning of the German word), but at the same time I also support redirecting Budweiser to Budweiser trademark dispute, rather than giving the Budweiser name to one specific brand because that would represent neither the global situation, nor the situation in the English-speaking world but rather just North America.--Der Golem (talk) 03:04, 26 November 2014 (UTC)::I agree, a redirect to Budweiser (disambiguation) should be the best way.

The word ''Budweiser'' is not just a "name on a building" but a PAID choice. When this venue ''chooses'' to host events like having embattled comedian Bill Cosby perform at the venue, they are ''linking'' the idea of Budweiser + Cosby.

The link between Budweiser and Budweiser Gardens is tenuous at best: the venue is owned by Larimer County and managed by Global Spectrum. I can’t even find any evidence that Budweiser has anything to do with the running of the venue at all. It seems that all they do is pay a fee to have their name over the door. There is no evidence they have any control over which acts appear at the venue. There doesn’t seem to be any evidence that Budweiser even knew that Cosby would be appearing at the venue or that they could do anything to stop him appearing even if they did know. There’s certainly no evidence that Budweiser approved the act.  The connection between the venue and Budweiser is so tenuous that the venue isn’t even mentioned in this article. As far as I can tell all we have is that Budweiser paid to have their name put over the door of a venue, and a celebrity who has been accused of a crime appeared at that venue several years later? Is that an accurate summary of what can be establised with reliable soucres? Unless we can show that Budweiser was aware that Cosby was appearing at the venue and had some sort of control of the venue that might have enabled them to prevent that, then there is simply no connection between Budweiser and Cosby. At this stage there is no evidence that anybody working for  Budweiser even knows who Bill Cosby is. In summary, my opinion is that this material doesn’t belong here until we get some reliable sources to indicate that someone at Budweiser was aware that Cosby was appearing and approved that appearance. FWIW, I also do not work for Budweiser. I have never even drunk Budweiser. Having lived most of my life in a different hemisphere (both ways) I don’t think I have ever even seen a Budweiser. Mark Marathon (talk) 02:39, 16 January 2015 (UTC)|}::Thank you for your view. In terms of ''processes'', I agree that it is probably unlikely that marketing people at Anheuser-Busch had direct control over which performers perform in the venue with the 'Budweiser' label pasted prominently on their site, but if you look at it in terms of results, of course there is a strong association. . They control where the name 'Budweiser' appears. They pay to have their name on a prominent venue which ''serves alcohol'', presumably Budweiser, which is one of America's top brands of beer. Anheuser-Busch marketers have sought to ''link'' in customer's minds ideas the positive associations about performers, fun, and Budweiser beer. In this situation, one of the performers at the ''Budweiser Gardens'' is a prominent celebrity accused by [32 women] (latest count) of drugging and raping them. Like it or not, there IS an association now between a prominent beer brand and an alleged rapist. Not only that, the allegations are that Cosby ''used alcohol'' to disguise the drugging. Of course it is possible for Anheuser-Busch to withdraw their name from the site, or forbid the management of the place not to host rapists. It is not some sideline issue when a prominent American filmmaker, Judd Apatow, [criticizes Budweiser Gardens] for hosting Cosby.--Tomwsulcer (talk) 12:34, 16 January 2015 (UTC):::My opinion remains unchanged. When we have some evidence from a reliable source that Anheuser-Busch is informed in advance who plays at their venues, and that it is possible for Anheuser-Busch to withdraw their name from the site, and that it is possible for Anheuser-Busch to forbid the managers and owners of the site from hiring certain acts, then this material ''might'' be allowable. But at this stage we have no evidence that this is the case. Based on the reliable sources provided so far and those I have been able to find on my own, Anheuser-Busch does not have the ability to do any of those things. It would be rather extraordinary of they did have those powers. Finding a sponsor for a venue is a really big deal with long-term ramifications in terms of branding, and there are all sorts of legal contracts that prevent sponsors from pulling out. And without some evidence, it seems incredible that someone sponsoring a building would have any ability to forbid the owners from using that building for its intended purpose. The WP:BURDEN of proof is on those making claims that Anheuser-Busch have these abilities.
