Is this system still in use?Is this system still in use. To my knowledge nowadays international standards recommend people to use SI which is done in Europe.It's used primarily in physics E;M textbooks because the coulomb and tesla are rediculously large, and in SI they are different units. In CGS, the Gauss is the same as a statvolt/meter. I suppose that it is primarily an informational peice, mainly for completeness.--BlackGriffen:: Not quite true!  First of all, gauss is part of EMU, and statV/m is part of ESU, so they should not be mixed freely. Only in Gaussian and Heaviside-Lorentz variants, the '''B''' and '''E''' fields have the same units, — this is where this particular confusion could have come from (statV/m is a unit of electric field in ESU).Xenonice (talk) 17:50, 14 May 2009 (UTC)The equations for the force due to magnetic field and other magnetic equations are slightly different in CGS units than SI becuase it includes the speed of light rahter than a constant. CGS units are used in E;M textbooks becuase when using CGS units it is more obvious that magnetic forces are simply a consequence of relativity rather than a phenomena on their own.They were used not so long ago in physics papers (20-30 years) and they are still used by people which works with magnetic fields.Braice (talk) 11:37, 4 December 2008 (UTC):Math formatting does not seem to be working. Does anyone know why?::Wikipedia seems to convert simple math to greek font + subscripts.Xenonice (talk) 17:50, 14 May 2009 (UTC)It should be mentioned that chemists only recently converted from cgs to SI units. I suspect that it will be a long time before people who work in the lab use kilograms instead of grams.Even today the lack of mks units for such quantities as magnetic flux density and viscosity leads people to continue using the gauss and the centipoise. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by 71.250.142.249 (talk • Special:Contributions/71.250.142.249|contribs) {}.;;;:Grams are very much a part of SI.  Where'd you ever get the idea they are not?  There is no lack of SI units for the quantities you mentioned, either.  In fact, the SI unit corresponding to the gauss is the tesla, like the gauss with a special one-word name.  The SI unit of dynamic viscosity is the pascal second. Gene Nygaard 04:04, 30 March 2006 (UTC)::The SI unit for mass is the kilogram, not the gram, just as for length it is the meter instead of the centimeter.  Furthermore, while you are correct that the Tesla is the SI unit for magnetic flux density, mks/SI has no unit for the magnetic field strength H (equivalent to the cgs Oersted). -Athaler (talk) 20:35, 3 June 2008 (UTC):::This is quite sterile, one can also say that the gauss=oersted=statvolt/cm=statcoulomb/cm^2. It's like counting energy in petrol Barrels or TNT kilotons, It's the same thing but called differently according to the context. A system of unit, in my opinion, should not have to different names for the same thing. Braice (talk) 11:42, 4 December 2008 (UTC)::::Braice, the philosophy of dimensionally-equivalent units is described . You're right that gaussian-cgs does that. SI does it too, e.g. becquerel = hertz, Newton metre = Joule, etc. The idea is that people are less likely to get confused, although it does sometimes feel like an insult to one's intelligence. :-) --Steve (talk) 22:55, 23 December 2008 (UTC)So, much as I hate to throw anything new in here after a few months, I thought it was prudent to note that astronomers still use CGS units. I'm taking classes and trying to deal with the electromagnetic units are more of a headache than anything else, but every astronomy class that I've had has only grudgingly accepted MKS units instead of CGS. And sometimes its more of a headache trying to figure out how to modify equations written for CGS into MKS anyway. But yeah, astronomers haven't switched yet. Adrieth (talk) 07:55, 26 March 2009 (UTC)Definition of the centimetre''A centimeter is the capacitance between a 1-cm sphere in vacuum and infinity.''Is this true in the CGS system?  It doesn't make sense to someone raised on SI units.  Could this sentence be better worded to explain why a unit normally used for distance is also a unit of capacitance, please? -- HeronYes, it is true, although it is a 1 cm radius sphere I think. The concept of capacitance being used in this case is this: if you start out with this sphere and some charge Q at a distance of infinity from the sphere, then you force that charge to come from infinity to the sphere, little by little, then the energy required to do this is E, where E=0.5*Q^2/C. In other words, the energy required to compress a charge Q from infinitely spread-out down into a sphere of radius 1 cm.

Since capacitance is charge divided by voltage, the unit of capacitance is cm. :-) --Steve (talk) 19:33, 6 January 2012 (UTC): Capacitance in the esu and gaussian has the dimensions of length.  One finds a capacitance and then derives a matching length, and supposes that is what is meant.  A 1-cm sphere is in common parlence a sphere of 1 cm diameter.  The capacitance of a sphere is the same as its radius in these systems.  Note the HLU has a different capacitance, corresponding to a capacitance of opposite faces of a 1 cm cube. Wendy.krieger (talk) 10:28, 30 November 2014 (UTC)GaussWould anyone object to my removing the 'not used' from Gauss? I, and many others astronomers, use them every day.More GaussHe's far better known for his contributions to mathematics IMO he should be referred to as a mathematian rather than an astronomer (readers can read about his many other talents on the Gauss page).:Done. Markus Kuhn 13:17, 7 August 2005 (UTC)Various cgs systemsIn his recent edit summary, Crissov stated "clearer distinction between mechanical and electromechanic CGS is needed".Even allowing for the fact that edit summaries are often cryptic, that is not what is needed.  These aren't what need to be "distinguished".  The likely reason that the mechanical units are listed separately is not because they need to be distiguished, but rather that they are pretty much common to all the various cgs systems.  It is the electrical and magnetic units, and the electromagnetic system, the electromagnetic system, and the hybrid Gaussian system which need to be better distinguished (all sharing the same mechanical units).  Another distinction can be made between three-base-unit (with, for example, electrical charge measured in units of erg1/2·cm1/2) and four-base-unit systems using a franklin or a biot as a base unit, and between rationalized and non-rationalized systems. It hurts my head to even try to figure them all out; thank God for the International System of Units. Gene Nygaard 21:30, 24 September 2005 (UTC)::Well, it was a big pain, but it is mostly done.

The problem is, there are about a dozen conflicting definitions of CGS electro-magnetic systems, and a lot of people "mix and match" units from different definitions.

My reasoning:*Gaussian-cgs is much more common (in my experience) than the other cgs types. It would be nice to have a less-cluttered article focusing on just that unit system.*Tons of wikipedia electricity/magnetism articles discuss "cgs units" when they actually mean "cgs-Gaussian units". There's an ambiguity there, and it would be very nice to be able to fix that ambiguity by going through and (where appropriate) replacing links that point to cgs units with links that point to cgs-Gaussian units. That would be easier than changing the ''text'' of all those different articles to clarify "cgs-Gaussian". Especially when "cgs" is in those contexts a legitimate synonym for cgs-Gaussian.The article would list out the units and their conversions, Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz force law in Gaussian units, physical constants in Gaussian, something like the SI-Gaussian translation guide from the appendix of Jackson's E;M textbook, and where it's used in the world. Obviously it would link to this article as the place to learn about cgs in general, and also for more general notes on unit systems.Thoughts? :-) --Steve (talk) 23:11, 23 December 2008 (UTC): I think it is a great idea, Steve!  That way, we can keep the discussion of the reasoning behind and the differences between all the related cgs systems here, and refer to your new page for quick answers about unit conversion, where appropriate. I would call the new article "Gaussian System of Units", similar to International System of Units. Also take note of this compendium of less-known gaussian unit names from . Xenonice (talk) 20:52, 15 January 2009 (UTC)This article seems way too "pro-CGS"This article repeatedly praises CGS/Gaussian units for reducing pre-factors in Maxwell's Equations and giving \vec E and \vec B fields the same units.  So, those things may make the equations easier to read and write, but they generally make it an absolute NIGHTMARE to figure out what those equations actually mean, and to do unit analysis.For example, electrostatic units posit that the basic unit of charge is the statcoulomb, which is = √(g·cm3/s2).  Likewise the unit of resistance is s/cm and that of capacitance, cm.  These are quite unintuitive and disagree with the intuitive notion of electric charge as a unit distinct from other physical quantities like mass, time, and distance.  And a the article itself explains, there are multiple choices for the basic units, further complicating things.In my experience, only theoretical physicists prefer CGS units (and not all of them).  Experimentalists who have to compare values from equations to actual measurable quantities typically hate them with a passion, since they make it so hard to relate E;M and mechanical quantities in an intuitive, consistent way.  So I'd like to rewrite the article to reflect these issues.  Can anyone suggest a good approach, or any good sources?? Moxfyre (User talk:Moxfyre|ǝɹʎℲxoɯ | Special:Contributions/Moxfyre|contrib);16:54, 29 April 2009 (UTC)::I agree with most of what you said, but I think we cannot just dismiss the CGS out of hand. We need to establish clarity where it is most sorely needed. One thing that would be nice, is to have '''two more tables''' that compare the following aspects of the three systems (SI, ESU and EMU) or maybe even including Gaussian and Heaviside-Lorentz: '''(1) Dimensional analysis''' (e.g. Current is ''I'' in SI, ''L''1/2''M''3/2T-2 in ESU, etc.), and '''(2) Equations and laws of electromagnetism''' in each system, with the prefactors explicitly written.Xenonice (talk) 17:50, 14 May 2009 (UTC):When I read it, it seems neither pro-cgs nor anti-cgs throughout almost the whole article, except for the little "pro and contra" section at the end. That section definitely is bad right now...for one thing, it has no sources, for another it spends ~1 sentence pro-cgs and ~0 contra, rather than ~5 and ~5 which is what it should be. What are the other parts of the article that you see as "pro"?::Yeah, that's reasonable.  The intro and history mention that CGS is no longer used in most fields, but don't really explain why.  I guess I would point that out as well. Moxfyre (User talk:Moxfyre|ǝɹʎℲxoɯ | Special:Contributions/Moxfyre|contrib);22:58, 29 April 2009 (UTC):By the way, if you have a problem with measuring capacitance in cm, just imagine "cm" stands for "capacitance measurement" or something, with the conversion 1 capacitance measurement equals 1 centimeter! You're not the first one to have a problem with units taking on multiple physical meanings...Someone once had a problem with measuring radiation in Hz, so they made up a new name "becquerel" to be the unit of radiation, with the conversion 1 Bq = 1 Hz! :-) --Steve (talk) 18:55, 29 April 2009 (UTC)::True, the symbol "cm" could represent anything in principle.  The problem, in my mind, is not the definition of any one particular unit, but the relationships ''among'' them.  It seems that SI and CGS are based on two fundamentally distinct premises, which are outlined somewhat confusingly in this article.  I would describe them as follows:::* SI begins with the observation that electric charge (or current if you prefer) measures a physical quantity that is fundamentally distinct from any of the other base units of mass, length, or time.  Thus a new base unit of Coulombs (or Amperes) is posited.  This allows us to determine the units of ''all'' other EM quantities without any wiggle room.  For example, ''k'' in F_e=kq_1q_2/r^2 ''must'' have units of \mathrm{Force}\times\mathrm{Length}^2/\mathrm{Charge}^2.  Likewise k_A in Ampere's Law ''must'' have the units of \mathrm{Force}/\mathrm{Current}^2.  Any time an EM relation gives an answer with purely mechanical units, it can be directly related to a purely mechanical quantity.::* On the other hand, CGS begins with the notion that no new base units should be introduced to describe EM phenomena.  Perhaps this was historically justifiable, but today seems extremely justifiable.  Thus an equation like that of electrostatic force, F_e=kq_1q_2/r^2, is very ambiguous.  We do not know the units of either q or k.  One of infinite possible choices would be to say that k has units of Force, and thus q has units of Length.  This might yield an internally consistent system, but it invites apples-to-oranges comparisons with non-EM units.  In such a system, the electron could have a "charge" of, say, "1 meter".  There would not, however, be any physically plausible reason to compare the electron ''charge'' with any real measurable ''length'', despite their equivalent units.  We could equally choose to equate the units of Charge with those of Time, still without obtaining any physical insight that would allow us to compare ''charge'' with measurable periods of ''time''.  Furthermore, the ambiguity of this approach encourages the proliferation of multiple sub-systems of CGS, none of which is physically any more justifiable than any other, and yet all of which are incompatible.::And, that, in my mind, is why CGS is a nasty relic.  When I was learning EM in a CGS-based course, I would often try to work out the units of my answers to locate math mistakes and pin down the physical relationships between things.  Often I'd get the units of some seemingly mechanical quantity (length, time, speed, etc.) and try to relate it to the mechanical properties of the system.  And of course, this might be totally wrong, since in the Gaussian system, length and capacitance have the same units, so working out units of "cm" cannot help a confused student figure out what they're dealing with.::So I'm wondering if anyone knows of any reliable sources that explain these difficulties, hopefully better than I do, so that I can refer to them in the article. Moxfyre (User talk:Moxfyre|ǝɹʎℲxoɯ | Special:Contributions/Moxfyre|contrib);22:58, 29 April 2009 (UTC):::I added a few more references and explanations. Also, notice that the much-praised  SI system is 90% plain old EMU in disguise (that is factors of 10n from cm-;m and g-;kg conversions, and the fact that 1 A is defined with a somewhat artificial prefactor 10-7. The only substantial difference between SI and EMU is all the units related to '''H''' and '''D''' fields, where factors of 4π pop up in unexpected places.Xenonice (talk) 17:50, 14 May 2009 (UTC):::Quoting from above: "[In SI] Any time an EM relation gives an answer with purely mechanical units, it can be directly related to a purely mechanical quantity. [...] On the other hand, CGS begins with the notion that no new base units should be introduced to describe EM phenomena.  Perhaps this was historically justifiable, but today seems extremely justifiable.":::Light can hardly be called "purely mechanical", although the ''speed'' of light (which pops out of Maxwell's equations) can certainly be ''related'' to other mechanical phenomena. But more generally, relating EM and mechanical quantities is exactly what equations like Coulomb's law do. So the rationale behind CGS could be expressed by saying that if it is possible to describe EM phenomena without introducing any new dimensions then such new dimensions should be avoided because they generate spurious quantities like "the permittivity of free space" which one may be confused into thinking is a physical property of the vacuum but from the CGS viewpoint is more like an artefact of SI. Of course the same argument can be used to justify c = 1 too, going from CGS to natural units. It's a theorist's argument; the main factor it ignores is the desire to have sensible-sized numbers (i.e. of order 1) for everyday quantities.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/194.81.223.66|194.81.223.66 (talk) 16:29, 12 August 2009 (UTC);; ;;:Also, I think Bq/Hz may be the ''opposite'' problem.  The same physical quantity (average frequency with which some event occurs) is expressed with TWO DIFFERENT NAMES.  The frequency of a sample experiencing a decay could be reasonably compared with, say, the ticking of a pendulum.  On the other hand, a 10 cm long ruler cannot reasonably be compared with "10 cm of capacitance" in Gaussian units. :-) Moxfyre (User talk:Moxfyre|ǝɹʎℲxoɯ | Special:Contributions/Moxfyre|contrib);19:27, 30 April 2009 (UTC)::I added a quick explanation for why some purely electrical units become "cm" and "s/cm".

Remember, a lot of informed people think cgs leads to clearer thinking and better understanding...the article shouldn't come across as taking a stand one way or the other.:I think the biggest argument against cgs is that more and more people use SI, and whatever the advantages or disadvantages of one or the other, there's an obvious advantage to having everyone communicate using the same system. That's the argument I've seen the most in textbooks etc., so I think that one should be most emphasized in a "pro and contra" section. I can provide textbook references for this. --Steve (talk) 06:42, 30 April 2009 (UTC)::Thanks, Sbyrnes.  I'll definitely be careful to stay NPOV!

Therefore, E=B=H so E/H=1, not 4π.:A more important question question is whether E/H for a light wave is really the correct general definition for impedance of free space.

In fact, I have failed to find any reference in a selection of textbooks to "the impedance of free space" other than in SI units. Note that in SI, circuit impedance V/I and wave impedance E/H both have the same units as resistance, whereas in Gaussian units the former still does but the latter is dimensionless. So in Gaussian units it is at best confusing to call both quantities impedance. It would certainly be worth attempting to interpret 377 Ω in SI physically, as you suggest, and then asking what the corresponding physics is in Gaussian. --Special:Contributions/194.81.223.66|194.81.223.66 (talk) 09:43, 13 August 2009 (UTC)::Towards a physical interpretation. Transmission line impedance may also be written Z = √(L/C), where L and C are the inductance and capacitance per unit length. Like V/I, √(L/C) retains units of resistance even in Gaussian units. A cable "impedance-matched to the vacuum" with √(L/C) = Z0 in SI units would have √(L/C) = 4π/c in Gaussian units (or ESU). The 4π discrepancy with the given value for Z0 in ESU is due to the 4π in the conversion factor for H, but not for E, L or C. Likewise, the dimensionless Gaussian Z0 is because E is taken from ESU (as are L, C, V and I) whereas H is taken from EMU.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/194.81.223.66|194.81.223.66 (talk) 11:20, 13 August 2009 (UTC);; ;;:::This is interesting.

This is at best confusing.LeadSongDog User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl!;/font;;18:41, 11 August 2010 (UTC): The main reason they put c without units, is because the theory of dimensions as taught in schools is broken.  Quantities do not have dimensions = they have scales, and scales have dimensions.  When for example, you write 1 lb = 32.175 pdl, there is a dimensioned unity floating around being 1 = 32.175 ft/s².  If we multiply this by 1 lb, the unit becomes 32.175 lb. ft/s² = 32.175 pdl.   Likewise, in the gaussian system, there is a dimensioned unity that connects the esu and emu.  These individual systems have different units, but a conversion is possible between them by the relation '1 = 29.979245800 cm/s'.  So, for example, 1 emu = 1 Bi.s = 1 Bi.s * 3e10 cm/s = 3e10 Bi.cm, but the Bi,cm here is the Fr (ie the charge a biot delivers in the time light travels 1 cm).: The primary gaussian units in electrostatics and magnetistatics, all have units that have dimensions dyn^a cm^b.  The esu and emu that are not gaussian have a unit in the form with 's', where 1 s = 29979245800 cm.  So, eg charge is Fr = Bi.cm, to get Bi.s, then 1 s = c cm. Wendy.krieger (talk) 08:39, 1 December 2014 (UTC)Why the kilogram is more convenient for practical puposesA [thread in Physics Forums] discusses how this wikipedia article explains the replacement of the cgs- by the mks-system: ''"The values (by order of magnitude) of many cgs units turned out to be inconvenient for practical purposes. For example, many everyday length measurements yield hundreds or thousands of centimetres, such as those of human height and sizes of rooms and buildings" and "The units gram and centimetre remain useful .., especially for instructional physics and chemistry experiments, where they match the small scale of table-top setups". That does not make sense, does it? Lengths and masses are expressed identically in cgs and mks, when using the prefixes properly: 5 meters is 5 meters and 7 kilograms is 7 kilograms.''An alternative explanation is given elsewhere in the thread:''Cgs was replaced by mks because mks turned out to be the only system of units in which volt, ohm, and ampere are coherent with our units of length, mass, and time. The cgs, which was adopted by the 1881 International Electrical Congress (IEC), contained three electrical quantities with a prototype: voltage, resistance and current. The coherent cgs-units were abvolt, abohm and abampere. The prototypes were called volt (a specification using a chemical cell), ohm (a thin, long column of mercury), and ampere (current which deposits silver by electrolysis at a certain rate). The cgs-units abvolt and abohm were unpractically small, 1 abvolt = 10-8 volt and 1 abohm = 10-9 ohm. Because of the large difference between these electrical base units and their prototypes, the cgs was unsatisfactory. Giorgi discovered that the prototype units were coherent in another unit system, mksA. Ampere's Force Law, which relates current to force, got a new coefficient in the mksA system (2·10-7 instead of 2). The mksA system was adopted some time later by the IEC. Fortuitously, in the new unit system, the base units for mass and length coincided with the prototypes from 1799 (kilogram and meter). Just lucky, not on purpose.''In my opinion the alternative explanation is better. Ceinturion (talk) 16:56, 1 September 2011 (UTC): The cgs was chosen over the older MGS, because it has the density of water = 1, something that Maxwell specifically requested.  The electric units were defined in terms of MGS, specifically, decade units of the mgs emu that were nearest the siemens unit and the daniels cell.  Maxwell showed that these belong to a system based on the quadrant (10,000 km) and a unit of mass of 10 pg.  Gustav Mie constructed a similar system on the cgs, using the cm dekaton second.  But you can construct these sort of units on any fourth measure, such as the foot or inch.  Volts / inch is not unknown, and not an admixture of systems any more than V/cm were.: The Giorgi was based on the volt-ohm-second-metre, with a derived kilogram.  The formulation of the definition of the ampere as a base unit is because legal theory requires that you describe an experiment with values, rather than simply give a formula.  Since the legal standards are based on the pre-metric national units of length-mass-capacity (eg foot, pound, gallon), the base unit, once established, does not seem to change, even if the purpose is define something like "the speed of light is 299792458 metres per second".  The original intent was to define µ as in cgs-theory to 10^-7 H/m.

That sounds like CGS to me.`=Special:Contributions/98.67.108.12|98.67.108.12 (talk) 23:06, 31 August 2012 (UTC):Well, they ''are'' all in the table at Centimetre–gram–second_system_of_units#Electromagnetic_units_in_various_CGS_systems ... they are only listed by abbreviation (G, Mx, Oe), not the full names ... --Steve (talk) 01:18, 1 September 2012 (UTC):Units like the gauss and maxwell, belong to the "CGS practical" or Hansen system, the system that SI displaced.  This system consisted of the practical electrical units (volt - ohm - second), the unmodified CGS emu, and a generous helping of powers of 10's to convert between them.  The IEEE were coerced into approving the gauss etc in 1930.  Gauss gets a lot of currency, because it is about the size of the earth's mgnetic field.  reference = 'System of units in electromagnetism'  Leo Young, Oliver and Boyd, Edinborough, 1969.:The Franklin and Biot were approved in 1947 to permit supposed dimensional analysis of the cgs esu and cgs emu, in an attempt to prevent having to approve the ab- and stat- units.: When one detangles artificial constraints of the SI from CGS naming, it is possible to use most of the existing units to completely cover the gaussian units with simple names.  A franklin is a unit pole as well.  A gilbert is both V and U, an oersted is E and H, a gauss D and B, a maxwell the flux units of \Psi and \Phi,  A Biot is still I_a, but the esu does not have a unit around there.  You then have a millijar (jar = Lieden jar = 10 Dm capacitance), a millimic (a mic = microhenry = 10 Dm induction), and a milliper (a new unit, so that the permittivity and permeability are both 1 mper/cm.  A dimensioned interscalar of 376.730313462 ohms operates in the conversions.  Wendy.krieger (talk) 08:59, 1 December 2014 (UTC)Problems with the section "Relations between ESU and EMU units"In the sections "Electrostatic units (ESU)" and "Electromagnetic units (EMU)", we have the definitions: \mathrm{1\,Fr = 1\,statcoulomb = 1\,esu\; charge = 1\,cm\sqrt{dyne}=1\,g^{1/2} \cdot cm^{3/2} \cdot s^{-1}}and: \mathrm{1\,Bi\cdot s = 1\,abcoulomb = 1\,emu\, charge= 1\,s\cdot\sqrt{dyne}=1\,g^{1/2} \cdot cm^{1/2}}.It would seem that: \mathrm{\frac{1\,statcoulomb}{1\,abcoulomb}}=1\,\mathrm{cm}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\ne c^{-1},where c\equiv 29979245800\,\mathrm{cm}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\equiv C\,\mathrm{cm}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}. It is true by definition that: 1\,\mathrm{dyn}=\frac{(1\,\mathrm{statcoulomb})^2}{1\,\mathrm{cm}^2},and it can be readily checked that: C^2\,\mathrm{dyn}=c^2\,\frac{(1\,\mathrm{abcoulomb})^2}{1\,\mathrm{cm}^2}and: C^2\times10^{-11}\,\mathrm{N}=\frac1{4\pi\epsilon_0}\,\frac{(1\,\mathrm{coulomb})^2}{1\,\mathrm{m}^2}.A direct comparison of the three equations would argue that: \frac{\mathrm{coulomb}}{\sqrt{4\pi\epsilon_0}}=\frac{C}{10}\,\mathrm{statcoulomb}=\frac{c}{10}\,\mathrm{abcoulomb}.This also illustrates that \mathrm{coulomb}/\sqrt{4\pi\epsilon_0} should always be considered as an inseparable whole when dealing with unit transformations.Machina Lucis (talk) 03:07, 19 June 2013 (UTC):The arguments that you discuss are well-known.  Are you advocating that they be incorporated into this article or that an article should be written dedicated to Giorgi's work on the fourth base unit. Martinvl (talk) 06:21, 19 June 2013 (UTC)::It is unsurprising that this argument is well-known, but it would be useful to beginners to this SI/CGS mess, and I personally think my last equation is more palatable than the wishy-washy way of saying one coulomb "corresponds" to so-and-so many statcoulombs. The main point is that I am merely suggesting that the section I refer to seems to give the wrong ratio of statcoulomb to abcoulomb: it should be \mathrm{cm}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}, not c^{-1}\equiv(29979245800\,\mathrm{cm}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1})^{-1}. Furthermore, I agree with LeadSongDog above that in some parts of the article c\equiv 29979245800\,\mathrm{cm}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}, while in other parts c\equiv 29979245800. I was hoping someone more knowledgeable than I am can clear up this issue. Machina Lucis (talk) 16:38, 19 June 2013 (UTC):::This is one of the things on my "to-do" list, but it is quite far down the list. I also need to do a little reading first. If however someboidy has more time on their hands, feel free to extend the article (or possibly write a new article "Comparison of SI and GGS electrical units"). Martinvl (talk) 18:00, 19 June 2013 (UTC)::::I agree with (I would say) all the equations Machina Lucis has written.::::Above all I agree on the fact that it is crucial to state clearly that statC, statA, abC, and abA, being derived units, are indeed trivial products of powers of cm, g and s, involving no numeric factor.::::The main points, imho, to understand "correspondences" and "conversions" between different systems are the following two:::::* let's say: '''i[ESU]''' and '''i[EMU]''' "are the same current" (i.e. imply the same dynamic effect) in the ESU and EMU systems respectively (analogously for ESU-SI and EMU-SI, and/or other physical quantities); from the dynamic law (in this case Ampère) one has: '''i[EMU] = i[ESU] / c''', where c is the speed of light (a physical constant, dimensioned as a velocity, almost equal to 299792458 m/s or 29979245800 cm/s); this sets also the correct relationship between units of measures: '''statA = abA cm/s''';::::* then if '''i[EMU] = x abA''' and '''i[ESU] = y statA''', with x and y pure numbers (one could say the measurements, in EMU and ESU respectively, of the same current), then we have: '''x abA = y statA / c =  y abA cm/s /c = y/C abA''', being '''C = c / cm/s ≈ 29979245800''' (i.e. the measurement in cgs of the speed of light, the pure number that multiplied for cm/s gives the speed of light) so that the relation between the numbers that, when multiplied for their respective units of measurement, express the same current in the two systems (which is '''not''' a relation between units of measurement) is:  '''x = y / C''' or '''x / y = 1 / C'''.::::Sorry for my english, and for not using the equation editor (which I'm not acquainted with). Rocco.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/188.217.210.27|188.217.210.27 (talk) 20:44, 23 May 2014 (UTC);; ;;:: The proper way to think of units and dimensions is as 'algebraic blobs'.  This means that one can think of a unit like (foot) as (12 inch), and then move numbers into and out of the equation.::The relation here is that '1 (Bi.s) = C (Fr)'.  In any gaussian system, such as the fps or cgs, 'c' is the speed of light measured in the appropriate units, eg C(ft/s) or C(cm/s), and C adjusted accordingly (ie 983574900 or 29979245800).  One can suppose that there is a unit of time 'cm', representing the time that light takes to travel 1 cm.  Then, 1 Bi.s = C Fr = C Bi.cm, and hence 1 = C cm/s.:: But supposing that CGS must conform to SI dimensional analysis is simply plain wrong: charge and flux have the same dimensions, but different conversion factors between these, because the dimensional analysis does not take care of quantities SI sets to unity.  One of these constants is in gaussian and hlu, not just not unity, but has dimensions too.Wendy.krieger (talk) 10:45, 30 November 2014 (UTC)
