Special types of binary relationsThis section seems full of non-standard definitions, you might want to actually provide a solid reference for there first use, or who proposed them.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Differentiablef (talk • Special:Contributions/Differentiablef|contribs) 03:59, 30 July 2011 (UTC);;; ;;comment by Dbachmann'''reflexive''' is a very common word -- this should be reflexive (mathematics).

Reflexive now redirects to Reflexive relation. Are there any articles about other meanings of "reflexive"?  If so then we can turn Reflexive into a disambiguation page linking to each of the different articles.

I was 'blindly' linking to reflexive from Arabic grammar, and somebody removed my "wrong link" instead disambiguating reflexive.

"x=5" is repeated. But "generated" relations --being the graph of a given function f: x --; y, y=f(x)-- as "y = 2x + 1", x and y of the given pair (x,y), can not be repeated: {(5,11), [(5,11),] (2,5), (3,7)} because when "x=5" is repeated, "y=11" is repeated, too. Yielding, duplicated pair member in the set, and being discarded immediatly.The explanation is mine but the idea is coming from: Costas Bush, and//www.doc.eng.cmu.ac.th/course/cpe333/LectureNotes/chapter1_Introduction.pdf[Enrique Villar; mailto:evillarm@capgemini.es]:The article already covers functional relations. --Zundark 12:48 Mar 3, 2003 (UTC)Another definitionI have seen another definition of binary relation as an ordered triple R=(X,Y,G), where G is a subset of X ;times; Y and is called the graph of R.  This definition is better then the definition here as it avoid the confusion while talking about the function and its graph.  Any comment?  --Wshun:I have seen another definition of a graph - G(N, T), where N and T are set of nodes and connections/relations/associations/links/etc binding em correcpondingly. So, the notation G(R) used here for graph definition is merely unclear. Javalenok:So, in my opinion, the steps of constructing the graph G=(V,E) for a relation must be given. The set of vertices is the union N = (X v Y) which are connected by directed edges when xRy; that is, E={(x,y)|xRy}.In the current definition it says:"The statement (''x'',''y'') ∈ ''R'';/b;;/u; is read "''x'' '''is''' ''R'''''-related to''' ''y''"".Shouldn't it be like that:"The statement (''x'',''y'') ∈ ''G'';/b;;/u; is read "''x'' '''is''' ''R'''''-related to''' ''y''""?I mean (''x'',''y'') is an element of the Cartesian product X ;times; Y, R refers to the triple (X,Y,G) so "(''x'',''y'') ∈ ''R''" doesn't make sense. On the other hand "(''x'',''y'') ∈ ''G''" does, as that's what G defines: all the ordered pairs (''x'',''y'') of X ;times; Y such that x is ''R''-related to y, no?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by PhaseQ (talk • Special:Contributions/PhaseQ|contribs) 14:44, 16 January 2010 (UTC);;; ;;--PhaseQ 14:45, 16 January 2010 (UTC)error confusing ; and ;="A partial order which is trichotomous is called a total order or a linear order."This is wrong. A partial order is antisymmetric and hence cannot be trichotomous.To fix, either we also admit to call a relation ; a partial order when it is:asymmetric (which has to be defined yet as: not (a;b and b;a)) and transitive, and then referring to this definition for adding trichotomy.Or we simply change "trichotomous" to "total" in the above sentence.bo198214:Yes, the definition of "total order" given in the article was wrong.

There are two different definitions in the article, one under ''special relations'' (for all x in X there exists a y in Y such that xRy) and one under ''relations over a set'' (for all x and y in X it holds that xRy or yRx); the latter one I have seen before. If the former one is also used in the literature, then it should be clarified that there are different definitions. -- Jitse Niesen 14:57, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC):For the first meaning the term ''entire'' may be preferable. I used this term in the Axiom of dependent choice article, but I don't remember where I got it from. --Zundark 15:42, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)I now recall that ''total function'' is used in computer science for a function which is defined on all elements of its domain to distinguish it from a partial function (of course, it would be confusing to talk about ''entire functions'' in this context). But it does not matter which term is preferable, we should find out which term(s) is/are used in practice. -- Jitse Niesen 17:40, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)Definition of compositionWhat is the "correct" definition of ''composition''. Some hours ago, an anonymous changed it from:''S''o;''R'' = { (''x'', ''z'') | there exists ''y'' ;isin; ''Y'', such that (''x'', ''y'') ;isin; ''R'' and (''y'', ''z'') ;isin; ''S'' },to:''R''o;''S'' = { (''x'', ''z'') | there exists ''y'' ;isin; ''Y'', such that (''x'', ''y'') ;isin; ''R'' and (''y'', ''z'') ;isin; ''S'' }.Now, Paul August has changed it back. I seem to remember that it has also changed some time ago,The first definition has the advantage that it agrees with function composition (as Paul notes). However, I looked at some web pages found via Google (which is of course heavily slanted towards computer science), and it does seem that the second definition appears regularly. What should we do? Should we mention both? -- Jitse Niesen (talk) 21:35, 11 October 2005 (UTC):I'm afraid there's no "correct" definition. Conventions differ, though in my experience the second definition is more common. The fact that it conflicts with function composition is not necessarily a problem; also, it is sometimes resolved in other ways, either by changing the order of arguments in function composition, or by swapping domain and range in the representation of functions by relations (i.e., ''f'' : ''X'' ;rarr; ''Y'' is identified with {(''f''(''x''),''x''); ''x'' ;isin; ''X'' }). I guess any definition would work here, provided we use it consistently, and mention the other possibility as well. -- EJ 19:13, 12 October 2005 (UTC)We should mention both. But, since we define a function as a particular kind of a relation, I think we need to keep the present definition, which agrees with function composition, as the "primary" definition. Unfortunately this whole business is inherently confusing. Since both orders are used for functions and relations. However, in the case of functions at least, the order now used is fairly standard (see the discussion at function composition. The current standard defines ''f'' o ''g'', so as to preserve the "natural" order of ''f''(''x''), that is so that  (''f'' o ''g'')(''x'') = ''f''(''g''(''x'')). Being a category theorist, I would actually ''prefer'' the opposite "arrows order", whereby  ''f'' followed by ''g'', would "naturally" equal ''f'' o ''g''. But alas it wasn't meant to be. Paul August User_talk:Paul August|;#9742; 20:15, 12 October 2005 (UTC)I think, I believe, that there is an error in the example given of composition where it is defined.  I hesitate to fix it because I'm sure so many eyes have already passed over it that I find it hard to believe that they're all wrong and I'm right, but I will go ahead. As I read these comments it seems that the concensus is that f o g is "f after g" as is usual in most branches of math. Akurn (talk) 03:35, 11 June 2015 (UTC)Distinction between class and setJA: I humbly (but most sensibly) suggest that the class/set distinction, however important it may be in the long run, is definitely not 'line 1' material, since it can't be defined or discussed without getting into a controverted  variety of different axiomatizations for set theory, and that the (non-pejoratively speaking) 'naive' reader should probably be given a (however illusorily) 'solid' foundation in naive set theory before being led down that particular garden of forking paths.  Jon Awbrey 17:16, 18 January 2006 (UTC):I disagree:  the remark about membership and inclusion as examples of relations (not to mention general equality) requires some qualification if classes are excluded. Randall Holmes 17:40, 18 January 2006 (UTC):A concrete example:  if proper classes are not considered, the statements in the article on equality are wrong unless everything is restricted to a specific set. Randall Holmes 17:43, 18 January 2006 (UTC)* JA: I am not responsible for any of the content currently in this article, and only linked to it in connection with other topics.  No doubt it can be improved.  But the issues that you are raising at the "out-set", so to speak, do not need to be raised at that point, and will only serve to put a big cliff in the learning curve that will obstruct the general reader's ability to learn anything at all about the subject.  I am very much for rigor with vigor, all in good time, but I am not for that, just for starters, so I can only recommend some thoughtful reflection and discussion here.  Jon Awbrey 18:24, 18 January 2006 (UTC)::I moved the discussion of class/set to a subsection in binary relations (as requested by Stolfi) and omitted all reference to it in function (mathematics); I think a mention is needed in binary relations, but it doesn't need to be at the outset, and not even a mention is needed in the function article.  When you're right, you're right. Randall Holmes 18:28, 18 January 2006 (UTC)Which concept nests in which?If relations have frames (as described in the relation (mathematics) article), then a binary relation is a specific case of the more general concept of k-ary relation.  However, if a relation is identified with its graph, then k-ary relations are special cases of binary relations (in fact, a (k+1)-ary relation is a species of k-ary relation...)I am myself an unregenerate advocate of simplicity:  the relation is its graph.  Adding the frame to  the relation as a component is analogous to sticking type-labels to things:  objects should not have to carry type labels around with them, as the context in which they appear should provide cues sufficient to tell what type we are currently assigning to them.  This is not a proposal to change the article (the usage described is unfortunately common), just a philosophical comment... Randall Holmes 23:46, 20 January 2006 (UTC)* JA: I think that you may be confusing relations with tuples. That lingo that goes "so and so is a k-tuple ..." is just an idiom that means "the information that is required to specify a so and so comes in k pieces".  It may be confusing if one takes the "is" in too literal an ontological sense, rather than what is more properly understood as an informational sense.  Be that as it may, the specification still invokes only a tuple, and not a relation, and so there is no unfounded loopiness here.  And even if one forces a recursive definition on the matter, a singleton relation consisting of a single tuple is still a simpler sort of relation, and so the recursion goes to ground as it ought.  I don't get the thing about labels — the "frame" is just the requisite context made explicit.  And that's a good thing.  Jon Awbrey 05:36, 21 January 2006 (UTC)::No, I'm not confusing anything.  I am standing up for the old-fashioned view that a binary relation from ''A'' to ''B'' is best identified with its graph (a subset of the cartesian product of ''A'' and ''B'') and not complicated with indications of its domain and codomain.  If binary relations are defined in this way, then ternary relations (for example) are a kind of binary relation (I don't tout this as a virtue of the old approach -- it's merely an observation that things are different there).  If relations are encumbered with explicit indications of domain, then this ceases to be true (binary relation is then a special case of k-ary relation).  The domain and codomain labels are indications of type (indications of how the graph is intended to be used); my view (in general) is that the context in which an object is used rather than intrinsic features of the object should give type information (the context should not be part of the object, but just that -- its context).  Please note though that this is a philosophical grumble (because in my writing I keep having to nod to the (IMHO misguided) general practice), not a proposal that articles should be written differently.  Randall Holmes 00:36, 23 January 2006 (UTC)Renaming thingsFYI, in case anyone is reading this page and not Talk:Relation (mathematics), I have proposed that we consider moving Binary relation to Relation (mathematics) and moving what is currently in Relation (mathematics) to n-ary relation.  See the discussion at Talk:Relation (mathematics); in the interest of consolidating, let's have the discussion over there. Mangojuice 19:08, 25 January 2006 (UTC):Please don't. How would that help, at all? Binary relations are an important special case, but are certainly ''special''.

Certainly they are synonymous in the context of (partial) orders.  But consider the relation ''R'' on {''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d''} defined by ''R'' = {(''a'',''b''), (''b'',''c''), (''c'',''d''), (''a'',''c''), (''b'',''d''), (''d'',''a'')}.  While it makes sense to call ''R'' total, it seems to me squirrely to describe a structure that contains a directed cycle as ''linear''.—PaulTanenbaum 05:16, 8 November 2007 (UTC): There are two difficulties here, one about naming conventions and another technical.: First, the name of a mathematical entity does not necessarily imply all its properties, and a modifier doesn't necessarily create a subentity. A 'total order' is not an order that is total, it is a 'partial order' that is total (actual 'order' by itself is a bit fuzzy as a technical term (I don't think there is a community accepted definition though it seems closest to just 'is transitive')). Also, whatever technical meaning 'linear' has, it is only metaphorical in 'linear order', meaning it lays out in a line (more formally, there is exactly one way to lay it out on a line).: Second, technically, the realtion you gave is not a 'linear order' because of the last edge: (''d'', ''a''). That forms a cycle, true, and you cannot have a cycle in 'total-' or 'linear order', so you probably meant to have that edge be (''a'', ''d''). With that, the 'squirreliness' goes away.Hahahaha4 (talk) 20:58, 10 September 2008 (UTC)::No, the ordered pair (''d'', ''a'') was precisely my point. I can see some sense to characterizing the relation ''R'' above as total because for '''every''' pair of distinct elements ''x'' and ''y'' in the ground set, at least one of ''xRy'' and ''yRx'' holds. But the article asserts that for arbitrary binary relations on a set, the terms ''total'' and ''linear'' are synonyms. And I constructed ''R'' precisely to highlight the squirreliness of applying the label ''linear'' to a relation that contains a cycle. The problem does not arise for partial orders (where ''total'' and ''linear'' are indeed synonyms) because they are by definition transitive, and hence acyclic.::Would anyone out there care to confirm the synonymy of ''total'' and ''linear'' for arbitrary relations? If I don't eventually hear some such confirmation from somebody, the sheer squirreliness will eventually move me to deleting "(or '''linear''')."—PaulTanenbaum (talk) 00:31, 3 September 2009 (UTC)::: I've removed it per WP:V.

Here's why... if the usage(s?) is (are?) distinct from the mathematical usage, then it (they) should be in a separate article treated through Wiki-style disambiguation.  If, on the other hand, it (they?) is (are?) a special class of (isomorphic to?) the usage already described in this article, then the references to its use in linguistics and computer science should make this identity explicit.

I think its confusing because it gets people thinking that the binary relation can only relate two objects. (The only divisors of a prime are 1 and the prime itself)Talking about division, without the prime number, would make the point that while the comparison is only between two numbers, it can be true in multiple instances.I'm gonna change it in a week or so.Jafraldo Ramierez (talk) 15:44, 3 July 2008 (UTC):Readers who get confused by this must be careless readers. The article states immediately that for this example the prime 2 is associated with, among others, the integers -4, 0, 6, 10, but not 1 or 9; and the prime 3 with, among others, 0, 6, and 9. It is almost impossible to get from this the misconception that an element of one set can relate to only two elements of the other set. Also conversely, each prime is related to 0 and many primes are divisors of, for example, 2305567963945518424753102147331756070.:A reason not to replace the example by general integer divisibility is that in the present example the two sets, '''P''' and '''Z''', are different. If the two sets involved in a relation are the same in all examples in the lede, readers might be tempted to assume that each binary relation is an endorelation (homogeneous).--Lambiam 23:43, 6 July 2008 (UTC)Symbols for Binary RelationsI reverted the changes from the curly to the straight LaTeX symbols because the former are for general binary relations (of the given kind), the straight ones for particular binary relations. For example  a \preceq b  stands for -any- partial order, but  a \le b  stands for the particular 'less-than' relation for numbers.Also,  \approx   does not stand for an equivalence relation (approximation does not satisfy transitivity), and  \equiv  is a specific equivalence relation on integers. Hahahaha4 (talk) 19:21, 25 September 2008 (UTC):Sorry, but what you are saying is complete nonsense. In order theory and algebra (lattice theory), orders (and preorders) are always denoted \le by default, other symbols being employed only to avoid confusion when several distinct orders are considered at the same time, and even then it is more common to use indices like \le_1, \le_2 rather than odd symbols like \precsim. In fact, I can't remember ever seeing \precsim used for such purpose, unlike \preceq or \sqsubseteq. The reality is exactly opposite to what you claim, generic orders are usually denoted by \le, whereas \preceq is typically used for specific (pre)orders (e.g., elementary submodels in model theory). And yes, both \approx and \equiv are used to denote various equivalence relations, not just the two specific relations which you mention. —EmilJ. 14:13, 26 September 2008 (UTC)::It was my impression that more recent usage favors the curly symbols for abstract relations and straight for specific relations. But I could have narrow experience that is also skewed by LaTeX/CS culture. Hahahaha4 (talk) 20:16, 26 September 2008 (UTC):::I agree with EmilJ, and I and I don't think it's a question of publication dates. More likely a matter of different conventions in different fields.

Namely, given two relations (R on X) and (S on Y), we can consider functions f:X-;Y which are relation-preserving in the sense that xRx' implies f(x)Sf(x'). This yields a category whose objects are pairs (X,R) with X a set and R a relation on X; an arrow (X,R) -; (Y,S) is a relation-preserving function X-;Y.A special case of relation-preserving functions is when the relations are posets: then relation-preserving functions are the monotonic ones.Special:Contributions/145.97.197.129|145.97.197.129 (talk) 16:12, 7 August 2010 (UTC)Error in codomain/domain terminology?In the section there is a sentence that goes "Most authors insist on distinguishing between a function's codomain and its range."

Mikhalev, "Monoids, Acts and Categories" (ISBN 3-11-015248-7) that use these terms? – Tobias Bergemann (talk) 14:26, 15 January 2013 (UTC)::For what it's worth, there's a discussion at MathOverflow at where people wonder about these terms. Specifically the comment by Harald Hanche-Olsen (associate professor at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology): "I certainly did not know the terms left-unique and right-unique, and moreover when I tried to guess what they meant, I ended up with the opposite meanings. Left-unique, I reasoned, must mean that a pair in the relation is uniquely determined by its left member, i.e., functional. But that is the definition of right-unique. Go figure." –Tobias Bergemann (talk) 14:35, 15 January 2013 (UTC):::A web search suggests that various authors use these terms, it’s certainly not just one book. I think it does not do any harm to mention them, even though it is a minority usage.—EmilJ. 14:49, 15 January 2013 (UTC):::I also never saw those usages in mathematics, but there are lots of hits on Google Books for ''"left unique" relation''. The same issue with "left" and "right" not having clear meanings also happens in other places, e.g. group actions. ;mdash;Carl (CBM·talk);15:03, 15 January 2013 (UTC)After doing the search you suggested, it seems these four {left-,/right-}{unique/total} terms appear more common in a computer science context. For example, they also appear (with no change in left-right meaning) in:* ''Mathematical Foundations of Computational Engineering: A Handbook'' by Peter J. Pahl and Rudolf Damrath, p. 506* ''Semantics of Sequential and Parallel Programs'' by Eike Best, p. 19* ''Modelling of Concurrent Systems'' by Robert-Christoph Riemann, p. 21Since the book by Kilp et al., although written by mathematicians, also deals with automata (as acts), I suspect they were more aware of this terminology than other mathematicians. Why they preferred it is another matter, which I can't speak of. I have yet to find these terms in any book that was published before 1990,;/s; so I suspect they are of somewhat recent coinage, although I can't yet say who came with them. An earlier mention I found is in a 1991 IJCAI paper (and the associated 1990 technical report) "How to Prove Higher Order Theorems in First Order Logic" by Manfred Kerber. An even earlier mention appears in a 1985 paper/chapter ; this text does not even bother to define the terms, so I guess it assumed they were well-known to its intended audience (people dealing in algebraic specifications). Some1Redirects4You (talk) 03:57, 20 April 2015 (UTC)According to  it seems the terms were introduced by Bourbaki, but I have yet to confirm them. It seems plausible though given the group's propensity for definitional symmetries and lack of fear in coining new terms like magma (algebra). Some1Redirects4You (talk) 04:51, 20 April 2015 (UTC): Well, I can't find it the terminology as such in Bourbaki, so the authors of the pdf above might just mean that the notions are defined there (but not necessarily in that terminology). But I found at least "left total" defined in a pretty ancient 1967 book  ''Lattice Theory'' by Helmuth Gericke. I can only see snippets in Google though, and he doesn't seem to define the left/right unique but he does use the term  for bijective. Some1Redirects4You (talk) 05:19, 20 April 2015 (UTC)Error in the transitivity in relationsIt's written that "The transitive relation is irreflexive if and only if it's asymmetric" how is that? if I defined a relation xRy that holds if both X and Y are even numbers, so it is clear that it is transitive - if xRy is valid and yRz is valid then xRz is valid - and symmetric, if xRy is valid then yRx is valid too, however it is irreflexive in the same time, for example 3R3 is false! so it is Symmetric, Transitive and Irreflexive in the same time.Mo-Cubed (talk) 22:53, 22 October 2014 (UTC)MCubed:Your example is not irreflexive since that property must hold for all x and you have that 2R2 is true. Bill Cherowitzo  (talk) 03:45, 23 October 2014 (UTC):You are right in that your relation isn't reflexive, since not 3R3. But it isn't irreflexive, since 2R2. I added a note to the article about this issue. - Jochen Burghardt (talk) 04:18, 23 October 2014 (UTC)Section titled "Examples of common binary relations"It should probably be merged with (or at least turned into a subsection of) the section on [types of] endorelations. Arguably functions are very common examples of relations too... Some1Redirects4You (talk) 03:49, 20 April 2015 (UTC)Relations as "usually defined"In a random sample of about 40 textbooks from diverse areas of mathematics (algebra, analysis/calculus, discrete math, logic, set theory), all sources define ''relation'' simply as a set of ordered pairs, nothing less, nothing more.  A wise decision: this allows defining the composition of ''arbitrary'' relations.Only a directed search (internet, own book collection, book exhibitions at various math conferences) yielded a definition for a related concept based on triples (''A, B, G'') in two sources: Bourbaki, ''Thorie des Ensembles'' page 72, and , page 1331.  Invariably, the triples-based concept is called 'correspondence'.  One of its many disadvantages is that composition of the correspondences (''A, B, G'') and (''C, D, H'') is defined only for the restricted special case ''B = C''.The evident conclusion is that the current Wikipedia article represents things backwards, claiming that relations are "usually" defined as triples, "sometimes" called correspondences, whereas in reality relations are usually defined as sets of ordered pairs, and the triples variant (a different concept) is usually called a ''correspondence''.The absence of any evidence or reference for the false claim that a ''relation'' is "usually" defined as a triple should be a warning to all readers that something is askew in the Wikipedia article (Aside: Bourbaki is regularly misquoted by Wikipedia editors who did not get themselves a copy of the relevant book). Interested Wikipedians can obtain an annotated bibliography by sending me an email, Boute (talk) 11:20, 24 August 2015 (UTC):I tend to agree with you.  On the other hand, some characteristics of binary relations make sense only when dealing with them as triples; for example, totality.  — Arthur Rubin  (talk) 18:38, 24 August 2015 (UTC)::Careful use of existing terminology offers a simple way out: totality is the dual of onto-ness (for functions). Just as many authors (extensive bibliography on request) say that a function is ''onto Y'' (not just "onto"!) iff its range is ''Y'', a function or relation is ''total on X'' iff its domain is ''X'' (domain/range being defined as the set of first/second elements of the pairs). So the triples are not needed.  Moreover, it seems unwise to make a simple concept (set of pairs) more complicated (triple) just to accommodate a (lazy?) shorthand, at the cost of ruining generality, e.g., for composition and inverses. Anyway, I'd be interested in references defining ''relations'' (rather than ''correspondences'') as triples.::BTW, in my previous post, I forgot to mention that  translates Bourbaki into his own terminology.  Bourbaki simply defines a ''function'' as a ''functional graph'' (page 77 in ''Thorie des Ensembles''), where a ''graph'' is set of ordered pairs (nowadays called relation by most authors, whereas Bourbaki uses the term ''relation'' for an assertion with two variables - p. 16).  Bourbaki briefly experimented with the triple concept for functions (p. 76) but abandons it on the next page in favor of the more common ''functional graph'' definition of ''function''.  In his May 1957 article "Nicolas Bourbaki", Halmos pokes a little fun at the group for its temporary deviations from common terminology! Boute (talk) 03:12, 25 August 2015 (UTC)Confusing Sentence Order in definition of Transitive RelationThe definition of transitive offers a statement about transitive relations (connecting their irreflexiveness and asymmetry) and then gives an example of two relations, both of which are irreflexive and asymmetric, but one of which is transitive and the other of which is not. These two sentences should be reversed.Not sure if this is worthy of the talk page or if I should just make the change, but I've only ever done small edits.clahey (talk) 00:05, 6 October 2015 (UTC): Be bold, you should have done this yourself. If you make a mistake, someone is very likely to spot it and correct it, so don't let that hold you back. The trick is to not involve your ego with your edits − you do the best you can, knowing that you can't always be perfect. Bill Cherowitzo  (talk) 01:53, 6 October 2015 (UTC)Tag on section "Is a relation more than its graph?"There is a tag on the section "Is a relation more than its graph?" saying it is confusing and requires clarification. I just reverted a change where someone was saying a relation was always a correspondence as in the formal definition section before rather than the looser definition often use din logic. So it looks like the tag is needed an a bit more clarification is in order but I can't see how to phrase it better. Dmcq (talk) 21:18, 4 January 2016 (UTC)
