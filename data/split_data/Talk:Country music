02 March 2009Conway Twitty's importance in Country MusicBeing that (until George Strait broke his record in 2006) Conway Twitty had the most number-one-hits on the country charts and had crossover success as well, does it not seem reasonable that he should at least be mentioned in the history of country music? Just a thought. Special:Contributions/76.170.193.42|76.170.193.42 (talk) 18:59, 1 February 2013 (UTC)I agree. Twitty was also inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1999 with notable contributions . His presence in the history of country music is prominent.

Well its the Irish and other immigrants who brought over some of their folk music..Well although there were immigrants from Ireland pre revolution they would have kept quiet about it ..real Irish immigration took place in the 1840s and then relative to the size of the US was not enormously highSo from the 1620s right through to 1776 and on well until the 1880s and probably even later the dominant group in the USA were the British ..originated.However ,there is not one word of them or their songs and music ..indeed right through to the early 1900s it was British entertainment music hall stars that dominated American entertainment ..So where is this British contribution? From 1620 to 1776..150 years or 1620 to 1900..280 years there must have been some contribution.. but not a word!  Of course everyone knows that the music of the Star Spangled Banner..Americas national anthem is simply an old and popular London drinking song but there surely must have been many other British influences in early American music...Cant we read about them?Special:Contributions/80.98.113.13|80.98.113.13 (talk) 14:43, 4 May 2013 (UTC)::The above should be at bottom of this Talk page, not the top.

TBWarrior720 (talk) 13:36, 20 January 2014 (UTC)Review of the article19 November 2013 (UTC)I'd love to see a topic this major get to GA, but this seems to be a driveby nomination of an article that still has a ways to go to meet the criteria. The full criteria are at WP:GA?, but a few issues I see at a glance:*The lead doesn't appear to summarize all parts of the article per WP:LEAD, and contains important information not in the article (the rush hour stat).*Whole sections appear to lack inline citations, including some stats like "Webb Pierce was the top-charting country artist of the 1950s, with 13 of his singles spending 113 weeks at number one." and mildly interpretative material like "backlash as well as traditional artists such as Ray Price, Marty Robbins, and Johnny Horton began to shift the industry away from the rock n' roll influences of the mid-1950s" or "There is also a thriving country community in the province of Quebec."Thanks to everybody who's worked on this one to get to this point--I hope this can serve as a prod to bring this the rest of the way to GA, where it would be a sure winner of a Half Million Award at least!;/em; -- Khazar2 (talk) 16:54, 19 November 2013 (UTC);/blockquote;I wanted to post this here so other editors could see it without going elsewhere.

The subheader reads "Alt country." I added a brief paragraph about this genre to the article as artists like Uncle Tupelo, Wilco, and Ryan Adams had not been mentioned, and do play an important part in bridging the country genre with punk and indie rock. To many young people their sound ''is'' country. Beautiful article! Extremely informative!  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/216.113.113.161|216.113.113.161 (talk) 13:29, 17 March 2014 (UTC);; ;;Shouldn't alt country be under the '''Fourth generation'''? After all, artists like Jason and the Scorchers were around in the '80s, with little mainstream success to be sure, but they were there. And actually the roots of the music date back to the days of Kenny Rogers and the First Edition and Linda Ronstadt. I think it should be in the fourth generation, if not, I think there should at least be an explanation as to why it isn't. Like something to the effect of: "Although alt country was around since the '80s it didn't become popular until the 2000s." Just a thought.Noah Tall (talk) 18:28, 9 January 2015 (UTC)The whole "Generation" business started here - "Revision as of 20:41, 13 August 2012 (edit) (undo) 204.116.202.13 (talk). '''There was no discussion of the use of those headings''' among previous editors of the article. I would be fine if we ditched those "generation" headings altogether since they are a pretty artificial construct. Steve Pastor (talk) 21:07, 11 January 2015 (UTC)Sixth Generation - Miranda LambertCan we add Miranda Lambert to the sixth generation of country music? She has arguably had a much more successful career in the past decade than some of the other names that are currently listed in the section. Earlier this month she set a new record by winning the ACM Female Vocalist of the Year 5 years in a row overtaking Carrie Underwood's previous record. Just a thought! Glitteringrose68 (talk) 16:49, 18 April 2014 (UTC)Looks like you have at least one reference for it. I'd say yes. Please be sure to have them in the text. Steve Pastor (talk) 20:12, 19 April 2014 (UTC)Third generation (1950s–1960s)My personal memory of the 1950s is that Western and Country were very distinct genres.  To reduce it to absurd simplicity, Country music had banjo, Western music had slide guitar ;/or a jumbo western lead guitar (see Les Paul ; Mary Ford). IMHO, the article should better reflect the dichotomy that existed at that time. D A Patriarche, BSc (talk)  (talk) 07:04, 27 June 2014 (UTC)Criticism Section DeletedHere is what I deleted: "Country music has been subjected to criticism on the ground that each song has the same melody and the same theme. (specifically the unofficial "Bro-country" songs).[98] In 2013 rock singer Tom Petty called country music "bad rock with a fiddle".[99]" The first link was to a gawker op-ed- piece (seems like an Onion style satire) and the second is a Tom Petty interview. I wouldn't really say these are criticism's of "country music" as pertaining to this article since this article is covering the genre over a 100 year period. If there is a wiki page for so-called "bro-country" than maybe it would be appropriate there (but I doubt it). --Brian Earl Haines (talk) 06:30, 18 November 2014 (UTC):*Support the removal. Just because someone notable had an opinion doesn't mean it is relevant. And adding some neologism doesn't make it relevant. Even if this had been a serious article, I probably wouldn't support it because it's just a limited opinion that didn't get significant coverage. Were this an opinion that got widespread notice, it might be worth discussing. Niteshift36 (talk) 15:34, 18 November 2014 (UTC): I'm ok with it the removal, even though I agree with the opinion expressed. Everyone has an opinion, ya know?
