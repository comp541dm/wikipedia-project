Mistakes in the Annotated AliceI made an incorrect correction to the page the other day. Dodgson's date of death in the jacket of the new edition of Martin Gardner's 'The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition' is listed as July 14th, instead of January. You'd think a mistake like that wouldn't be in the definitive edition of anything. I also seemed to remember reading somewhere that Dodgson died when he was 66 and a half years old, which he would have been in July of 1898.GuildfordHe dies at his sisters' home, a house which he had bought for them with his royalties. It doesn't make sense to say that he lived in Ch:Ch: at then refer to his home in Guildford.Portraits of Lewis CarrollI'm thinking that a list of films or books or whatever in which Lewis Carroll is portrayed should be included in the article. I'm not an expert, and I don't know what films/books he has been in, but it would be of interest to people interested in Lewis Carroll to see others' interpretations of him in the media.I added in the Trivia section that Marilyn Manson was making a movie about him, because it is relatively important, and as trivia, it fits right in, but again, a proper section listing his appearances as a character in fictional or non-fictional works would be good.—The preceding unsigned comment was added by Donniedarkofan2006 (talk • Special:Contributions/Donniedarkofan2006|contribs).;;;Thanks to all!Thank you to all the people who have written about Lewis Carroll. I am saying thanks on behalf of my great great great (etc) Uncle. who in fact was Charles himself. So thank you all for contributing to his page. And if you don't believe me thats your choice. But guess what I am. Thanks again-BrianneReferences
