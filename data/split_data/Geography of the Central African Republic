550px|A United Nations map of the Central African RepublicLocation of the Central African RepublicThe Central African Republic is a landlocked nation within the interior of the African continent. It is bordered by the countries of Cameroon, Chad, Sudan, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo. Much of the country consists of flat, or rolling plateau savanna, about 0 above sea level. In the northeast are the Fertit Hills, and there are scattered hills in the southwestern part of the country. To the northwest are the Karre Mountains (also known as Yade Massif), a granite plateau with an altitude of 0.At 0, the Central African Republic is the world's 45th-largest country (after Somalia). It is comparable in size to Ukraine or slightly smaller than the state of Texas.Much of the southern border is formed by tributaries of the Congo River, with the Mbomou River in the east merging with the Uele River to form the Ubangi River. In the west, the Sangha River flows through part of the country. The eastern border lies along the edge of the Congo-Nile watershed.Estimates of the amount of the country covered by forest ranges up to 8%, with the densest parts in the south. The forest is highly diverse, and includes commercially important species of Ayous, Sapelli and Sipo. The deforestation rate is 0.4% per annum, and lumber poaching is commonplace.ClimateThe climate of the C.A.R. is generally tropical. The northern areas are subject to harmattan winds, which are hot, dry, and carry dust. The northern regions have been subject to desertification, and the northeast is desert. The remainder of the country is prone to flooding from nearby rivers. About 1/3 of the Central African Republic’s population do not have access to clean water.NotesFile:Central African Republic map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Central African Republic map of Köppen climate classification.A satellite map of the Central African Republic.Topography of Central African Republic.'''Location:'''Central Africa, north of Democratic Republic of the Congo'''Area - comparative:'''*Canada: slightly smaller than Manitoba*US: slightly smaller than Texas'''Land boundaries:'''''total:''5,920km''border countries:''Cameroon 901km, Chad 1,556km, Democratic Republic of the Congo 1,747km, Republic of the Congo 487km, Sudan 174km and South Sudan 1,055km'''Coastline:'''0km (landlocked)'''Maritime claims:'''none (landlocked)'''Terrain:'''vast, flat to rolling, monotonous plateau; scattered hills in northeast and southwest'''Elevation extremes:'''''lowest point:''Oubangui River 335 m''highest point:''Mont Ngaoui 1,420 m'''Natural resources:'''diamonds, uranium, timber, gold, petroleum, hydropower'''Land use:'''''arable land:''2.89%''permanent crops:''0.13%''other:''96.98% (2012 est.)'''Irrigated land:'''1.35km² (2003)'''Total renewable water resources:'''144.4km3 (2011)'''Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):'''''total:''0.07 km3/yr (83%/17%/1%)''per capita:''17.42 m3/yr (2005)'''Natural hazards:'''hot, dry, dusty harmattan winds affect northern areas; floods are common'''Environment - current issues:'''tap water is not potable; poaching has diminished its reputation as one of the last great wildlife refuges; desertification'''Environment - international agreements:'''''party to:''Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands''signed, but not ratified:''Law of the Sea'''Geography - note:'''landlocked; almost the precise center of AfricaExtreme pointsThis is a list of the extreme points of the Central African Republic, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.*Northernmost point - unnamed location in the Aoukalé river on the border with Chad, Vakaga province*Easternmost point - unnamed location immediately east of the tripoint with Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and south of the town of Ezo in Sudan, Haut-Mbomou province*Southernmost point - the tripoint with Cameroon and the Republic of Congo, Sangha province*Westernmost point - unnamed location on the border with Cameroon west of the town of Koundé in Central African Republic near Cameroon's Lokoti to Garoua Boulai road, Nana Mambéré provinceReferencesClimate ofCentral African Republicpt:República Centro-Africana#Geografia
