''Box Office Mojo''. Accessed December 30, 2006. The film also won four BAFTAs and two Golden Globe Awards, one for Best Foreign Film. Along with its awards success, ''Crouching Tiger'' continues to be hailed as one of the greatest and most influential foreign language films in the United States, especially coming out of Taiwan. It has been praised for its martial arts sequences, story, direction, musical score, and cinematography.PlotThe film is set in the Qing Dynasty during the 43rd year (1779) of the reign of the Qianlong Emperor. Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-fat) is an accomplished Wudang swordsman. Long ago, his master was murdered by Jade Fox (Cheng Pei-pei), a woman who sought to learn Wudang skills. Mu Bai is also a good friend of Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), a female warrior. Mu Bai and Shu Lien have developed feelings for each other, but they have never acknowledged or acted on them due to Yu's arranged marriage with Meng Sizhao (Donnie Yen). Mu Bai, intending to give up his warrior life, asks Shu Lien to transport his sword, also referred to as the ''Green Destiny'', to the city of Beijing, as a gift for their friend Sir Te (Sihung Lung). At Sir Te's estate, Shu Lien meets Jen (Zhang Ziyi), the daughter of Governor Yu (Li Fazeng), a visiting Manchu aristocrat. Jen, destined for an arranged marriage and yearning for adventure, seems envious of Shu Lien's warrior lifestyle.One evening, a masked thief sneaks into Sir Te's estate and steals the sword. Mu Bai and Shu Lien trace the theft to Governor Yu's compound and learn that Jade Fox has been posing as Jen's governess for many years. Mu Bai makes the acquaintance of Inspector Tsai (Wang Deming), a police investigator from the provinces, and his daughter May (Li Li), who have come to Peking in pursuit of Fox. Fox challenges the pair and Sir Te's servant Master Bo (Gao Xi'an) to a showdown that night. Following a protracted battle, the group is on the verge of defeat when Mu Bai arrives and outmaneuvers Fox. Before Mu Bai can kill Fox, the masked thief reappears and partners with Fox to fight. Fox resumes the fight and kills Tsai before fleeing with the thief (who is revealed to be Fox's protégé, Jen). After seeing Jen fight Mu Bai, Fox realizes Jen had been secretly studying the Wudang manual and has surpassed her in combative skills.At night, a desert bandit named Lo (Chang Chen) breaks into Jen's bedroom and asks her to leave with him. A flashback reveals that in the past, when Governor Yu and his family were traveling in the western deserts, Lo and his bandits had raided Jen's caravan and Lo had stolen her comb. She chased after him, following him to his desert cave seemingly in a quest to get her comb back. However, the pair soon fell passionately in love. Lo eventually convinced Jen to return to her family, though not before telling her a legend of a man who jumped off a cliff to make his wishes come true. Because the man's heart was pure, he did not die. Lo came to Peking to persuade Jen not to go through with her arranged marriage.  However, Jen refuses to leave with him. Later, Lo interrupts Jen's wedding procession, begging her to come away with him. Nearby, Shu Lien and Mu Bai convince Lo to wait for Jen at Mount Wudang, where he will be safe from Jen's family, who are furious with him. Jen runs away from her husband on the wedding night before the marriage could be consummated. Disguised in male clothing, she is accosted at an inn by a large group of warriors; armed with the ''Green Destiny'' and her own superior combat skills, she emerges victorious.Jen visits Shu Lien, who tells her that Lo is waiting for her at Mount Wudang. After an angry dispute, the two women engage in a duel.  Although Shu Lien is the superior fighter, Jen, wielding the ''Green Destiny'', destroys each weapon that Shu Lien wields, until Jen loses to a broken sword held at her neck.  When Shu Lien shows mercy and lowers the sword, Jen injures Shu Lien's arm.  Mu Bai arrives and pursues Jen into a bamboo forest. Following a duel where Mu Bai regains possession of the ''Green Destiny'', he decides to throw the sword over a waterfall. In pursuit, Jen dives into an adjoining river to retrieve the sword and is then rescued by Fox. Fox puts Jen into a drugged sleep and places her in a cavern; Mu Bai and Shu Lien discover her there. Fox suddenly reappears and attacks the others with poisoned darts. Mu Bai blocks the needles with his sword and avenges his master's death by mortally wounding Fox, only to realize that one of the darts hit him in the neck. Fox dies, confessing that her goal had been to kill Jen because she was furious that Jen had hid the secrets of Wudang's far superior fighting techniques from her.As Jen exits to gather up an antidote for the poisoned dart, Mu Bai prepares to die. With his last breaths, he finally confesses his romantic affections for Shu Lien. He dies in her arms as Jen returns, too late to save him. The ''Green Destiny'' is returned to Sir Te. Jen later goes to Mount Wudang and spends one last night with Lo. The next morning, Lo finds Jen standing on a balcony overlooking the edge of the mountain. In an echo of the legend that they spoke about in the desert, she asks him to make a wish. He complies and wishes for them to be together again; back in the desert. Jen then suddenly leaps over the side of the mountain.CastActor Chow Yun-Fat who portrayed Li Mu Bai2* Chow Yun-fat as Li Mu Bai (C: 李慕白, P: ''Lǐ Mùbái'')* Michelle Yeoh as Yu Shu Lien (T: 俞秀蓮, S: 俞秀莲, P: ''Yú Xiùlián'')* Zhang Ziyi as Jen Yu (English subtitled version) / Yu Jiaolong (English dubbed version) (T: 玉嬌龍, S: 玉娇龙, P: ''Yù Jiāolóng'')* Chang Chen as Lo "Dark Cloud" (English subtitled version) / Luo Xiaohu (English dubbed version) (T: 羅小虎, S: 罗小虎, P: ''Luó Xiǎohǔ'')* Cheng Pei-pei as Jade Fox (C: 碧眼狐狸, P: ''Bìyǎn Húli'')* Sihung Lung as Sir Te (T: 貝勒爺, C: 贝勒爷, P: ''Bèi-lèyé'')* Li Fazeng as Governor Yu* Gao Xi'an as Bo* Hai Yan as Madam Yu* Wang Deming as Police inspector Tsai / Prefect Cai Qiu* Huang Suying as Aunt Wu* Yang Rui as Maid* Li Kai as Gou Jun Pei* Feng Jianhua as Gou Jun Sinung* Ma Zhongxuan as Mi Biao* Li Baocheng as Fung Machete Chang* Yang Yongde as Monk Jing* Zhang Shaocheng as NightmanThemes and interpretations===TitleThe name "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon" is a literal translation of the Chinese idiom "臥虎藏龍" which describes a place or situation that is full of unnoticeable masters. It is from a poem of the ancient Chinese poet Yu Xin's (513-581) that reads "暗石疑藏虎，盤根似臥龍", which means "behind the rock in the dark probably hides a tiger, and the coiling giant root resembles a crouching dragon." The last character in Xiaohu and Jiaolong's names mean "Tiger" and "Dragon" respectively.Teacher-student relationshipA teacher's desire to have a worthy student, the obligations between a student and a master, and tensions in these relationships are central to the characters' motives, conflicts between the characters, and the unfolding of the film's plot. Li Mu Bai is burdened with the responsibility for avenging his master's death, and turns his back on retirement to live up to this obligation. His fascination with the prospect of having Jen as a disciple also motivates his behavior, and that of Jade Fox.Regarding conflicts in the student-teacher relationship, the potential for exploitation created by the subordinate position of the student and the tensions that exist when a student surpasses or resists a teacher are explored. Jen hides her mastery of martial arts from her teacher, Jade Fox, which leads both to their parting of ways and to Jade Fox's attempt on Jen's life. At the same time, Jade Fox's own unorthodox relationship with a Wudang master (who she claims would not teach her, but did take sexual advantage of her) brought her to a life of crime. At times, Li Mu Bai and Jen's conversations more than hint that the desire for a teacher-student relationship could turn into a romantic relationship.Jaffe, Valerie. , ''The Brooklyn Rail'', Feb/March 2001. Jen responds to these feelings, and her desire to not submit to a teacher, by turning away from Li Mu Bai when she jumps in the lake after the ''Green Destiny''.PoisonPoison is also a significant theme in the film. In the world of martial arts, poison is considered the act of one who is too cowardly and dishonorable to fight; and indeed, the only character that explicitly fits these characteristics is Jade Fox. The poison is a weapon of her bitterness,Fairlamb, Horace L. "Romancing the Tao: How Ang Lee Globalized Ancient Chinese Wisdom," ''symploke'' vol. 15, No. 1-2 (2007), p.196. and quest for vengeance: She poisons the master of Wudang, attempts to poison Jen, and succeeds in killing Mu Bai using a poisoned needle.However, the poison is not only of the physical sort: Jade Fox's tutelage of Jen has left Jen spiritually poisoned, which can be seen in the lying, stealing and betrayal Jen commits. Even though she is the one who initially trained Jen, Jen is never seen to use poison herself. This indicates that there is hope yet to reform her and integrate her into society. In further play on this theme by the director, Jade Fox, as she dies, refers to the poison from a young child, "the deceit of an eight-year-old girl," obviously referring to what she considers her own spiritual poisoning by her young apprentice Jen. Li Mu Bai himself warns that without guidance, Jen could become a "poison dragon."ProductionThe film was originally written as a novel series by Wang Dulu starting in the late 1930s. The film is adapted from the storyline of the fourth book in the series, ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon''.FilmingAlthough its Academy Award was presented to Taiwan, ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' was in fact an international co-production between companies in four regions: the Chinese company China Film Co-Production Corporation; the American companies Columbia Pictures Film Production Asia, Sony Pictures Classics and Good Machine; the Hong Kong company EDKO Film; and the Taiwanese Zoom Hunt International Productions Company, Ltd; as well as the unspecified United China Vision, and Asia Union Film ; Entertainment Ltd., created solely for this film.The film was made in Beijing, with location shooting in the Anhui, Hebei, Jiangsu and Xinjiang provinces of China. The first phase of shooting was in the Gobi Desert where it would consistently rain. Director Ang Lee noted that "I didn't take one break in eight months, not even for half a day. I was miserable -- I just didn't have the extra energy to be happy. Near the end, I could hardly breathe. I thought I was about to have a stroke." The stunt work was mostly performed by the actors themselves and Ang Lee stated in an interview that computers were used "only to remove the safety wires that held the actors." "Most of the time you can see their faces," he added, "That's really them in the trees."Another compounding issue was the difference between accents of the four lead actors: Chow Yun-fat is from Hong Kong and spoke Cantonese natively and Michelle Yeoh is from Malaysia and spoke English. Only Zhang Ziyi spoke with a native Mandarin accent that Ang Lee wanted."Time"Chow Yun Fat said that on "the first day [of shooting] I had to do 28 takes just because of the language. That's never happened before in my life.""Time"Because the film specifically targeted Western audiences rather than the domestic audiences who were already used to Wuxia films, English subtitles were needed. Ang Lee, who was educated in the West, personally edited the subtitles to ensure they were satisfactory for Western audiences.SoundtrackCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (soundtrack)The score was composed by Tan Dun, originally performed by Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, Shanghai National Orchestra, and Shanghai Percussion Ensemble. It also features many solo passages for cello played by Yo-Yo Ma. The "last track" (''A Love Before Time'') features Coco Lee, who later performed it at the Academy Awards. The music for the entire film was produced in two weeks.MarketingThe film was adapted into a video game, a comics series, and a 34-episode Taiwanese television series based on the original novel. The latter was released in 2004 as ''New Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' for US and Canadian release.ReceptionCritical response{|class="toccolours" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#FFFFE0; color:black; width:40em; max-width: 35%;" cellspacing="5"|style="text-align: left;"|"''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'', which is based on an early 20th century novel by Wang Dulu, unfolds much like a comic book, with the characters and their circumstances being painted using wide brush strokes. Subtlety is not part of Lee's palette; he is going for something grand and melodramatic, and that's what he gets."|-|style="text-align: left;"|—James Berardinelli, writing in ''ReelViews''|}''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' was very well received in the Western world, receiving universal acclaim and numerous awards. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 97% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 150 reviews. The site's consensus states: "The movie that catapulted Ang Lee into the ranks of upper echelon Hollywood filmmakers, ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' features a deft mix of amazing martial arts battles, beautiful scenery, and tasteful drama." Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 93 out of 100, based on 31 reviews.Some Chinese-speaking viewers were bothered by the accents of the leading actors. Neither Chow (a native Cantonese speaker) nor Yeoh (who was born and raised in Malaysia) speaks Mandarin as a mother tongue. All four main actors spoke with different accents: Chow speaks with a Cantonese accent;Hu, Brian (December 20, 2006). . ''UCLA Asia Institute''. Accessed December 30, 2006. Yeoh with a Malaysian accent; Chang Chen a Taiwanese accent; and Zhang Ziyi a Beijing accent. Yeoh responded to this complaint in a December 28, 2000, interview with ''Cinescape''. She argued that "My character lived outside of Beijing, and so I didn't have to do the Beijing accent." When the interviewer, Craig Reid, remarked that "My mother-in-law has this strange Sichuan-Mandarin accent that's hard for me to understand.", Yeoh responded: "Yes, provinces all have their very own strong accents. When we first started the movie, Cheng Pei Pei was going to have her accent, and Chang Zhen was going to have his accent, and this person would have that accent. And in the end nobody could understand what they were saying. Forget about us, even the crew from Beijing thought this was all weird."Reid, Craig (December 28, 2000). . ''Mania''. Accessed May 3, 2010.The film led to a boost in popularity of Chinese wuxia films in the western world, where they were previously little known, and led to films such as ''House of Flying Daggers'' and ''Hero'' marketed towards western audiences. The film also provided the breakthrough role for Zhang Ziyi's career, who noted that:Because of movies like ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'', and ''Hero'' and ''Memoirs of a Geisha'', a lot of people in the United States have become interested not only in me but in Chinese and Asian actors in general. Because of these movies, maybe there will be more opportunities for Asian actors."The character of Lo, or "Dark Cloud" the desert bandit, influenced the development of the protagonist of the ''Prince of Persia'' series of video games."''Prince of Persia'': Anatomy of a Prince", ''PlayStation: The Official Magazine'' 13 (December 2008): 50.The film is ranked at No. 497 on ''Empire'' magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time[The 500 Greatest Movies Of All Time].
