Overview of the CNO-I CycleThe '''CNO cycle''' (for carbon–nitrogen–oxygen) is one of the two (known) sets of fusion reactions by which stars convert hydrogen to helium, the other being the proton–proton chain reaction. Unlike the latter, the CNO cycle is a catalytic cycle. Theoretical models suggest that the CNO cycle is the dominant source of energy in stars more massive than about 1.3 times the mass of the Sun.salaris_cassini2005The proton–proton chain is more important in stars the mass of the Sun or less. This difference stems from temperature dependency differences between the two reactions; pp-chain reactions starts at temperatures around  (4megakelvins), making it the dominant energy source in smaller stars. A self-maintaining CNO chain starts at approximately , but its energy output rises much more rapidly with increasing temperatures. At approximately , the CNO cycle starts becoming the dominant source of energy.The Sun has a core temperature of around ,  and only  of  nuclei produced in the Sun are born in the CNO cycle. The CNO-I process was independently proposed by Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker|Carl von Weizsäckerand Hans Bethein 1938 and 1939, respectively.In the CNO cycle, four protons fuse, using carbon, nitrogen and oxygen isotopes as a catalyst, to produce one alpha particle, two positrons and two electron neutrinos.  Although there are various paths and catalysts involved in the CNO cycles, simply speaking all these cycles have the same net result::4 1+2 Electron→4+2 Positron+2 Electron+2 Electron neutrino+3 Gamma+24.7 MeV→4+2 Electron neutrino+3 Gamma+26.7 MeVThe positrons will almost instantly Electron–positron annihilation|annihilate with electrons, releasing energy in the form of gamma rays. The neutrinos escape from the star carrying away some energy. One nucleus goes to become carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopes through a number of transformations in an endless loop.Cold CNO cyclesUnder typical conditions found in stars, catalytic hydrogen burning by the CNO cycles is limited by proton captures.  Specifically, the timescale for beta decay of the radioactive nuclei produced is faster than the timescale for fusion.  Because of the long timescales involved, the cold CNO cycles convert hydrogen to helium slowly, allowing them to power stars in quiescent equilibrium for many years.CNO-IThe first proposed catalytic cycle for the conversion of hydrogen into helium was initially called the carbon–nitrogen cycle (CN cycle), also honorarily referred to as the Bethe–Weizsäcker cycle, because it does not involve a stable isotope of oxygen.  Bethe's original calculations suggested the CN-cycle was the Sun's primary source of energy, owing to the belief at the time that the Sun's composition was 10% nitrogen;"BetheBible"the solar abundance of nitrogen is now known to be less than half a percent.  This cycle is now recognized as the first part of the larger CNO nuclear burning network.  The main reactions of the CNO-I cycle are →→→→→→12:;;:{| border="0"|- style="height:2em;"|12||+||1||→||13||+||||||||+||1.95MeV|- style="height:2em;"|13||||||→||13||+||||+||||+||1.20MeV ||(half-life of 9.965 minutes, Springer, 2010, ISBN 9783642103681, page 233)|- style="height:2em;"|13||+||1||→||14||+||Gamma||||||+||7.54MeV|- style="height:2em;"|14||+||1||→||15||+||Gamma||||||+||7.35MeV|- style="height:2em;"|15||||||→||15||+||Positron||+||Electron Neutrino||+||1.73MeV||(half-life of 122.24 seconds"half-life-cn")|- style="height:2em;"|15||+||1||→||12||+||4||||||+||4.96MeV|}where the Carbon-12 nucleus used in the first reaction is regenerated in the last reaction.  After the two positrons emitted annihilate with two ambient electrons producing an additional 2.04 MeV, the total energy released in one cycle is 26.73 MeV; it should be noted that in some texts, authors are erroneously including the positron annihilation energy in with the beta-decay Q-value and then neglecting the equal amount of energy released by annihilation, leading to possible confusion.  All values are calculated with reference to the Atomic Mass Evaluation 2003.The limiting (slowest) reaction in the CNO-I cycle is the proton capture on 14. In 2006 it was experimentally measured down to stellar energies, revising the calculated age of globular clusters by around 1 billion years.The neutrinos emitted in beta decay will have a spectrum of energy ranges, because although momentum is conserved, the momentum can be shared in any way between the positron and neutrino, with either emitted at rest and the other taking away the full energy, or anything in between, so long as all the energy from the Q-value is used.  All momentum which get the electron and the neutrino together is not great enough to cause a significant recoil of the much heavier daughter nucleus;; and hence, its contribution to kinetic energy of the products, for the precision of values given here, can be neglected.  Thus the neutrino emitted during the decay of nitrogen-13 can have an energy from zero up to 1.20 MeV, and the neutrino emitted during the decay of oxygen-15 can have an energy from zero up to 1.73 MeV.  On average, about 1.7 MeV of the total energy output is taken away by neutrinos for each loop of the cycle, leaving about 25 MeV available for producing luminosity.CNO-IIIn a minor branch of the above reaction, that occurs in the Sun's core 0.04% of the time, the final reaction involving  shown above does not produce carbon-12 and an alpha particle, but instead produces oxygen-16 and a photon and continues →→→→→→15:;;:{| border="0"|- style="height:2em;"|15||+||1||→||16||+||Gamma||||||+||12.13MeV|- style="height:2em;"|16||+||1||→||17||+||Gamma||||||+||0.60MeV|- style="height:2em;"|17||||||→||17||+||Positron||+||Electron Neutrino||+||2.76MeV||(half-life of 64.49 seconds)|- style="height:2em;"|17||+||1||→||14||+||4||||||+||1.19MeV|- style="height:2em;"|14||+||1||→||15||+||Gamma||||||+||7.35MeV|- style="height:2em;"|15||||||→||15||+||Positron||+||Electron Neutrino||+||2.75MeV||(half-life of 122.24 seconds)|}Like the carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen involved in the main branch, the fluorine produced in the minor branch is merely an intermediate product and at steady state, does not accumulate in the star.CNO-IIIThis subdominant branch is significant only for massive stars.

The essential idea is that a radioactive species will capture a proton before it can beta decay, opening new nuclear burning pathways that are otherwise inaccessible.  Because of the higher temperatures involved, these catalytic cycles are typically referred to as the hot CNO cycles; because the timescales are limited by beta decays instead of proton captures, they are also called the beta-limited CNO cycles.HCNO-IThe difference between the CNO-I cycle and the HCNO-I cycle is that  captures a proton instead of decaying, leading to the total sequence →→→→→→12::{| border="0"|- style="height:2em;"|12||+||1||→||13||+||||||||+||1.95MeV|- style="height:2em;"|13||+||1||→||14||+||||||||+||4.63MeV|- style="height:2em;"|14||||||→||14||+||||+||||+||5.14MeV||(half-life of 70.641 seconds)|- style="height:2em;"|14||+||1||→||15||+||Gamma||||||+||7.35MeV|- style="height:2em;"|15||||||→||15||+||Positron||+||Electron Neutrino||+||2.75MeV||(half-life of 122.24 seconds)|- style="height:2em;"|15||+||1||→||12||+||4||||||+||4.96MeV|}HCNO-IIThe notable difference between the CNO-II cycle and the HCNO-II cycle is that  captures a proton instead of decaying, and neon is produced in a subsequent reaction on , leading to the total sequence →→→→→→15::{| border="0"|- style="height:2em;"|15||+||1||→||16||+||Gamma||||||+||12.13MeV|- style="height:2em;"|16||+||1||→||17||+||Gamma||||||+||0.60MeV|- style="height:2em;"|17||+||1||→||18||+||Gamma||||||+||3.92MeV|- style="height:2em;"|18||||||→||18||+||Positron||+||Electron Neutrino||+||4.44MeV||(half-life of 1.672 seconds)|- style="height:2em;"|18||+||1||→||15||+||4||||||+||2.88MeV|- style="height:2em;"|15||||||→||15||+||Positron||+||Electron Neutrino||+||2.75MeV||(half-life of 122.24 seconds)|}HCNO-IIIAn alternative to the HCNO-II cycle is that  captures a proton moving towards higher mass and using the same helium production mechanism as the CNO-IV cycle as 18→→→→→→18::{| border="0"|- style="height:2em;"|18||+||1||→||19||+||Gamma||||||+||6.41MeV|- style="height:2em;"|19||||||→||19||+||Positron||+||Electron Neutrino||+||3.32MeV||(half-life of 17.22 seconds)|- style="height:2em;"|19||+||1||→||16||+||4||||||+||8.11MeV|- style="height:2em;"|16||+||1||→||17||+||Gamma||||||+||0.60MeV|- style="height:2em;"|17||+||1||→||18||+||Gamma||||||+||3.92MeV|- style="height:2em;"|18||||||→||18||+||Positron||+||Electron Neutrino||+||4.44MeV||(half-life of 1.672 seconds)|}Use in astronomyWhile the total number of "catalytic" nuclei are conserved in the cycle, in stellar evolution the relative proportions of the nuclei are altered.  When the cycle is run to equilibrium, the ratio of the carbon-12/carbon-13 nuclei is driven to 3.5, and nitrogen-14 becomes the most numerous nucleus, regardless of initial composition.  During a star's evolution, convective mixing episodes moves material, within which the CNO cycle has operated, from the star's interior to the surface, altering the observed composition of the star.  Red giant stars are observed to have lower carbon-12/carbon-13 and carbon-12/nitrogen-14 ratios than do main sequence stars, which is considered to be convincing evidence for the operation of the CNO cycle.See also*Stellar nucleosynthesis, the whole topic*Triple-alpha process, how 12 is produced from lighter nucleiReferencesFurther reading**
