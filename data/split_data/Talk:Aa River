Anyone know for sure? - rmhermen:This is pretty much copied verbatim from the [1911 Britannica], so... ugen64 19:55, Aug 28, 2004 (UTC)This is a stub which was removed from the AA page.... it should be merged with this article at some point:'''Aa''' is the name of a large number of small European rivers.  The word is derived from the Old German ''aha'', cognate to the Latin ''aqua'', meaning water (cf. Ger. ''-ach''; Scand. ''å'', ''aa'', pronounced ''o'').  The following are the more important streams of this name:;mdash; Two rivers in the west of Russia, both falling into the Gulf of Riga, near Riga, which is situated between them; a river in the north of France, falling into the sea below Gravelines, and navigable as far as St Omer; and a river of Switzerland, in the cantons of Lucerne and Aargau, which carries the waters of Lakes Baldegger and Hallwiler into the Aar. In Germany there are the Westphalian Aa, rising in the Teutoburger Wald, and joining the Werre at Herford, the Münster Aa, a tributary of the Ems, and others.
