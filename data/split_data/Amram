Imran (disambiguation)In the Book of Exodus, '''Amram''' (;#8201;; "The people are exalted"}}) is the husband of Jochebed and father of Aaron, Moses and Miriam.In the BibleIn addition to being married to Jochebed, Amram is also described in the Bible as having been related to Jochebed prior to the marriage, although the exact relationship is uncertain; some Greek and Latin manuscripts of the Septuagint state that Jochebed was Amram's father's cousin, and others state that Amram was Jochebed's cousin, but the Masoretic text states that she was his father's sister.''New American Bible'', footnote to Exodus 6:20  He is praised for his faith in the Epistle to the Hebrews.11:23Textual scholars attribute the biblical genealogy to the Book of Generations, a hypothetically reconstructed document theorized to originate from a similar religiopolitical group and date to the priestly source.Richard Elliott Friedman, ''Who Wrote The Bible?'' According to critical scholars, the Torah's genealogy for Levi's descendants, is actually an aetiological myth reflecting the fact that there were four different groups among the levites – the Gershonites, Kohathites, Merarites, and Aaronids;''Peake's commentary on the Bible'' Aaron – the eponymous ancestor of the Aaronids – could not be portrayed as a brother to Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, as the narrative about the birth of Moses (brother of Aaron), which textual scholars attribute to the earlier Elohist source, mentions only that ''both'' his parents were Levites (without identifying their names). Critical scholars suspect that the Elohist account offers both matrilinial and patrilinial descent from Levites in order to magnify the religious credentials of Moses. "wnsmyy"In the Qur'an'''Amram''' is Arabicized to '''Imran''' (). In the Qur'an, the name Imran is used for the father of Moses and Aaron, as well as the father of Mary, mother of Jesus. This confusion is probably the result of a confusion about the name Miriam which is used to refer to the sister of Moses as well as Jesus's mother. This brings together two distinct individuals: the first one is Amram the father of Moses and the second one is Joachim the father of Mary, the mother of Jesus. Amram, the father of Moses and Aaron, is a revered patriarch of Islam. The Qur'an says:Although Muslim scholars have often debated over who this verse refers to, most classical commentators and modern translators have taken the opinion that this refers to Amram, the father of Moses and Aaron. Through him would come many other priests and prophets, including Anne, Elizabeth, Mary, John the Baptist and Jesus.Family treeAccording to the Septuagint, Amram's family tree would be as follows:According to the Masoretic Text, Amram's family tree would be:According to The Book of Jasher, Amram's family tree would be:Amram married his aunt, Jochebed, the sister of his father Kehath.The Book of Jasher 67:2; see also Exodus 6:20In rabbinical and apocryphal literatureIn the Apocryphal ''Testament of Levi'', it is stated that Amram was born, as a grandson of Levi, when Levi was 64 years old. The Exodus Rabbah argues that when the Pharaoh instructed midwives to throw male children into the Nile, Amram divorced Jochebed, who was three months pregnant with Moses at the time, arguing that there was no justification for the Israelite men to father children if they were just to be killed;Exodus Rabbah 1:17 however, the text goes on to state that Miriam, his daughter, chided him for his lack of care for his wife's feelings, persuading him to recant and marry Jochebed again. "ssdjlv"According to the Talmud, Amram promulgated the laws of marriage and divorce amongst the Jews in Egypt; the Talmud also argues that Amram had extreme longevity, which he used to ensure that doctrines were preserved through several generations.Despite the legend of his divorce and remarriage, Amram was also held to have been entirely sinless throughout his life, and was rewarded for this by his corpse remaining without any signs of decay.Baba Batra 17a  The other three  ancient Israelites who died without sin, being Benjamin, Jesse and Chileab.According to the Book of Jubilees, Amram was among the Israelites who took the bones of Jacob's sons (excluding those of Joseph) to Canaan for burial in the cave of Machpelah.Jubilees 46:11 Most of the Israelites then returned to Egypt but some remained in Canaan, including Amram who only returned somewhere up to forty years later.One of the Dead Sea Scrolls (4Q535, Manuscript B) is written from Amram's point of view, and hence has been dubbed the ''Testament of Amram''. The document is dated to the 2nd century BC and, in the form of a vision, briefly discusses dualism and the Watchers:See also* Aale Imran, 7References
