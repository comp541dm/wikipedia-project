'''Aimoin''' ( 960 – c. 1010), French chronicler, was born at Villefranche-de-Longchat about 960, and in early life entered the monastery of Fleury, where he became a monk and passed the greater part of his life.His chief work is a ''Historia Francorum'', or ''Libri v de Gestis Francorum'', which deals with the history of the Franks from the earliest times to 653, and was continued by other writers until the middle of the twelfth century. It was much in vogue during the Middle Ages, but its historical value is now regarded as slight.  It has been edited by G. Waitz and published in the ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores'', Band xxvi (Hanover and Berlin, 1826–1892).He also wrote a ''Vita Abbonis'', ''abbatis Floriacensis'', the last of a series of lives of the abbots of Fleury, all of which, except the life of Abbo, have been lost.  This has been published by J. Mabillon in the ''Acta sanctorum ordinis sancti Benedicti'' (Paris, 1668–1701).Aimoin's third work was the composition of books ii and iii of the ''Miracula sancti Benedicti'', the first book of which was written by another monk of Fleury named '''Adrevald'''. This also appears in the ''Acta sanctorum''.NotesReferences*External links*
