Too many, Afghanistan is thought of as the fifth poorest and most conservative Islamic country in the world. However, to those internationals that have been or live there know, it is a Country that grabs your imagination and despite all of its difficulties has something that makes almost all visitors say they will return to one day.  Daily life too many internationals, is far removed from what those see on the news and would expect - look at the restaurant listings on www.afghanguide.biz to get a feel for the unreported side of life that the public often misses.  My suggestion is to add a section to the Afghanistan over view on what day to day life is like for an international living in Country - it may be surprisingly normal.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/82.205.198.178|82.205.198.178 (talk) 09:54, 19 November 2007 (UTC);;; ;;''You may wish to add to the Economic Section'' →There are no Patent Laws in Afghanistan.   —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/68.165.234.141|68.165.234.141 (talk) 19:00, 18 February 2008 (UTC);;; ;;Excess section:The constitution of Afghanistan has no jurisdiction over the English language.

I'd do it myself (the way I rectified Morocco's atrocious infobox a couple of months ago), but obviously that's impossible now. There is NO REASON that the name of the country in the OFFICIAL LANGUAGE should be simply ignored in the infobox. For that matter, the first-line report of the native name in Pashto includes no transliteration--that's a serious problem, since not everyone can read Arabic script. Heck, I'm fluent in Arabic and I can only barely make out what it says, thanks to differences in the alphabet. Furthermore, what exactly IS the name of Afghanistan? There is consensus on "republic" for the translation, but is it "Jamhūrī" or "Dawlat"? The fa:افغانستان|Farsi article has it as "Jamhūrī"/whatever in both Pashto and Dari, but the German article has "Dawlat" for Pashto and "Jamhūrī" for Dari, and the French article has "Dawlat" for both!

Fighting continued among the victorious Mujahideen factions, eventually giving rise to a state of warlordism. The most serious fighting during this period occurred in 1994, when over 10,000 people were killed in Kabul alone. The chaos and corruption that dominated post-Soviet Afghanistan in turn spawned the rise of the Taliban. The Taliban developed as a politico-religious force, and eventually seized Kabul in 1996. By the end of 2000 the Taliban were able to capture 95% of the country, aside from the opposition (Northern Alliance) strongholds primarily found in the northeast corner of Badakhshan Province.

The problem is that only few of these editors are involved in doing this on Afghanistan related articles. It's 2 people who are extremely anti-Afghans, with a passion to hate all Pashtuns. One is banned editor Tajik and the other is banned editor Beh-nam, both of these banned editors claim to be Tajiks as well as Shias. These editors may not be ethnic Tajiks but are just saying so. Vandals will never tell the truth about anything. User:Tajik, for example is Qizilbash, and those are not considered Tajiks because Afghanistan's constitution explains that Tajiks and Qizilbash are separate ethnic groups. Most Sunni Tajiks get along with Pashtuns and they do recognize Pashtuns as the powerful ethnic group. Anyway, as a result of people placing false information, Wikipedia is not going to stay around for long. By October of this year (2008) Wikipedia will no longer exist.Pashtuns and Tajiks are Afghan regardless of ethnicity. For me it doesn't matter which ethnicity a person is from since I see myself only as an AFGHAN. But at the same time we can't take a person's identity from them or post false information. In order to have support and access with reliable source we need individuals who aren't taking sides or biased in any aspect.If you are an Admin or Mod than I would greately appreciate if you change Ahmad Zahir and put his true ethnic group/ identity. Anosha who is claiming that all evidence shows him being Tajik/Pashai yet he forgets family members know better than someone who is busy writting thier own false information. He knows that he is a Pashtun, but he won't change it because he is a famous Afghan singer not just in Afghanistan, but in Tajikistan and Iran for his style of singing and peotries. What if one day a family member yours wakes up and hears bunch of people claiming you aren't who you suppose to be  or change your identity. How would  you or your family feel even though they've tried to contact group who changed your identity  or background for personal agenda and purpose?That aside when informations are posted on Wikipedia we need to make sure we post accurate information not something personal. With the maps we see many districts which have mixed population marked as majority for one group and district which they should be majority is marked either mixed or for the opposite group.Truth always comes out and if it takes for wikipedia to go down so be it before it produces more false information and continue on with its inaccurate articles.--ProudAfghan4life (talk) 23:16, 27 January 2008 (UTC)I am also Shia.

From 2002 to 2007, over 4.5 million registered Afghan refugees returned back to their country and that makes a big difference. So the CIA information is not updated, if it was then there would be the year written next to the figures. In fact the CIA does not even have Afghanistan included in SAARC membership yet, when it joined the group of nations one year ago. So Britannica is more reliable than CIA. But Iranica must go because it is not showing us any current information. Also, the inferior and bogus looking ethnic maps must also go and be replaced by the better looking CIA maps.

I've copied and pasted, and removed what I think should be removed, thusly:Afghanistan, officially the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (Persian: جمهوری اسلامی افغانستان, Pashto: د افغانستان اسلامى جمهوريت ), is a landlocked country that is located approximately in the center of Asia. It is variously designated as geographically located within Central Asia,[3][4] South Asia,[5][6] and the Middle East.[7][8][9] It has religious, ethno-linguistic, and geographic links with most of its neighboring states. It is bordered by Pakistan in the south and east,[10] Iran in the west, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan in the north, and China in the far northeast.Afghanistan is a culturally diverse nation, lying [sic] on the crossroads between the East and the West. Historically, it has both seen various invaders and conquerors, and been the centre of emprires. In the 19th century, Afghanistan became a buffer state in "The Great Game" played between the British Indian Empire and Russian Empire. On 19 August, 1919, following the third Anglo-Afghan war, the country gained full independence from the United Kingdom over its foreign affairs. Since the late 1970s Afghanistan has suffered continuous civil war, which included foreign interventions in the form of the 1979 Soviet invasion and the 2001 US-led invasion that toppled the Taliban government.Carl.bunderson (talk) 08:36, 2 February 2008 (UTC)::The modern nation "Afghanistan", which this entire article is based on, was founded by Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1747. That must be mentioned in the intro. I think the way the intro was for last 1 year is perfect. It mentions all the major things instead of the unimportant ones. I don't like User:Carl.bunderson's version of the intro. Afghanistan has a very long history compare to many other nations so its expected to see a longer intro than others. What needs to be removed is the sentence '''"During the Cold War Afghanistan bordered the Soviet Union"''' in the first paragraph, that is unimportant...the sentence '''"Ariana was the original name of Afghanistan back in the 1700s"''' at the begining of the second paragraph must also be removed because that is absolutely false.--Special:Contributions/203.175.65.23|203.175.65.23 (talk) 19:42, 5 February 2008 (UTC)AnthemThe Afghan anthem on You-tube .Afghanistan's national anthem is the one which is being played inside Afghanistan.

Carl.bunderson (talk) 21:09, 5 February 2008 (UTC)::::You westerners may call it corruption but in Afghanistan or in many other Asian countries here it is called clean business. In the west I was constantly pulled over by police and forced to pay for speeding 10 miles above the limit, forgetting to wear seat belt or coming to a full stop at an intersection where "Stop" sign was placed. The westerners say that is serving and protecting the public. In Afghanistan is you violate the above vehicle rules a police officer takes money from you on the spot because there is no computerized ticket system there and you westerners say that is police corruption. This is how in many countries government collects their money. Another one, I made my 1 year Afghan passport in 2002 for $104, today the same 1 year passport costs about $20 only and a 5 year passport costs $104. This means corruption is declining and the government is beginning to use more computers so that everything can be verified. The country still needs some time to fix the problem. I agree there may be written the word corruption at the appropiate place but some people get carried away with this. They don't know what is happening in the country. I say corruption is the least problem for the country. It needs more electricity, water and gas pipelines lines to all homes, factories, foreign investment, etc.--Special:Contributions/203.175.65.97|203.175.65.97 (talk) 03:49, 6 February 2008 (UTC):::::Yes, thank you for your very insightful ''original research'', anon.

Without being an expert on the subject, I'm guessing it's the other way around: corruption ''causes'' poverty. How about Zimbabwe, a once-prosperous country (by Africian standards) that has been devastated by incompetence and corruption?I'll just explain why I'm here. My son is in the Danish army, and is currently serving in Kosovo with KFOR. Danish soldiers, along with soldiers from several other NATO countries, are currently fighting and dying in Afghanistan. Karzai and Bush want more soldiers to go to Afghanistan. But I'm seeing and reading all these reports about how the situation is deteriorating in Afghanistan, and one could get the (mistaken?) impression that fighting for Afghanistan is just fighting to keep a corrupt administration in power, to support an economy that is largely based on the production of heroin, and to make it possible for religious perverts to keep women subjugated and to execute anyone who disagrees with their doctrine.So being a Wikipedian, I look at the article about Afghanistan to get some insights as to what is really happening. But the current article is not of much help. Why is the Taliban resurgent? Is it true (as claimed on Danish radio) tht Karzai's government is one of the most corrupt on Earth? How is it possible for a guy to get a death sentence for downloading stuff from the Internet, at the same time as the country is asking for more Western soldiers to come and fight for them?

For instance, Khushal Khan Khattak is not from Afghanistan. He was born in Peshawar, Pakistan (please read his biography). Likewise with Rahman Baba, Ghani Khan, and Ameer Hamza Shinwari ('''none''' are from Afghanistan). And the last two; Ahmad Shah Durrani was not a poet but a 18th century warlord and Amir Karor never existed in real life (he was a fictional character which is why there is no article for him).So I'm wondering why this edit wasn't noticed or reverted? Especially by the user: Bejnar and user: Kingturtle and user: Carl.bunderson keep a close eye on this article. Why haven't they bothered to read the biographies of these individuals and find that they are not from Afghanistan, were not poets, or did not even exist? I don't know, maybe they support Pashtun/Afghan nationalist (Pashtunization) POVs and fabrications?The important thing is I've now pointed it out and someone can now fix that wrong edit. Thanks. DurraniPashtun (talk) 06:02, 26 February 2008 (UTC):I have deleted the lists which are more appropriate in the Persian poetry and Pashto literature and poetry articles.

Carl.bunderson (talk) 20:38, 26 February 2008 (UTC)Again Bejnar and Carl.bunderson show there support of Pashtun/Afghan nationalism. When exposed that they allowed wrong information there and allowed Pashtun poets that aren't even from Afghanistan there, they then decided to remove the Persian poets as well (who are actually from modern Afghanistan). For several years no one objected to these poets since Persian poetry is a very important element of the culture in about 3/4 of Afghanistan, now these two Afghan nationalist supporters claim there is no good reason for them to be there just because there are no Pashto poets from Afghanistan. DurraniPashtun (talk) 21:48, 26 February 2008 (UTC):I should note that I have been threatened with disbarment for sticking my nose into this.  I tend to agree with DurraniPashtun.

Kingturtle (talk) 03:00, 27 February 2008 (UTC):Durrani, I didn't do the edits you requested because I don't know enough about Afghan poetry to do what you wanted. I thought Bejnar had done what you asked. I really think that if the people who know about the subject come to an agreement about what should be maintained, and what should be taken out, we don't need an RfA. That's an extreme step. I merely took offence at Erxnmedia's reversion of Bejnar, because it looked to me like Bejnar had done what Durrani asked. Let's all just take time to talk about the entire section, and please explain reasons behind why you think things should be maintained/deleted, for those of us who are mostly ignorant of Afghanistan and who can only recognize the most blatantly false of false content (ie me). Carl.bunderson (talk) 03:07, 27 February 2008 (UTC)Bejnar did not do what I asked. He did the total opposite. I asked for the Pashtun poets from Pakistan and persons who are not even poets or were fictional characters be removed. Bejnar instead removed ALL the Persian who poets '''who were all from modern Afghanistan''' and wrote an extremely POV paragraph instead! And you support him? For the moment the revision should be what User: Erxnmedia had. Bejnar will have to tell us why he did what he did. DurraniPashtun (talk) 03:15, 27 February 2008 (UTC):Bejnar also wrote his other POV that Dari (the name for Persian in Afghanistan) and Persian are two different languages. This is what he wrote: ''"Afghanistan has produced poets, writing Persian poetry, Pasto poetry and even Dari poetry."'':That makes no sense and with that sentence he maintains his POV that Dari (Persian) and Persian are different poetry. He's an extreme Afghan nationalist and very anti-Persian. DurraniPashtun (talk) 03:19, 27 February 2008 (UTC)::You're the one who started this whole thing, why don't you just edit to how you want it to be, Durrani? Carl.bunderson (talk) 03:22, 27 February 2008 (UTC)Started what thing? user: Shikab added a bunch of poets who are not even from Afghanistan and I asked them to be removed since they are not from Afghanistan, so what did I start? I am not editing it because only old users can edit at the moment and because user: Erxnmedia already fixed it. DurraniPashtun (talk) 03:25, 27 February 2008 (UTC):I thought you started this because it seemed that Bejnar's contentious edit was in response to the request you had at the start of this thread. And sorry about that, I had forgotten that new users can't edit this article. And how did Erxn fix it? All he's done is maintain the status quo, which you were commenting on/complaining about in the first place. The status quo may be better than Bejnar's version, but it can't be what you want, since it is the version with which you were dis-satisfied to begin with.

Basically all we needed to do was undo the following edit (] was created as a nation in 1947, after the death of all those Pashtun poets. —Preceding unsigned comment added by GingizKhan (talk • Special:Contributions/GingizKhan|contribs) 08:45, 27 February 2008 (UTC);;; ;;Population distribution pictureHi,Per request fromDurraniPashtun, I have added another population distribution picture.He has issues with the current picture, so I put both pictures in and identified the data sources and time of creation of both pictures.  Having both pictures is easier because both are sincere efforts and there was a bit of a delete war as to which picture was preferable.DurraniPashtun, please supply commentary in the Afghanistan#Ethnic groups section giving references to support why the picture I have added is more authoritative than the 1997 U. of Texas picture.Also note that the sources for the picture you asked me to include are diverse and unclear, for example, the image sources it to "AIMS".  Under AIMS there is a red link to Arab International Media Services but the only such thing I could find is .  Perhaps you could add an article for Arab International Media Services and comment on the sources of data and methods of collection and who collected and when it was collected for the picture that you prefer.  The caption gives numbers from CIA 2007 and Encyclopedia Iranica 2007, but the picture itself when you go to the image description does not reference CIA, so it is not clear that the areas outlined in the picture are proportional numerically to the aggregate numbers culled from CIA and Encyclopedia Iranica.:AIMS, with regard to Afghanistan, is usually "Afghanistan Information Management Services", a UN based a joint venture between UNOCHA and UNDP, which acts as an information clearinghouse and coordinator for assistance organizations (NGOs) working in Afghanistan. See [Afghanistan Information Management Services website].--Bejnar (talk) 16:27, 27 February 2008 (UTC)::OK I've added this AIMS as Afghanistan Information Management Services.  Erxnmedia (talk) 17:02, 27 February 2008 (UTC)Also I am not a master of image graphic placement in Wikipedia so I may have messed up the aesthetics of the following section on Languages which was otherwise wedging itself between the two pictures which I placed side-by-side below the text for comparison purposes.  Anybody who'd like to clean up the framing please do so.  I would like the two ethnographic pictures to be same size and somewhat readable for comparison, so a little bigger than thumbnails.Thanks,Erxnmedia (talk) 04:43, 27 February 2008 (UTC):DurraniPashtun is another sockpuppet of the controversial banned editor User:Beh-nam and you are helping him with his controversial edits. The falsified colorful ethnic map was made by him, who is a racist person towards Pashtuns. He is a Tajik but giving himself names as Pashtun. As a result of all these findings I am reverting all your edits because you are clearly here to support a sockpuppet and that is against the rules of Wikipedia.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by GingizKhan (talk • Special:Contributions/GingizKhan|contribs) 08:39, 27 February 2008 (UTC);;; ;;Wow!!  Everybody thinks everybody else is a sockpuppet on this page!  The unsigned comment above is by User:GingizKhan who somebody else has branded with the scarlet letter of sockpuppetry!How about if we identify each picture by source of data, time of collection, etc. as I specified above???  Sockpuppets of any persuasion can do that.Thanks,Erxnmedia (talk) 13:34, 27 February 2008 (UTC)fictional picture of Ahmad Shah Durrani coronationThat image was fictional and not historical so it was removed from the history section.

The entry should be clear that the map is not from the CIAWF but the data below it is.I would like the editors to correct the grammar and clarify this statement. I suggest:"The most common languages spoken in Afghanistan are Persian (Dari dialects) and Pashto. Both are Indo-European languages from the Iranian languages sub-family.

Carl.bunderson (talk) 19:04, 7 March 2008 (UTC)Aryans in AfghanistanPeople assume that Aryans went to Afghanistan which is a lie. According to the ancient Indian books the Afghans were called Pakhta and the tribes living in the Afghanistan are were called Mleccha, which means a non-Aryan people. Note that the use of the word Aryan in India is the oldest. Afghans aren't Aryans but most do speak Indo-European languages which is not necessary similar to Aryan language. Please remove this from the History of Afghanistan.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/213.10.173.29|213.10.173.29 (talk) 21:40, 10 March 2008 (UTC);;; ;;Bejnar pushing for his Afghan-nationalist POVs againBejnar claims that Dari is not Persian but "Eastern Farsi". Can someone let Bejnar know that "Farsi" is the local name of Persian? It is Persian in English and this is an English Wikipedia so for language it should be '''Persian''' or '''Persian (Dari)''' like how it was before.Bejnar should also read the actual "Dari article", see '''Dari (Persian)'''.:In addition, this has already been thoroughly discussed on the Dari (Persian) article and Bejnar's POVs were disproved there and there was consensus there. He lost his push for his POVs there and now he is here pushing the same POV. See ''''''.::There was no consensus.  No real linguists showed up. I am not pushing a POV, I am trying to keep this article unaffected by the arguments both ways. The language is officially Dari, so that is what the infobox should say. Arguing either for its total identification with the language spoken in Teheran or against that identification should be kept out of the infobox.  --Bejnar (talk) 04:00, 12 March 2008 (UTC)::: You are totally lost and don't have a clue what you're talking about. user: alidoostzadeh is an expert on Persian language while you are totally lost and rely on a Ethnologue to have the little information you have. There was consensus by definition on that talk page. Anyone can read it and see you are lying as usual and manipulated things to push for your POVs as usual. Dari is another name for Persian. Like how German is another name for Deutch. There was a very long discussion on this on that article and you didn't even take part in it because you did not have anything to counter with other than your source Ethnologue which is not scholarly and claims Persian in Afghanistan is "Eastern Farsi". Ok, let's say it is Eastern Farsi. Farsi in English is Persian. So then by your own argument you should have '''Eastern Persian''' in the infobox. Though that wouldn't make sense since we don't say Eastern-Western English. It's all one English. By the way, insisting on using Dari over Persian is a POV according to the Encyclopedia Iranica.The Encyclopaedia Iranica writes: ''Darī (q.v.) is a term long recommended by Afghan authorities;/u; to designate Afghan Persian in contrast to Iranian Persian; a written language common to all educated Afghanis, Darī must not be confused with Kābolī;/u;, the dialect of Kabul and surrounding areas that is more or less understood by eighty percent of the non-Persian speaking population and is fast becoming the nation's koine. [...] The revival of the ancient term ''Darī'' was intended to signify that Afghans consider their country the cradle of the language;/u;. Hence, the name Fārsī, the language of Fārs, is strictly avoided;/u;.'' ("Modern literature of Afghanistan" by R. Farhādī, Encyclopaedia Iranica, xii, Online Edition, );/big;:::Clearly it is your POV or at least you are supporting the Afghan nationalist POV. If you don't want to take sides as you claim, then the correct thing to do would be to have it the way it was before as '''Persian (Dari)''', or '''Persian (officially designated as Dari)'''. Because Dari is not a language it is not recognized as a language own.Carl.bunderson edit::My recent edit should have read tag deletion, not ref; it finished before I realized my edit summary was wrong.
