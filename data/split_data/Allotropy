AllotrophyFile:Diamond and graphite.jpg|thumb|300px|Diamond and graphite are two allotropes of carbon: pure forms of the same element that differ in crystalline structure.'''Allotropy''' or '''allotropism''' () is the property of some chemical elements to exist in two or more different forms, in the same physical state, known as ''allotropes'' of these elements. Allotropes are different structural modifications of an element; the atoms of the element are bonded together in a different manner. For example, the allotropes of carbon include diamond (where the carbon atoms are bonded together in a tetrahedral lattice arrangement), graphite (where the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets of a hexagonal lattice), graphene (single sheets of graphite), and fullerenes (where the carbon atoms are bonded together in spherical, tubular, or ellipsoidal formations). The term ''allotropy'' is used for elements only, not for compounds. The more general term, used for any crystalline material, is polymorphism. Allotropy refers only to different forms of an element within the same phase (i.e. different solid, liquid or gas forms); these different states are not, themselves, considered to be examples of allotropy.For some elements, allotropes have different molecular formulae which can persist in different phases – for example, two allotropes of oxygen (dioxygen, O2, and ozone, O3), can both exist in the solid, liquid and gaseous states. Conversely, some elements do not maintain distinct allotropes in different phases – for example phosphorus has numerous solid allotropes, which all revert to the same P4 form when melted to the liquid state.HistoryThe concepts of allotropy was originally proposed in 1841 by the Swedish scientist Baron Jöns Jakob Berzelius (1779–1848).. The term is derived from the Greek  (''allotropia''; variability, changeableness).. After the acceptance of Avogadro's hypothesis in 1860 it was understood that elements could exist as polyatomic molecules, and the two allotropes of oxygen were recognized as O2 and O3.JensenIn the early 20th century it was recognized that other cases such as carbon were due to differences in crystal structure.By 1912, Ostwald noted that the allotropy of elements is just a special case of the phenomenon of polymorphism known for compounds, and proposed that the terms allotrope and allotropy be abandoned and replaced by polymorph and polymorphism.JensenAlthough many other chemists have repeated this advice, IUPAC and most chemistry texts still favour the usage of allotrope and allotropy for elements only.Differences in properties of an element's allotropesAllotropes are different structural forms of the same element and can exhibit quite different physical properties and chemical behaviours.  The change between allotropic forms is triggered by the same forces that affect other structures, i.e. pressure, light, and temperature.  Therefore, the stability of the particular allotropes depends on particular conditions. For instance, iron  changes from a body-centered cubic structure (ferrite) to a face-centered cubic structure (austenite) above 906°C, and tin undergoes a modification known as tin pest from a metallic form to a semiconductor form below 13.2°C (55.8°F). As an example of allotropes having different chemical behaviour, ozone (O3) is a much stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen (O2).List of allotropesTypically, elements capable of variable coordination number and/or oxidation states tend to exhibit greater numbers of allotropic forms.  Another contributing factor is the ability of an element to catenate.Examples of allotropes include:Non-metals{| class="wikitable"|-! Element!
