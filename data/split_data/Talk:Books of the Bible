ReorganizationI have reorganized the list as to who's list is older. That is: Tanakh, a table listing a difference between the Prod/Cath OTs, the apocrypha, and the NT. -- iHoshie 08:35, 25 Jan 2004 (UTC): The current list appears to have dropped the deuterocanonical books of the Septuagint not kept by the Roman Catholics but retained by the Orthodox that were listed as groups B., C., and D. above. I noticed when I tried to find 3rd and 4th Maccabees. Did they just get missed in the reorganization? Wesley 05:07, 30 May 2004 (UTC): I just added an Orthodox column to the end, because that was easiest. It still has a couple of omissions, and one or two more footnotes wouldn't hurt. The Orthodox Bible has a Psalm 151, and a few more verses at the end of Job telling who he is and how he's related to Abraham, for instance. Wesley \: To keep the columns ordered by age, I believe the Protestant column would come last; not sure how the Catholic and Orthodox columns would be sequenced, probably matters far less in that case. Wesley 16:55, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)WikiProjectBased on a suggestion in Wikipedia:Pages needing attention, I have started the skeleton of a WikiProject to try to cut down on the overlap between the various presentations of the canon. I think that a lot of people working here will want input on this. Feel free! Mpolo 13:24, Sep 14, 2004 (UTC)Location Isaiah, Jeremiah and EzekhielWhy aren't the three books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekhiel in the Tanakh at the same level with the corresponding three books in the Christian Bibles in the table? Thanks. (Bronto)Same question. Also, if the intention is to list the books in the order used in the holy book in question, shouldn't that be mentioned in the description?

Portress 01:52, 27 May 2005 (UTC)TitleShould Revelation be labeled as ''The Prophecy'' or just ''Prophecy'', or some other name such as ''Apocalyptic Literature'' or ''Prophetic Literature''...surely some terms similar to the latter ones have wide currency in academic Biblical scholarship. --Dpr 03:45, 13 September 2005 (UTC)*I've heard it most commonaly called "apocalyptic literature" (like the book of Daniel).It is called "Revelation" or "The Apocalypse of John" (aka "The Apocalypse of St. John"). People commonly (but incorrectly) refer to it as "RevelationS" (plural). "Apocalypse" means Revelation (translated from the Greek) so this is the most often used named in scholarly circles. I've never heard it referred to as "The Prophecy" by anyone in academia, or anywhere outside this discussion page, actually... [Paraforce]RevelationI think it would be wise to change “The Prophecy” for “Apocalypse”. Where it says “Revelation11 or Apocalypse” we should change it for “Revelation11 of John”, since we have many people with their “own” version of the book of “revelations”. Also “Apocalypse” is not the name of the book but it is a stile of writing just as an epistle or biography.Licio 15:36, 21 February 2006 (UTC)Proposed changes to tableI'm proposing the following changes to the table:# Mark with an asterisk those books which are present, but in a different order (e.g. Ruth in the Tanakh column), and adding the name if it is different (e.g. Chronicles).# Move the "''Nevi'im or Prophets''" and "''Ketuvim or Writings''" headings under the Tanakh column.# Add column and row boundaries for "asterisked" cells (e.g. Isaiah)# Make column boundaries continuous, (e.g. add boundaries between the Protestant and Catholic columns at 3 and 4 Maccabees), except at subsection headings (e.g. "Historical books'')# Eliminate row boundaries between missing books (e.g. eliminate boundaries between 2 and 3 Maccabees, in the Protestant column)These changes would produce the following table. Comments? If no one objects, I will make these changes.Paul August User_talk:Paul August|;#9742; 05:08, 12 March 2006 (UTC)Ok, apparently someone has gone ahead and made this changes already.

A recent edit insinuates that the Odes of Solomon were in the Orthodox canon of Scripture. However, older edits mention a Book of Odes which includes the Prayer of Manasseh and others. I reverted to the previous version in the hopes someone will be able to bring some clear info to light. Yahnatan 21:53, 17 April 2006 (UTC):Using just "Odes" doesn't even lead to you a bible book at all.  Either Odes of Solomon or Book of Odes is what is needed. Harvestdancer 20:16, 5 May 2006 (UTC)Esther and Song of Songs not in the Bible?I found a seemingly odd, unsourced claim in the Deuterocanonical books article.  Who considers Esther and Song of Songs to be Deuterocanonical? RK 02:38, 6 July 2006 (UTC)Contradiction between Deuterocanonical books and Books of the Bible articlesIn the Deuterocanonical books article, it is implied that Protestants do not have ''any'' of the deuterocanonical books in their canon at all, except for these three:* 1 Esdras* 2 Esdras* Prayer of ManassehYet the Books of the Bible article does not list these three books.  (Nor does it list any of the other deuterocanonical books.  Which article is correct?  And is it really true that ''all'' Protestant groups reject all of the other Deuterocanonical books?  And do any Catholic Bibles include these three texts as valid deuterocanonicals? RK 02:38, 6 July 2006 (UTC):my family is lutheran (i'm an atheist though) and indeed protestant bibles exclude the deuterocanonical books (judith, tobias, wisdom, baruch, ben sira, maccabees 1 and 2 and . most protestants anyway - I know mormons have additional books of their own. Catholics regard 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras and Prayer of Manasseh as apocryphal though. --Philo 11:53, 6 July 2006 (UTC);Major and Minor. How about Former and LatterThough there is no distinction between Major nad Minor prophets in the Tanakh, the "N" (i.e. Neviim) are divided into two categories. Rishonim and Acharonim (Priori and Posteriori). Joshua, Judges, Samuel 1-2, Kings 1-2 are considered Neviim Rishonim, whereas the rest are considered Latter Prophets. Perhaps that ought to be included. I understand that would be hard to fit into the graph, but at least in text...Table explanationI propose removing reference what missing books are called.  The sentence is not NPOV.  In fact, it is dual-POV.  There is not set list for what is apocrypha, so using a potentianally prejoritive term like that out of context takes away from the article's neutrality on the topic.  (Proper context for apocrypha being an article about Apocrypha).  Since the topic is covered elsewhere in the article, and in its own article, it's a bit overstated when included in the table's description. Fcsuper 01:03, 26 April 2007 (UTC)Minor AlterationsThe new format makes sense, but I don't think that we should refer to the Old Testament in the Christian canons as Tanakh because it's strictly Jewish term, and should only be used for the Hebrew canon. And also, earlier, I've altered the names to most books in the Catholic canon to correspond to the Douay-Rheims and other Catholic Bibles (eg. Knox), which include Latinised names (particularly in the prophets), and other variants. --Revolution 9 16:47, 12 May 2007 (UTC)Some Bibles order the OT according to the Tanakh.

It is a very basic listing of the Books of the Bible with links to the books themselves, and should satisfy the needs of the many who don't want to get into any issues about canonicity.

Which books do they so admit? Not just all the deuterocanonical books recognized by the Roman Catholics, but also: 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras and the Prayer of Manasses.I point this out because discussion of the Protestant Bible ignores the fact that these books are part of the Anglican tradition - they were included in the Lectionary of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer. There have been new lectionaries since, in 1871, 1922 and others since then - but these books were read in church in the Anglican tradition - and they included the 3 books from the Vulgate that were dropped by the RCs at Trent.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/86.143.14.249|86.143.14.249 (talk) 18:57, 22 August 2010 (UTC);; ;;Book OrderIt would be better to split the New Testament orders under "Catholic, E. Orthodox, Protestant, and most O. Orthodox".  There are different orders in teh Slavonic, Armenian and Ethiopian traditions.  Someone has merged these together and gives teh false impression that they all use the same book order.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/92.19.183.89|92.19.183.89 (talk) 13:12, 7 April 2011 (UTC);; ;;I support such a change  User:MikeBeckett  Please do say 'Hi!' 23:07, 12 May 2011 (UTC)  —Preceding unsigned comment added by MikeBeckett (talk • Special:Contributions/MikeBeckett|contribs) ;;; ;;Apocrypha orderIf someone could write one of those nice, colored cell-by-cell templates like there are for the OT and NT books for the Apocrypha, listing "Protestant Apocrypha", "Catholic Deuterocanon", "Greek Orthodox Anagignoskomena", "Slavic Orthodox Anagignoskomena", "Syrian Orthodox Peshitta-Canon", "Ethiopian Orthodox Narrow Canon (Haile Selassie Enumeration)", and "Ethiopian Orthodox Broader Canon (Common Enumerations)", it would be much appreciated. Only the Deuterocanon/Pseudepigrapha section doesn't have an ordered cell-table now. JohnChrysostom (talk) 05:51, 19 January 2012 (UTC):Well, the Protestant Bible doesn't include the Apocrypha at all, so there is no order to be given in that situation.  However, I could set up something like you describe as long as I had an ordered list to work from. --EncycloPetey (talk) 02:01, 20 January 2012 (UTC):I'm trying to work it out on my own (how to write tables), but I believe there is an essential order for Protestant Apocrypha even if they're not canonical: they appear in this order in every Protestant Bible w/ Apocrypha; that is, starting with 3 Esdras and ending with 4 Maccabees. User:JohnChrysostom|St'''JohnChrysostom'''view/Special:Contributions/JohnChrysostom|mybias 12:22, 29 January 2012 (UTC)::In which Protestant Bibles did you find the Apocrypha? I usually have to hunt for a version that includes them.  Wouldn't that make ''omission'' the "standard order"?  --EncycloPetey (talk) 17:17, 29 January 2012 (UTC)::Many more liberal Protestant Bibles, all ecumenical Bibles, and all scholarly Bibles tend to include them, such as the RSV, the NRSV, the NEB, the REB, the New Interpreter's Study, the Harper-Collins, the New Oxford Annotated, etc. (as well as older Bibles, such as the KJV, New Cambridge Paragraph, etc.); more conservative Bibles such as the NKJV and NASB, heavily used by Fundamentalists and/or Evangelicals, tend not to. The ESV is a rare exception, in that Oxford has released an addition with the deuterocanonicals/apocrypha, while it is becoming the "Evangelical Standard Version" (I used the ESV heavily myself, as a Catholic). I recommend, if you wish to study the Apocrypha, for scholarly study, the New Oxford Annotated Bible, 3rd Expanded Edition (1977). It comes with all of the normal drawbacks of the RSV translation. One can also buy the NRSV NOAB Apocrypha (annotated) and KJV apocrypha separately, if you don't want them between the covers of your Bible. Of course, all Catholic and Orthodox Bibles (NAB, DRC, OSB, NABRE, CCD, JB, NJB) and Septuagint translations (Brenton, NETS) include them.

Previously the ''Ketuvim'' books were separated out from the rest of the chart and added to the bottom of the chart as a separate list.  This made it appear (without close inspection and mental collation) that there was a massive difference between the Jewish ''Tanakh'' and the Christian ''Old Testament'', which, of course, there is not.  The Hebrew Bible and the Protestant Old Testament are even identical in content.  This is made much more plain by the collation job done.  I marked the ''Ketuvim'' books in bold, and I footnoted each one so that there would be no confusion with the ''Nevi'im'' books.  I think this brings much more clarity to the chart, which before seemed rather confusing. -- User:Guðsþegn|Guðsþegn (User talk:Guðsþegn|talk) 23:36, 13 October 2012 (UTC)Christian BooksCan someone please add a Christian (not Catholic) table I'm having trouble making one.

Evensteven (talk) 17:55, 29 October 2015 (UTC)You stated that the order of the books of the Bible (specifically the New Testament) varies based on the denomination.  This may be true, but the statement in the article that the order you have is accepted by most Protestants, Catholics, and Greek Orthodox is not.  You can see the Catholic order . Just on the bookshelf of my office, the same order is used in the NIV, NRSV, CEB, KJV, NKJV, TEV, CEV, RSV, and New Oxford Annotated Bible.  All of these versions are used regularly across Protestant denominations.  In fact, this is the order found in both my Greek texts: "A Reader's Greek New Testament: 2nd Edition" by Goodrich and Lukaszewski and "The Greek New Testament: 4th Revised Edition" edited by Aland et. al.  Every Bible Commentary in my office, including the New Interpreter's Bible and The Interpreter's Bible has them in this order; however, to be fair, they do rely on the NIV and NRSV (former) and RSV and KJV (latter).  You can also find this order in Box 1.4 on page 10 of "The New Testament (4th ed)" by Bart D. Ehrman.I would request one of two things happen.  1) The correct order as cited above be placed in the article or 2) Both your order and the order I cited above be placed in the article with the statement that this order is the one used by most Protestant denominations as well as Roman Catholics.  I have been unable to confirm that the Greek Orthodox use this order.In the interest of learning, would you tell me which denominations use the order you have, and where this can be found?  I was unable to find it in any google search.Pastor Melissa (talk) 16:20, 29 October 2015 (UTC)Pastor Melissa:You appear to be new to Wikipedia. Welcome! I assume you are IP 50.195.146.93 who made the edits I recently reverted.:I wasn't calling into question the accuracy of your changes. I was questioning the editing process. Edit summaries are fine for simple matters, but it's clear that the book order in the Bible tends to be more complex, and moreover, could be subject to partisan rivalries among editors. The article has been stable for some time, indicating its original state has been generally acceptable to the community of editors who watch it, representing an editing consensus (click or right-click on the blue word to bring up the editorial consensus policy). That consensus can change, but my action in reverting you was designed to draw attention to your edits so that sufficient attention could be drawn, and its desirability be weighed also by experienced editors here. The edit summaries could not explain your reasons or approach sufficiently for due consideration to be given (there just isn't room there). Now you have responded, quite perfectly I might add, and everyone can see your thoughts, which also appear to me to be quite reasonable.:The various Biblical versions don't just differ in order, of course, but in content (differences in accepted Biblical canon), and in grouping. Protestants eliminate several books (sometimes differently from each other too), often calling them Apochrypha, while Catholics and Orthodox take them as canonical (the Orthodox accept a couple more than Catholic). Western translations tend to stick with content and order as in the Vulgate, whereas Orthodox used the Greek of the Septuagint (I assume that's the basis for your "Greek" versions). Different orderings might be useful to different people for different reasons, depending on how far they are going into historical development of the canon and collections of original texts. In addition, while Protestant-oriented ordering may be natural to many westerners who speak English, there are also a great many English speakers worldwide of Catholic and Orthodox backgrounds, and all such use English Wikipedia.:I don't really oppose your changes. I hope I merely brought up a few things you may not yet have considered in approaching Wikipedia, asking that you give them what you consider to be proper weight. Then, if you still wish your changes to be made, it's ok with me if you want to revert my reversion. And now all the other editors here can also weigh in with any comments they want to bring, and respond to changes with a good idea of what's going on. Please be aware that we on Wikipedia often get editing from IP addresses (essentially anonymous) who leave behind a very few edits, all too often without merit or appreciation of things they haven't thought about. While yours did not have the earmarks of the less knowledgeable of those, I hope you now have also gained some insight into how valuable editorial review can be, and why we may pause to consider before going ahead with changes. Welcome again, and I hope we see you again in the Christianity pages. Evensteven (talk) 17:44, 29 October 2015 (UTC):::The section I actually wished to change was the New Testament ordering. The Hebrew Bible/Old Testament list on the page seemed to do a good job of showing the variety of possible orders. As such, no, the Greek texts I used are not based on the Septuagint.  They are compiled from a variety of manuscripts and are the two texts used most often in Koine Greek classes in undergraduate and graduate studies.  The manuscripts most used in the one I prefer, edited by Aland et al, comes from papyri, uncials, miniscules, lectionaries, and several more.  I have never seen arguments before about the ordering of the New Testament, so discovering this problem on Wikipedia surprised me.  Admittedly, I do live in the US, but I have not been able to find any non-western sources that confirm a different order of the New Testament canon either.:::Thank you for the insight into how editorial changes should be made.  In the future, should I encounter something I would like to add or edit, should I come to a page like this before making a change? Pastor Melissa (talk) 18:25, 29 October 2015 (UTC)Pastor Melissa::::Yes, this is the place for anything that needs the consideration of the editing community, and that isn't readily addressed in simple fashion by edit comments themselves. But in many small matters, the edit comment alone is sufficient. So it's often a judgment call where to go first, and often the talk page is used once it's clear that there's an actual question that needs resolving.::::As for arguments on Wikipedia, I can't say I've seen one specifically about Bible book order, either Testament, but stuff that is associated with differences among the churches can be sensitive, and I was seeking only to get explicit confirmation that all sides were fine. But as for your changes being to the New Testament ordering, indeed I see it now, but somehow I was thinking OT at the time I reverted you. That was completely my own blunder, for which I apologize. If I had only seen that aright the first time, I would have let your edit pass without all this commentary, and I would not have considered the matter to be sensitive. For indeed, I know of no real differences in NT canon, or ordering. I've only ever heard of infrequent criticisms of an early Reformation leader or two regarding bits from a couple of the general epistles, but nothing that altered it in major ways. Anyway, I hope I haven't influenced you to become too shy. After all, two more WP policies talk about editing boldly, and how to respond when that doesn't work out the first time, so no one really needs to walk on eggshells either. Don't worry, you're doing great! Evensteven (talk) 19:07, 29 October 2015 (UTC)
