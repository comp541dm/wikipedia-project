The '''Callitrichidae''' (also called '''Arctopitheci''' or '''Hapalidae''') is a family of New World monkeys, including marmosets and tamarins. At times, this group of animals has been regarded as a subfamily, called Callitrichinae, of the family Cebidae.This taxon was traditionally thought to be a primitive lineage, from which all the larger bodied platyrrhines evolved. However, some works argue that callitrichids are actually a dwarfed lineage.Naish, Darren. . Scientific American November 27, 2012Ancestral stem-callitrichids would likely have been "normal" sized ceboids that were dwarfed through evolutionary time. This may exemplify a rare example of insular dwarfing in a mainland context, with the "islands" being formed by biogeographic barriers during arid climatic periods when forest distribution became patchy, and/or by the extensive river networks in the Amazon Basin."Ford1980"All callitrichids are arboreal. They are the smallest of the simian primates. They eat insects, fruit, and the sap or gum from trees; occasionally they will take small vertebrates. The marmosets rely quite heavily on tree exudates, with some species (e.g. ''Callithrix jacchus'' and ''Cebuella pygmaea'') considered obligate exudativores.Callitrichids typically live in small, territorial groups of about five or six animals. Their social organization is unique among primates and is called a "cooperative polyandrous group". This communal breeding system involves groups of multiple males and females, but only one female is reproductively active. Females mate with more than one male and everyone shares the responsibility of carrying the offspring.;;;;They are the only primate group that regularly produces twins, which constitute over 80% of births in species that have been studied. Unlike other male primates, male callitrichids generally provide as much parental care as females. Parental duties may include carrying, protecting, feeding, comforting, and even engaging in play behavior with offspring. In some cases, such as in the cotton-top tamarin (''Saguinus oedipus''), males, particularly those that are paternal, will even show a greater involvement in caregiving than females.Cleveland and Snowdon. Social development during the first twenty weeks in the cotton-top tamarin ('' Saguinus o. oedipus''). Animal Behaviour (1984) vol. 32 (2) pp. 432-444 The typical social structure seems to constitute a breeding group, with several of their previous offspring living in the group and providing significant help in rearing the young.Species listImage:Tamarin portrait 2 edit3.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor tamarin (''Saguinus imperator'')*'''Family Callitrichidae'''** Genus ''Cebuella''*** Pygmy marmoset, ''Cebuella pygmaea''** Genus ''Callibella''*** Roosmalens' dwarf marmoset, ''Callibella humilis''** Genus ''Mico''*** Silvery marmoset, ''Mico argentatus''*** White marmoset, ''Mico leucippe''*** Black-tailed marmoset, ''Mico melanurus''*** Hershkovitz's marmoset, ''Mico intermedius''*** Emilia's marmoset, ''Mico emiliae''*** Black-headed marmoset, ''Mico nigriceps''*** Marca's marmoset, ''Mico marcai''*** Santarem marmoset, ''Mico humeralifer''*** Gold-and-white marmoset, ''Mico chrysoleucus''*** Maués marmoset, ''Mico mauesi''*** Satéré marmoset, ''Mico saterei''*** Manicore marmoset|Manicoré marmoset, ''Mico manicorensis''*** Rio Acarí marmoset, ''Mico acariensis''*** Rondon's marmoset, ''Mico rondoni''** Genus ''Callithrix''*** Common marmoset, ''Callithrix jacchus''*** Black-tufted marmoset, ''Callithrix penicillata''*** Wied's marmoset, ''Callithrix kuhlii''*** White-headed marmoset, ''Callithrix geoffroyi''*** Buffy-tufted marmoset, ''Callithrix aurita''*** Buffy-headed marmoset, ''Callithrix flaviceps''** Genus ''Callimico''*** Goeldi's marmoset, ''Callimico goeldii''** Genus ''Saguinus''*** Black-mantled tamarin, ''Saguinus nigricollis'';;*** Brown-mantled tamarin, ''Saguinus fuscicollis'';;*** White-mantled tamarin, ''Saguinus melanoleucus''*** Golden-mantled tamarin, ''Saguinus tripartitus''*** Moustached tamarin, ''Saguinus mystax''*** White-lipped tamarin, ''Saguinus labiatus''*** Emperor tamarin, ''Saguinus imperator''*** Red-handed tamarin, ''Saguinus midas''*** Black tamarin, ''Saguinus niger''*** Mottle-faced tamarin, ''Saguinus inustus''*** Pied tamarin, ''Saguinus bicolor''*** Martins's tamarin, ''Saguinus martinsi''*** White-footed tamarin, ''Saguinus leucopus''*** Cottontop tamarin, ''Saguinus oedipus''*** Geoffroy's tamarin, ''Saguinus geoffroyi''** Genus ''Leontopithecus''*** Golden lion tamarin, ''Leontopithecus rosalia''*** Golden-headed lion tamarin, ''Leontopithecus chrysomelas''*** Black lion tamarin, ''Leontopithecus chrysopygus''*** Superagui lion tamarin, ''Leontopithecus caissara''ReferencesCallitrichinae
