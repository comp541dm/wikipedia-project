The '''geography of Antarctica''' is dominated by its south polar location and, thus, by ice.  The Antarctic continent, located in the Earth's southern hemisphere, is centered asymmetrically around the South Pole and largely south of the Antarctic Circle.  It is surrounded by the southern waters of the World Ocean – alternatively (depending on source), it is washed by the Southern (or Antarctic) Ocean or the southern Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. It has an area of more than 14 millionkm².Some 98% of Antarctica is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, the world's largest ice sheet and also its largest reservoir of fresh water.  Averaging at least 1.6km thick, the ice is so massive that it has depressed the continental bedrock in some areas more than 2.5km below sea level; subglacial lakes of liquid water also occur (e.g., Lake Vostok).  Ice shelves and rises populate the ice sheet on the periphery.RegionsThe Princesses Astrid and Ragnhild CoastsThe Banzare, Sabrina, and Budd Law Dome CoastsPhysically, Antarctica is divided in two by Transantarctic Mountains close to the neck between the Ross Sea and the Weddell Sea. Western Antarctica and Eastern Antarctica correspond roughly to the eastern and western hemispheres relative to the Greenwich meridian. This usage has been regarded as Eurocentric by some, and the alternative terms Lesser Antarctica and Greater Antarctica (respectively) are sometimes preferred.Lesser Antarctica is covered by the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. There has been some concern about this ice sheet, because there is a small chance that it will collapse. If it does, ocean levels would rise by a few metres in a very short period of time.VolcanoesThere are four volcanoes on the mainland of Antarctica that areconsidered to be active on the basis of observed fumarolic activity or"recent" tephra deposits:Mount Melbourne (2,730 m) (74°21'S., 164°42'E.), a stratovolcano;Mount Berlin (3,500 m) (76°03'S., 135°52'W.), a stratovolcano;Mount Kauffman (2,365 m) (75°37'S., 132°25'W.), a stratovolcano; andMount Hampton (3,325 m) (76°29'S., 125°48'W.), a volcanic caldera.Several volcanoes on offshore islands have records of historic activity.Mount Erebus (3,795 m), a stratovolcano onRoss Island with 10 known eruptions and 1 suspected eruption.On the opposite side of the continent,Deception Island(62°57'S., 60°38'W.), a volcanic caldera with 10 knownand 4 suspected eruptions, have been the most active.Buckle Island in the Balleny Islands (66°50'S., 163°12'E.),Penguin Island (62°06'S., 57°54'W.),Paulet Island (63°35'S., 55°47'W.), andLindenberg Island (64°55'S., 59°40'W.) are alsoconsidered to be active.West AntarcticaWest Antarctica on the left.File:Antarctica (6), Laubeuf Fjord, Webb Island.JPG|thumb|300px|Typical landscape for the Antarctic Peninsula area, with fjords, high coastal mountains and islands.
