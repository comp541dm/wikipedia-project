Multiple games have been released for each game series, and other media based around the intellectual property for each franchise. Books have been written to expand the story for each series, along with media such as comics and collectible card games. Blizzard Entertainment announced in 2006 that they will be producing a ''Warcraft'' live-action movie. The movie is currently in development, financed and produced by Legendary Pictures, Atlas Entertainment and Film4, and will be distributed by Universal Pictures. It is scheduled to be released in 2016 and is directed by Duncan Jones.Unreleased gamesNotable unreleased titles include ''Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans'', which was cancelled on May 22, 1998, ''Shattered Nations'', and ''StarCraft: Ghost'', which was "Postponed indefinitely" on March 24, 2006 after being in development hell for much of its lifespan. After seven years of development, Blizzard revealed the cancellation of an unannounced MMO codenamed ''"Titan"'' on September 23, 2014. The company also has a history of declining to set release dates, choosing to instead take as much time as needed, generally saying a given product is "done when it's done."''Pax Imperia II'' was originally announced as a title to be published by Blizzard. Blizzard eventually dropped ''Pax Imperia II'', though, when it decided it might be in conflict with their other space strategy project, which became known as ''StarCraft''. THQ eventually contracted with Heliotrope and released the game in 1997 as ''Pax Imperia: Eminent Domain''.TechnologyWarden clientBlizzard has made use of a special form of software known as the 'Warden Client'. The Warden client is known to be used with Blizzard's Online Games such as ''Diablo'' and ''World of Warcraft'', and the Terms of Service contain a clause consenting to the Warden software's RAM scans while a Blizzard game is running.[WoW -; Legal -; Terms of Use]. Worldofwarcraft.com (December 9, 2010). Retrieved July 8, 2011.The Warden client scans a small portion of the code segment of running processes in order to determine whether any third-party programs are running. The goal of this is to detect and address players who may be attempting to run unsigned code or third party programs in the game. This determination of third party programs is made by hashing the scanned strings and comparing the hashed value to a list of hashes assumed to correspond to banned third party programs. The Warden's reliability in correctly discerning legitimate versus illegitimate actions was called into question when a large scale incident happened when many Linux users were banned after an update to Warden caused it to incorrectly detect Cedega as a cheat program.[Users Banned From World of Warcraft? | Linuxlookup].
