''aleiphar'', fat, oil) also known as non-aromatic compounds. Aliphatics can be cyclic, but only aromatic compounds contain an especially stable ring of atoms, such as benzene.  Aliphatic compounds can be saturated, like hexane, or unsaturated, like hexene. Open-chain compounds (whether straight or branched) contain no rings of any type, and are thus aliphatic.StructureAliphatic compounds can be saturated, joined by single bonds (alkanes), or unsaturated, with double bonds (alkenes) or triple bonds (alkynes). Besides hydrogen, other elements can be bound to the carbon chain, the most common being oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, and chlorine.The simplest aliphatic compound is methane (CH4). Aliphatics include alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes.PropertiesMost aliphatic compounds are flammable, allowing the use of hydrocarbons as fuel, such as methane in Bunsen burners and as liquefied natural gas (LNG), and acetylene in welding.Examples of aliphatic compounds / non-aromaticThe most important aliphatic compounds are:* n-, iso- and cyclo-alk'''an'''es (saturated hydrocarbons)* n-, iso- and cyclo-alk'''en'''es and -alk'''yn'''es (unsaturated hydrocarbons).Important examples of low-molecular aliphatic compounds can be found in the list below (sorted by the number of carbon-atoms):{| class="wikitable"|-!
