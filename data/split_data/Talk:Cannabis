User:Mlpearc|'''Mlpearc''' (User talk:Mlpearc|'''open channel''');17:18, 15 February 2016 (UTC):Looks like the edit war is over if the genus is monospecific. There is a  controversy regarding the different species and varieties of Cannabis...but what do modern sources say? Many taxonomic listings of the genus show both classifications for C. inaliea and C. ruderalis. Perhaps some history could be added here...The genus cannabis used to belong to the Nettle (Urticaceae) or Mulberry (Moraceae) family, but it has now been included along with hops (Humulus sp.) to belong to the Hemp fa (Cannabaceae).;****Jason Sawler, Jake M.

Page , Sean Myles  [The Genetic Structure of Marijuana and Hemp] Published: August 26, 2015DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0133292.:--Moxy (talk) 19:03, 15 February 2016 (UTC):Is there a content dispute? As far as I can tell all botanists agree that ''Cannabis'' is a genus. I think we have a grammar dispute. To say that ''Cannabis'' is a flowering plant sounds grammatically strange to my ears. If there was a common count noun for ''Cannabis'' plants, something like "a canave, by any other name, would smell as sweet", it would work to start the article by writing "A '''canave''' is a flowering plant of the genus ''Cannabis''". But we have no such name. Doing this with a mass noun doesn't work.--Lambiam 23:54, 15 February 2016 (UTC)::We should try to use easier to understand English at least in the leads of our article. Thus saying it is a type of plant I believe is better.

For some reason I had some suspicion that you couldn't have a monospecific genus, hence the kerfuffle. Wiktionary:genus didn't help; User:Sasata finally set me straight. So there's no content dispute. There's enough material in the references listed above by Moxy for a comprehensive section which would bring the article up to date. The lead could be finalised after that. So I think User:KrakatoaKatie should unprotectzzz (talk) 13:08, 16 February 2016 (UTC) (Edited, now in favour of keeping "genus" per comment below by Lambiam) zzz (talk) 22:00, 16 February 2016 (UTC)::::There you go. No more dumbness, guys, k? :-) Katietalk 16:17, 16 February 2016 (UTC):::The argument would be stronger if this was/would be one of only a few articles that start off with "'''''Soandso''''' is a genus of plants...". But, in fact, our articles ''Aa'' (plant), ''Acanthospermum'', ''Achlyphila'', ''Achnatherum'', ''Achudemia'', ''Acidocroton'', ''Acioa'', ''Acmella'', ''Acnistus'', ''Acrotome'', ''Acrymia'', ''Acsmithia'', ''Actinocephalus'', ''Adenocalymna'', ''Adenocline'', ''Adenopappus'', ''Afrobrunnichia'', ''Afrocalathea'', ''Aganosma'', ''Agarista'' (plant), ''Agonandra'', ''Agonis'', ''Ajugoides'', ''Albidella'', ''Algrizea'', ''Aliciella'', ''Alona'' (plant), ''Alseodaphne'', ''Alvesia'', ''Amasonia'', ''Amethystea'', ''Amorpha'', ''Amorphospermum'', ''Ampelozizyphus'', ''Amphineurion'', ''Anacyclus'', ''Ancistrachne'', ''Anemanthele'', ''Anisoptera'' (plant), ''Anredera'', ''Anthephora'', ''Anthoxanthum'', ''Anthyllis'', ''Antirrhinum'', ''Apetahia'', ''Aphelia'' (plant), ''Apluda'', ''Apoballis'', ''Apodanthera'', ''Aralidium'', ''Arctostaphylos'', ''Aremonia'', ''Argentina'' (plant), ''Argyrotegium'', ''Argythamnia'', ''Aristocapsa'', ''Asarum'', ''Aspidoglossum'', ''Asplundia'', ''Athroisma'', ''Atractylis'', ''Atraphaxis'', ''Atrichoseris'', ''Atuna'', ''Aulotandra'', ''Australopyrum'', ''Austrobuxus'', ''Austroeupatorium'', ''Axonopus'', ''Azima'', ..., ''Zea'' (genus), ''Zeugandra'', ''Zieria'', ''Zilla'' (plant), ''Zinnia'', ''Zinowiewia'', ''Zizaniopsis'', and ''Zotovia'', all start that way (or with "... is a genus in the plant family ..."). Several of these genera are also monospecific. In fact, the different phrasing in the present article might lead the attentive reader onto the garden path of thinking that there are characteristics that make plants of possibly different genera be "cannabis", like some plants are sarmentoses ("A '''sarmentose''' is a type of plant which has long slender stolons"), and others are perennials, shrubs, and so on and so forth. So I'm happy the word "genus" has (at this moment) been restored, and I hope it will remain so.--Lambiam 21:41, 16 February 2016 (UTC)
