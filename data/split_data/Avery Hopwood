Avery HopwoodFile:Avery Hopwood ; Rose Rolanda.jpg|thumb|Avery Hopwood with Spanish dancer Rose Rolanda, 1924.'''James Avery Hopwood''' (May 28, 1882 - July 1, 1928), was an American playwright, called the most successful playwright of the Jazz Age, having four plays running simultaneously on Broadway in 1920.BiographyHe was born in Cleveland, Ohio and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Michigan (1905).Hopwood started out as a journalist for a Cleveland newspaper as its New York correspondent, but within a year had a play, ''Clothes'' (1906), produced on Broadway. He became known as "The Playboy Playwright"Jim Beaver [Biography for Avery Hopwood] at Internet Movie Database and specialized in comedies and farces, some of them with material considered risqué  at the time.  One play, ''The Demi-Virgin'' in 1921, prompted a court case because of its suggestive subject matter, including a risque game of cards, "Stripping Cupid", where a bevy of showgirls teased the audience in their lingerie.  The case was dismissed.DramatistHis many plays included ''Nobody's Widow'' (1910), starring Blanche Bates; ''Fair and Warmer'' (1915), starring Madge Kennedy (filmed in 1919); ''The Gold Diggers'' (1919), starring Ina Claire (filmed in 1923 as ''The Gold Diggers'', in 1928 as ''Gold Diggers of Broadway'' and also as ''Gold Diggers of 1933''); ''Ladies' Night'', 1920, starring Charlie Ruggles (filmed in 1928); the famous mystery play ''The Bat'' (with Mary Roberts Rinehart), 1920 (filmed in 1926 ''The Bat'', 1930 ''The Bat Whispers,'' and 1959 ''The Bat)''; ''Getting Gertie's Garter'' (with Wilson Collison), 1921, starring Hazel Dawn (filmed in 1927 and 1945); ''The Demi-Virgin'', 1921, also starring Dawn; ''The Alarm Clock'', 1923; ''The Best People'' (with David Gray), 1924 (filmed in 1925 and as ''Fast and Loose'' in 1930), the song-farce ''Naughty Cinderella'', 1925, starring Irene Bordoni and ''The Garden of Eden'' in 1927 (filmed in 1928 as ''The Garden of Eden'').Hopwood was asked to write the third act of Mary Roberts Rinehart's play; ''The Bat''. Hopwood collaborated with Rinehart to then work on the last act of the play in Sewickley and sometimes in New York."University of Pittsburgh press"Interestingly, the early sound film, ''The Bat Whispers'', played an influence on Bob Kane's Batman because the inspiration for Batman's costume came from the "mysterious Bat" character portrayed in the movie from 1930.A clever, adroit, masterful craftsman who wrote to the tastes of his public, Hopwood was inexhaustible in his work ethic.  Although the press reported that he was engaged to vaudeville dancer and choreographer Rose Rolanda in 1924, Hopwood's close friend Carl Van Vechten confirmed in later years that it was all a publicity stunt.  Rolanda would later marry caricaturist Miguel Covarrubias.DeathWhile swimming at Juan-les-Pins on the French Riviera, July 1, 1928, he suffered a heart attack and died. He is buried in Riverside Cemetery, Cleveland, Ohio, next to his mother, Jule.Vigil, Vicki Blum (2007). ''Cemeteries of Northeast Ohio: Stones, Symbols ; Stories''.

The novel was published in July 2011 as ''The Great Bordello''.ReferencesImage:Hopwood.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.7|WPA poster for ''The Alarm Clock'' by Avery HopwoodFurther reading*''Avery Hopwood: His Life and Plays'', by Jack F.
