The Country CodeFile:Oceania without Asian country codes.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Map of Oceania with country codes.'''Country Codes''' are short alphabetic or numeric geographical codes (geocodes) developed to represent countries and dependent areas, for use in data processing and communications. Several different systems have been developed to do this. The best known of these is ISO 3166-1. The term ''country code'' frequently refers to international dialing codes, the E.164 country calling codes.ISO 3166-1ISO 3166-1This standard defines for most of the countries and dependent areas in the world:*a two-letter (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2)*a three-letter (ISO 3166-1 alpha-3), and*a three-digit numeric (ISO 3166-1 numeric) code.The two-letter codes are used as the basis for some other codes or applications, for example,*for ISO 4217 currency codes and*with deviations, for country code top-level domain names (ccTLDs) on the Internet: list of Internet TLDs.For more applications see ISO 3166-1 alpha-2.Other country codes*European Union:**Before the 2004 EU enlargement the EU used the UN Road Traffic Conventions license plate codes; since then, it uses ISO 3166-1**The ''Nomenclature des unités territoriales statistiques'' (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics, NUTS) of the European Union, mostly focusing on subdivisions of the EU member states*FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) assigns a three-letter code (dubbed FIFA Trigramme) to each of its member and non-member countries: List of FIFA country codes*Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4 defined two-letter codes used by the U.S. government and in the CIA World Factbook: list of FIPS country codes.
