Zen Clark (talk) 00:24, 3 November 2008 (UTC)Older discussionAm not sure why this was entered under "Berkeley_System_Distribution"but the NetBSD documentation [1]has the S standing for Software, and that seems to be thepredominate usage (even in the article itself, leading to the odd situationin which the article and article title don't match).  --JoeAnderson-----In the early days it was called "Berkeley Source Distribution".

This ultimately resulted in an evolving system known as BSD (Berkeley Standard Distribution).;/blockquote;It goes on to mention enhancements such as the TCP/IP stack and then licensing issues with AT;T.The file is also available under ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/doc/: [This book] and [this book] both have it as  "Berkeley ''Software'' Distribution" and don't mention other variations.

These options did not come from POSIX, they came from XPG3, and in any case I don't believe any of the BSD's have ever made it a goal to implement the XSI option (which mostly memorializes mistakes from System V that Berkeley had the good sense not to copy).  These options were not included in the mandatory part of the standard specifically because there was and is no consensus on making them mandatory.  All of the command-line options about which you complain are part of XSI, except for "-o" which is implemented to specification.:::In any case, the 4.4BSD library and most of the userland tools were quite definitely written to the 1003.1-1990 standard and to drafts of the (then still in development) 1003.2 effort.  18.26.0.18 06:33, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)The article could say "the BSD operating systems might someday be notable for their standards conformance", but it seemed more polite to just quietly delete that section.

SysV wasn't on the roadmap in 1981.  Who is claiming this?I've never heard that about 4.1, but I have heard that was a reason with 4.2 (however, I can't track down a solid ref).  However, Don Libes' "Life with UNIX" says on pg. 18 says 4.2 was originally slated to be 5 BSD, but they would have had to relicense it with AT;T according to university rules.--Agarvin 23:25, 16 October 2006 (UTC)System V was concurrent with BSD 4.1 and 4.2.

Does anyone have some evidence for this or know where the VM code came from?I do know for a fact that UC Berkeley did plagiarize some code.  The program vroff (troff for the Versetac printer) was written at the University of Toronto.
