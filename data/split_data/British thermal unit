BTUThe '''British thermal unit''' ('''BTU''' or '''Btu''') is a traditional unit of work equal to about 1055 joules. It is the amount of work needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit (Physical analogue: one four-inch wooden kitchen match consumed completely generates approximately 1 BTU). In science, the joule, the SI unit of energy, has largely replaced the BTU.The BTU/h is most often used as a measure of power in the power, steam generation, heating, and air conditioning industries. It is still used in some metric English-speaking countries (such as Canada, but notably not the United Kingdom). In North America, the heat value (energy content) of fuels is expressed in BTUs.The notation '''kBtu''' or '''KBTU''' is often used for thousand BTU, in sizing of heating systems and in the Energy Use Index (EUI) expressed as thousand BTU annual energy use per square foot of building.  '''MBTU''' represents one million Btu, although the atypical notation '''MMBtu''' or '''mmBtu''' is sometimes used to represent one million BTU.(see definitions below)DefinitionsA BTU is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 avoirdupois pound of liquid water by 1 degree Fahrenheit at a constant pressure of one atmosphere. As with the calorie, several definitions of the BTU exist, because the temperature response of water to heat energy is non-linear. This means that the change in temperature of a water mass caused by adding a certain amount of heat to it will be a function of the water's initial temperature. Definitions of the BTU based on different water temperatures can therefore vary by up to 0.5%.{| class=wikitable|-! style="width:100px;"| Nominal temperature!! style="width:140px;"| BTU equivalent in joules !!

This notation is easily confused with the SI ''mega- (M)'' prefix, which denotes multiplication by a factor of one million (×106), or with the SI ''milli- (m)'' prefix, which denotes division by a factor of one thousand (×10−3).To avoid confusion, some companies and engineers use the notation "MMBtu" or "mmBtu" to represent one million BTU (although, confusingly, MM in Roman numerals would traditionally represent 2,000) and in many contexts this form of notation is deprecated and discouraged in favour of the more modern SI prefixes. Alternatively, the term ''therm'' may be used to represent 100,000 (or 105)BTU, and ''quad'' for 1015BTU. Some companies also use 'BtuE6' in order to reduce confusion between 103BTU and 106BTU.ConversionsOne BTU is approximately:* 1.054 to 1.060 kJ (kilojoules)* 0.293071 W·h (watt hours)* 252 to 253cal (calories, or "little calories")* 0.25 kcal (kilocalories, "large calories", or "food calories")* 25,031 to 25,160ft·pdl (foot-poundal)* 778 to 782ft·lbf (foot-pounds-force)* 5.40395 (lbf/in2)·ft3A BTU can be approximated as the heat produced by burning a single wooden kitchen match or as the amount of energy it takes to lift a one-pound weight 0.For natural gas* In natural gas, by convention 1MMBtu (1 million BTU) = 1.054615GJ.* The energy content (high or low heating value) of a volume of natural gas varies with the composition of the natural gas, which means there is no universal conversion factor for the number of BTU to volume. 1 standard cubic foot of average natural gas yields ≈ 1030BTU (between 1010BTU and 1070BTU, depending on quality, when burned)* As a coarse approximation, 1000ft3 of natural gas yields ≈ 1MMBTU ≈ 1GJ* 1ft3 of natural gas yields ≈ 1000 BTU* For natural gas price conversion 1000m3 ≈ 36.906MMBTU and 1MMBTU ≈ 27.096m3As a unit of powerWhen used as a unit of power for heating and cooling systems, BTU ''per hour'' (BTU/h) is the correct unit, though this is often abbreviated to just "BTU".* 1 watt is approximately 3.41214BTU/h[;;2009 ASHRAE Handbook – Fundamentals (I-P Edition)].

It is the amount of power needed to freeze 3 of water into ice in 24 hours.* 1 ''therm'' is defined in the United States and European Union as 100,000BTU—but the U.S. uses the BTU59°F while the EU uses the BTUIT. The therm is used to price natural gas.* 1 ''quad'' (short for quadrillion BTU) is 1015BTU, which is about one exajoule (). Quads are used in the United States for representing the annual energy consumption of large economies: for example, the U.S. economy used 99.75 quads in 2005. One quad/year is about 33.43 gigawatts.The BTU should not be confused with the Board of Trade Unit (B.O.T.U.), which is a much larger quantity of energy ().The BTU is often used to express the conversion-efficiency of heat into electrical energy in power plants. Figures are quoted in terms of the quantity of heat in BTU required to generate 1kW·h of electrical energy. A typical coal-fired power plant works at 10,500BTU/kW·h, an efficiency of 32–33%.See also*Conversion of units*Latent heat*Metrication*Ton of refrigerationReferences30emExternal links
