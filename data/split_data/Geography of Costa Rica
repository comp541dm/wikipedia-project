Political map of Costa Rica.Shaded relief map of Costa Rica.Map of Costa Rica.Topography of Costa Rica'''Costa Rica''' is located on the Central American Isthmus, surrounding the point 10° north of the equator and 84° west of the prime meridian. It borders both the Caribbean Sea (to the east) and the North Pacific Ocean (to the west), with a total of 1,290km of coastline (212km on the Caribbean coast and 1,016km on the Pacific).Costa Rica shares a border with Nicaragua to the north (313km long border) and with Panama to the south (348km long border). The area of Costa Rica is 51,100km² of which 51,060km² is land and 40km² is water, making it slightly smaller than the U.S. state of West Virginia...Physical geographyFile:Localisation de l'ile de Clipperton.png|right|thumbnail|Extent of Costa Rica's western EEZ in the PacificThe nation's terrain is a coastal plain separated by rugged mountains, the Cordillera Central and the Cordillera de Talamanca, which form the spine of the country and separate the Pacific and Caribbean watersheds.  Costa Rica claims an exclusive economic zone of  and a territorial sea of 1.The spine of the country produces many major river systems.  Rivers draining into the Caribbean include:* Colorado River (''Rio Colorado'')* Pacuare River (''Rio Pacuare'')* Reventazón River (''Rio Parismina'')* Reventazón River (''Rio Reventazon'')* Sixaola River (''Rio Sixaola'')Rivers draining into the Lake Nicaragua or the San Juan River (''Rio San Juan''), whose waters eventually drains into the Caribbean, include:* Sapoá River (''Rio Sapoá'')* Frío River (''Rio Frío'')* San Carlos River (''Rio San Carlos'')* Sarapiquí River (''Rio Sarapiquí'')Rivers draining into the Pacific Ocean include:* Abangares River (''Rio Abangares'')* Guacimal River (''Rio Guacimal'')* Sierpe River (''Rio Sierpe'')* Tempisque River (''Rio Tempisque'')* Térraba River (''Rio Terraba'')In the eastern half of the country, the San Juan River forms the northern border with Nicaragua.Mountain rangesCordillera de TilaránThe Tilaran Range is part of the Continental Divide east of Lake Arenal and the nearby active volcano Arenal, and running into the Cordillera Central range further east.  It is located in the Abangares district of the province of Guanacaste.At the edge of the range is the Monteverde cloud forest preserve, a major ecotourism destination.Cordillera CentroThe Central Range continues the Continental Divide east of Cordillera de Tilarán. It has four large volcanoes: Poás Volcano|Poás, Barva, Irazú Volcano|Irazú and Turrialba. The highest peak is Irazú at 3,432 m.Cordillera de GuanacasteThe Guanacaste Range is in northern Costa Rica near the border with Nicaragua. The range forms part of the southern region of the Continental Divide, the highest peak being the extinct stratovolcano Miravalles at 2,028 m.  Peaks include:* Tenorio Volcano (1,913 m)* Miravalles Volcano (2,028 m)* Orosí Volcano (1,659 m)* Rincón de la Vieja Volcano (1,916 m)*Arenal Volcano (1,670)Cordillera de TalamancaMuch of the Talamanca Range is included in the La Amistad International Park, which is shared between Costa Rica and Panama. The country's highest peaks lie in this mountain range: the Cerro Chirripó and the Cerro Kamuk. Much of the region is covered by the forest.Cerros de EscazúThe Cerros de Escazú borders the Central Valley to the south and is considered the northernmost portion of the Cordillera de Talamanca.ClimateCosta Rica has a tropical and subtropical climate and is part of the Neotropic ecozone. It is part of many ecoregions, including Costa Rican seasonal moist forests, Bocas del Toro-San Bastimentos Island-San Blas mangroves, Mosquitia-Nicaraguan Caribbean Coast mangroves, Southern Dry Pacific Coast mangroves, Central American dry forests, and Talamancan montane forests. An inlet from the Pacific the Gulf of Nicoya contains several small islands, the largest of these being Chira Island with a population of around four thousand.Costa Rica's dry season in most places is from December to April, while the rainy season is from May to November. On the Caribbean coast, however, December is by far the wettest month. The highlands areas are always cooler. The lowest elevation levels in the country are on the western and eastern coasts, at sea level. The highest point is Cerro Chirripó, a volcanic mountain with an elevation of  (part of Chirripó National Park). On a clear day, it is possible to see both the Caribbean and the Pacific from the peak.EcologyWildlife of Costa RicaImage:Rainforest at Puentes Colgantes.jpg|right|thumb|Rainforest in Costa RicaLike all Central American countries, Costa Rica is considered part of a biodiversity hotspot. According to the INBio, about 4.5% of the world's biodiversity can be found in Costa Rica.Costa Rica is home to about 12,119 species of plants, of which 950 are endemic.[Costa Rica Forest Information and Data]. rainforests.mongabay.com There are 117 native trees and more than 1,400 types of orchids, a third of them can be found in the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve.. Monteverdeinfo.com. Retrieved on 2012-01-28. Almost a half of the country's land is covered by forests, though only 3.5% is covered by primary forests."rainforests.mongabay.com"Deforestation is a devastating process, with more than 8,100 ha of forest being lost annually. The main reason for such high deforestation levels is to make plains for cattle ranching.Wildlife diversity is very high; there are 441 species of amphibians and reptiles, 838 species of birds, 232 species of mammals and 181 species of fresh water fish. Costa Rica has high levels of endemism; 81 species of amphibians and reptiles, 17 species of birds and 7 species of mammals are endemic to the country. However, many species are endangered. According to the World Conservation Monitoring Centre, 209 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians and plants are endangered.. Unep-Wcmc. Retrieved on 2012-01-28. Some of the country's most endangered species are the Harpy eagle, the Giant anteater, the Golden toad and the Jaguar. IUCN reports the Golden toad as extinct.Incilius periglenes IUCN Red List's article about the Golden toadProtected areasList of Conservation Areas of Costa RicaThe country is noted for its national park system, administered by SINAC (''Sistema Nacional de Areas de Conservacion'', or "National System of Conservation Areas"). This agency oversees the 26 national park, and more than 160 protected areas in Costa Rica.  The other types of protected areas in Costa Rica are National Wildlife Refuges, Biological Reserves, Protection Zones, and Absolute Nature Reserves.  Together the protected areas comprise over one-fourth of Costa Rican territory. 9.3% of the country is protected under IUCN categories I-V.Tortuguero National ParkThe creation of the Tortuguero National Park in 1970 gave much needed protection to one of the region's most important and unique natural resources: a 22km stretch of shoreline that serves as the principal nesting site for sea turtles.Environmental issuesEnvironmental issues include deforestation, largely a result of the clearing of land for cattle ranching; soil erosion; coastal marine pollution; fisheries protection; solid waste management; and air pollution.DeforestationDeforestation in Costa RicaBare land in Guanacaste Conservation Area.Deforestation in Costa Rica has a serious impact upon the environment. Since the end of World War II, approximately 80% of the forests of Costa Rica have disappeared. Approximately ha of land are deforested annually; in the 1990s the country had one of the worst deforestation rates in Central America.As the population grew, the people of Costa Rica cut down the forests to provide for pastureland for cattle ranching to produce beef for the world market to raise revenue. Since the 1950s, approximately 60% of Costa Rica has been cleared to make room for cattle ranching.VivaOver half of Costa Rica's existing forest cover today is under the protection of national parks, biological reserves, or wildlife refuges. A major problem in regards to deforestation is the privately owned plots which occupy the other half of the forested land.VivaLenient laws on land and amendments to forestry law makes it easy to obtain logging concessions as owners exploit the land to maximise income.VivaEnvironmental treatiesCosta Rica is party to many environmental treaties, including the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Convention on Environmental Modification, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Montreal Protocol, the Ramsar Convention, the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, the Desertification Convention, the Endangered Species Convention, the Basel Convention, the Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Convention on Marine Dumping, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It has signed but not ratified the Convention on Marine Life Conservation and the Kyoto Protocol.GeographyFile:Costa Rica map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Costa Rica map of Köppen climate classification.Area:Total: 51,100 sq km:Land: 50,660 sq km:Water: 440 sq kmLand boundaries:Total: 661 km:Border countries: Nicaragua 313 km, Panama 348 kmCoastline:1,290 kmMaritime claims:Territorial sea::Exclusive Economic Zone::Continental shelf:Climate:Tropical and subtropical; dry season (December to April); rainy season (May to November); cooler in highlands.
