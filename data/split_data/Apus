Its name means "no feet" in Greek, and it represents a bird-of-paradise (which were once believed to lack feet).  Its genitive is "Apodis".HistoryApus was one of twelve constellations created by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman.  It first appeared on a 35cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 or 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius."ridpath"Plancius called the constellation ''Paradysvogel Apis Indica''; the first word is Dutch for "bird of paradise", of genus Pteridophora, but the others are Latin for "Indian Bee". ''Apis'' (Latin for "bee") is presumably an error for ''avis'' ("bird")."UT"The name ''Apus'' is derived from the Greek ''apous'', meaning "without feet".  This referred to the Western misconception that the bird-of-paradise had no feet, which arose because the only specimens available in the West had their feet and wings removed."ridpath"Such specimens began to arrive in Europe in 1522, when the survivors of Ferdinand Magellan's expedition brought them home.After its introduction on Plancius's globe, the constellation's first known appearance in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer's ''Uranometria'' of 1603, where it was called "Apis Indica"."ridpath""UT"Richard Allen reports Semler's assertion that de Houtman, who observed the southern constellations from the island of Sumatra, took his ideas for the formation of Apus (as well as Phoenix and Indus) from the Chinese, who knew the stars of Apus as the "Little Wonder Bird",Richard H. Allen (1899) Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning, p. 45 ;and that Semler's assertion was disputed by Ideler (though Ideler acknowledged the Chinese constellations).CharacteristicsCovering 206.3 square degrees and hence 0.500% of the sky, Antlia ranks 67th of the 88 modern constellations by area. Its position in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere means that the whole constellation is visible to observers south of 7°N.tirionconstIt is bordered by Ara, Triangulum Australe and Circinus to the north, Musca and Chamaeleon to the west, Octans to the south, and Pavo to the east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is 'Aps'. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of six segments (''illustrated in infobox''). In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 49.5 and 27.3, while the declination coordinates are between -67.48° and -83.12°."boundary"Notable featuresThe constellation Apus as it can be seen by the naked eye.The most prominent deep-sky objects in Apus include the globular clusters NGC 6101 and IC 4499 as well as the spiral galaxy IC 4633.List of stars in ApusStarsWithin the constellation's borders, there are 39 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude6.5.tirionconstAlpha Apodis is an orange giant 411 light years away, with a magnitude of 3.8."UT"Beta Apodis is an orange giant 158 light years away, with a magnitude of 4.2.
