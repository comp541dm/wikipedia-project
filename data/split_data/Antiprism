Antiprisms are a subclass of the prismatoids.Antiprisms are similar to prisms except the bases are twisted relative to each other, and that the side faces are triangles, rather than quadrilaterals.In the case of a regular ''n''-sided base, one usually considers the case where its copy is twisted by an angle 180°/''n''. Extra regularity is obtained by the line connecting the base centers being perpendicular to the base planes, making it a '''right antiprism'''. As faces, it has the two ''n''-gonal bases and, connecting those bases, 2''n'' isosceles triangles.Uniform antiprismA '''uniform antiprism''' has, apart from the base faces, 2''n'' equilateral triangles as faces. As a class, the uniform antiprisms form an infinite series of vertex-uniform polyhedra, as do the uniform prisms. For  we have as degenerate case the regular tetrahedron as a ''digonal antiprism'', and for  the non-degenerate regular octahedron as a ''triangular antiprism''.The dual polyhedra of the antiprisms are the trapezohedra. Their existence was first discussed and their name was coined by Johannes Kepler.Schlegel diagrams{| class=wikitable|- align=center|100pxA3|100pxA4|100pxA5|100pxA6|100pxA7|100pxA8|}Cartesian coordinatesCartesian coordinates for the vertices of a right antiprism with ''n''-gonal bases and isosceles triangles are:\left( \cos\frac{k\pi}{n}, \sin\frac{k\pi}{n}, (-1)^k h \right)with ''k'' ranging from 0 to 2''n''−1; if the triangles are equilateral,:2h^2=\cos\frac{\pi}{n}-\cos\frac{2\pi}{n}.Volume and surface areaLet ''a'' be the edge-length of a uniform antiprism. Then the volume is:V = \frac{n \sqrt{4\cos^2\frac{\pi}{2n}-1}\sin \frac{3\pi}{2n} }{12\sin^2\frac{\pi}{n}} \; a^3and the surface area is:A = \frac{n}{2} ( \cot{\frac{\pi}{n}} + \sqrt{3}) a^2.Related polyhedraThere are an infinite set of truncated antiprisms, including a lower-symmetry form of the truncated octahedron (truncated triangular antiprism). These can be alternated to create snub antiprisms, two of which are Johnson solids, and the ''snub triangular antiprism'' is a lower symmetry form of the icosahedron.{| class=wikitable|-!colspan=5|Antiprisms|- align=center|70px|80px|80px|80px|...|- align=center|disphenoid|s{2,4}|octahedron|s{2,6}|square antiprism|s{2,8}|pentagonal antiprism|s{2,10}|s{2,2''n''}|-!colspan=5|Truncated antiprisms|-!80px|80px|80px|80px|...|- align=center|valign=bottom|ts{2,4}|truncated octahedron|ts{2,6}|ts{2,8}|ts{2,10}|ts{2,2n}|-!colspan=5|Snub antiprisms|-!J84!Icosahedron!J85!colspan=2|Irregular...|- align=center|50px|80px|80px|80px|...|- align=center|Snub disphenoid|ss{2,4}|Regular icosahedron|ss{2,6}|snub square antiprism|ss{2,8}|ss{2,10}|Snub antiprism|ss{2,2n}|}SymmetryThe symmetry group of a right ''n''-sided antiprism with regular base and isosceles side faces is D''n''d of order 4''n'', except in the case of a tetrahedron, which has the larger symmetry group Td of order 24, which has three versions of D2d as subgroups, and the octahedron, which has the larger symmetry group Oh of order 48, which has four versions of D3d as subgroups.The symmetry group contains inversion if and only if ''n'' is odd.The rotation group is D''n'' of order 2''n'', except in the case of a tetrahedron, which has the larger rotation group T of order 12, which has three versions of D2 as subgroups, and the octahedron, which has the larger rotation group O of order 24, which has four versions of D3 as subgroups.Star antiprism{| class=wikitable align=right width=320|- align=center|colspan=3|160px5/2-antiprism|colspan=3|160px5/3-antiprism|- align=center|colspan=2|120px9/2-antiprism|colspan=2|120px9/4-antiprism|colspan=2|120px9/5-antiprism|}This shows all the non-star and star antiprisms up to 15 sides - together with those of a 29-gon.Uniform star antiprisms are named by their star polygon bases, {p/q}, and exist in prograde and retrograde (crossed) solutions. Crossed forms have intersecting vertex figures, and are denoted by inverted fractions, p/(p-q) instead of p/q, like 5/3 versus 5/2.In the retrograde forms but not in the prograde forms, the triangles joining the star bases intersect the axis of rotational symmetry.Some retrograde star antiprisms with regular star polygon bases cannot be constructed with equal edge lengths, so are not uniform polyhedra. Star antiprism compounds also can be constructed where p and q have common factors; thus a 10/4 antiprism is the compound of two 5/2 star antiprisms.{| class="wikitable"|+ Uniform star antiprisms by symmetry, up to 12!Symmetry group!colspan=4|Star forms|-!align=center| d5h[2,5](*225)| 64pxPentagrammic antiprism|3.3.3.5/2|-!align=center| d5d[2+,5](2*5)| 64pxPentagrammic crossed-antiprism|3.3.3.5/3|-!align=center| d7h[2,7](*227)| 64pxHeptagrammic antiprism (7/2)|3.3.3.7/2| 64pxHeptagrammic crossed-antiprism|3.3.3.7/4|-!align=center| d7d[2+,7](2*7)| 64pxHeptagrammic antiprism (7/3)|3.3.3.7/3|-!align=center| d8d[2+,8](2*8)| 64pxOctagrammic antiprism|3.3.3.8/3| 64pxOctagrammic crossed-antiprism|3.3.3.8/5|-!align=center| d9h[2,9](*229)| 64pxEnneagrammic antiprism (9/2)|3.3.3.9/2| 64pxEnneagrammic antiprism (9/4)|3.3.3.9/4|-!align=center| d9d[2+,9](2*9)| 64pxEnneagrammic crossed-antiprism|3.3.3.9/5|-!align=center| d10d[2+,10](2*10)| 64pxDecagrammic antiprism|3.3.3.10/3|-!align=center| d11h[2,11](*2.2.11)| 64px3.3.3.11/2| 64px3.3.3.11/4| 64px3.3.3.11/6|-!align=center| d11d[2+,11](2*11)| 64px3.3.3.11/3| 64px3.3.3.11/5| 64px3.3.3.11/7|-!align=center| d12d[2+,12](2*12)| 64pxDodecagrammic antiprism|3.3.3.12/5| 64pxDodecagrammic crossed-antiprism|3.3.3.12/7|-| ...|}*Prism*Apeirogonal antiprism*Grand antiprism – a four-dimensional polytope*One World Trade Center, a building consisting primarily of an elongated square antiprismReferences*  Chapter 2: Archimedean polyhedra, prisma and antiprismsExternal linksAntiprisms******[Paper models of prisms and antiprisms]up
