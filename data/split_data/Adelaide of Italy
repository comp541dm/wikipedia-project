Empress Adelaide was perhaps the most prominent European woman of the 10th century; she was regent of the Holy Roman Empire as the guardian of her grandson in 991-995."ce"LifeBorn in Orbe Castle, Orbe, Kingdom of Upper Burgundy (now in modern-day Switzerland), she was the daughter of Rudolf II of Burgundy, a member of the Elder House of Welf, and Bertha of Swabia. Her first marriage, at the age of fifteen, was to the son of her father's rival in Italy, Lothair II, the nominal King of Italy; the union was part of a political settlement designed to conclude a peace between her father and Hugh of Provence, the father of Lothair. Their daughter, Emma of Italy, was born about 948.Marriage to Otto IImage:Meissner-dom-stifter.jpg|thumb|left|Adelaide and her second spouse OttoIThe Calendar of Saints states that her first husband was poisoned by the holder of real power, his successor, Berengar of Ivrea, who attempted to cement his political power by forcing her to marry his son, Adalbert; when she refused and fled, she was tracked down and imprisoned for four months at Como.According to Adelaide's contemporary biographer, Odilo of Cluny, she managed to escape from captivity. After a time spent in the marshes nearby, she was rescued and taken to a "certain impregnable fortress," likely the fortified town of Canossa near Reggio. She managed to send an emissary to Otto I, and asked the East Frankish king for his protection. The widow met Otto at the old Lombard capital of Pavia and they married in 951.''Burgundy and Provence, 879–1032'', Constance Brittain Bouchard,'''The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume 3, C.900-c.1024''', 342. Pope JohnXII crowned Otto Holy Roman Emperor in Rome on February 2, 962, and, breaking tradition, also crowned Adelaide as Holy Roman Empress.''The Ottonians as kings and emperors'', Eckhard Müller-Mertens, '''The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume 3, C.900-c.1024''', 251.In Germany, the crushing of a revolt in 953 by Liudolf, Otto's son by his first marriage, cemented Adelaide's position, for she retained all her dower lands. She and their eleven-year-old son, the crown prince who became Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|OttoII, accompanied Otto in 966 on his third expedition to Italy, where Otto restored the newly elected Pope John XIII to his throne (and executed some of the Roman rioters who had deposed him). Adelaide remained in Rome for six years while Otto ruled his kingdom from Italy. Their son Otto II was crowned co-emperor in 967, then married the Byzantine princess Theophanu in April 972, resolving the conflict between the two empires in southern Italy, as well as ensuring the imperial succession. Adelaide and her husband then returned to Germany, where Otto died in May 973, at the same Memleben palace where his father had died 37 years earlier.RetirementAdelaide had long entertained close relations with Cluny, then the center of the movement for ecclesiastical reform, and in particular with its abbots Majolus and Odilo. She retired to a nunnery she had founded in c.991 at Selz in Alsace."". Saints.SQPN.com. 15 June 2012. Web. {2012-9-20}. Though she never became a nun, she spent the rest of her days there in prayer. On her way to Burgundy to support her nephew Rudolph III of Burgundy|RudolfIII against a rebellion, she died at Selz Abbey on December16, 999, days short of the millennium she thought would bring the Second Coming of Christ. She had constantly devoted herself to the service of the church and peace, and to the empire as guardian of both; she also interested herself in the conversion of the Slavs. She was thus a principal agent;mdash;almost an embodiment;mdash;of the work of the pre-schism Orthodox Catholic Church at the end of the Early Middle Ages in the construction of the religious culture of Central Europe.Some of her relics are preserved in a shrine in Hanover. Her feast day, December 16, is still kept in many German dioceses.IssueIn 947, Adelaide was married to King Lothair II of Italy."Holböck126";Ferdinand Holböck, ''Married Saints and Blesseds: Through the Centuries'', transl.
