Boeing Red BarnI was recently on a tour at the Museum of Flight near seattle WA.  I got a picture of a red barn they said was the first boeing factory.  Is there a reason this is not mentioned in the article?  Does anybody who maintains this article think a picture of this barn would be useful?  Thanks.

You should upload it and add it to this article.

This does track with popular nomenclature, but can be quite confusing, even to people who have worked for Boeing for a long time.Boeing model 299 was the U.S. Army B-17.  Noting that the 299 came before the 307 isw significant, since the 307 was developed using the 299's wing and major systems.  This relationship is correctly noted for the 345 (B-29) and the 377 Stratocruiser.It was the 707 that led to a commercial airplane marketing notion of mdoel numbers as something other than just the sequention number assigned by engineering.  Engineering used many variations on the model designations, most of which were ignored by marketing.  This led to considerable embarrassment with the MD-95 (really as DC-9 Model 95) was renamed the supposedly skipped 717.  The 717 had actually been the engineering model designation for the KC-135 series of tankers and related "EC" planes.  When this was pointed out to marketing, they quickly dubbed the MD-95 the 717-200, but I'm pretty sure that this was the first model designation totally invented by markeing.Boeing's practice since the 1930's has been to use a 3+3 model number.  The first three digits are the master drawing number, including the feature variations.  The first digit of the second three designates the major derivative series, and the second and third digits indicate the intial operator or customer (lots of variation here with leased planes, and planes that are subleased or resold before delivery).  So from an engineering model designation point of view, the numbering system has not changed with the 747-800 and the 787-300, -800 and -900.  Internal drawing references use the same 3+3 system that has been in place for over 60 years.  However, marketing decided to drop the second two digits and adopt the Douglas one and two digit sub-model designation, which is they way Boeing did it during the 1920's and 1930's.  In fact, the 707 was developed using the deliberately misleading 367-80 designation to suggest that it was a multi-engined turbo-prop, which is what the 300 series models were.There have been some notable departures.  For example, the subsidized Boeing SST was designated model 2707-100.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Enkidofriend (talk • Special:Contributions/Enkidofriend|contribs) 04:04, 27 April 2009 (UTC);;; ;;: The 300 series aren't turboprops; Boeing NEVER, EVER built a turboprop plane. Therefore, the 300s aren't turboprops. --Compdude123 (talk) 01:36, 6 November 2010 (UTC)Concept aircraft*367-80 Stratoliner Prototype, N70700, MASDC, November 12, 1973*EC-137D Airborne Warning and Control System Prototype, 71-1408, Boeing Field, Seattle, June 18, 1973*727-63 General Electric Unducted Fan Testbed, N32720, Mojave Airport, November 9, 1986*747-121 General Electric Engine Testbed, N747GE, Kramer Junction, California, August 24, 1999* 1 737-900 Prototype, N737X, Edwards Air Force Base, November 2, 2000 NT-43A Radar Test Bed, 73-1155, Death Valley, January 24, 2003* 1 767-200 Airborne Surveillance Testbed, N767BA, Southern California Air Logistics Center, Victorville, June 17, 2005* 1 757-200 F-22 Avionics Testbed, N757A, Air Force Plant 42, Palmdale, California, February 13, 2006*747-273C Evergreen International Supertanker, N470EV, San Bernardino, May 31, 2006*720-051B Honeywell engine testbed N720H, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, December 27, 2007*757-225 Honeywell engine testbed N757HW, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, February 1, 2010* 4 787-8 Prototype N7874, Mesa Gateway Airport, Arizona, May 23, 2010:Source:  ....

Something is either American or not American, and it is either multinational or not multinational.In reality, The Boeing Company is incorporated in the United States of America, it is taxed by the United States Government and its state governments. The Boeing Company is American, notwithstanding that it might have some subsidiaries of cooperating corporations in other countries.Special:Contributions/98.81.11.27|98.81.11.27 (talk) 00:29, 18 July 2012 (UTC):1) Boeing has always been defined as a multinational corporation for a long time since they deal with contracts that are abroad and enforced under WTO rules and they are based ; headquartered here in the United States.  There's a lot of google search terms for this so the label is properly applied.  There's even a wiki article on this List of multinational corporations.  2) I've reverted a lot of the changes you've made.  For example, there is no "Warplane ; helicopter" nor is there "civil aviation" market in any trade market whatsoever but rather it's under Aerospace and/or Defense ie:  3) The stuff about the Saturn V Stage S-IC?  Boeing won the contract to build that SPECIFIC stage while others had responsibilities of different parts of the rocket.

It is true and correct that The Boeing Company is an American multinational, however that wording is confusing and needed revision. It is not the facts that are at issue here, it is the way the facts are presented. I revised the article to describe Boeing as a "United States-based multinational".

Worse, we're treating WP as a news site, including information that changes constantly and needs frequent updating. If re-creating tables that are already published on Boeing's website is the best we can do, then we need to remove the tables from the article and simply list the link to [Boeing's Employment Numbers webpage] in the "External links" section, assuming we agree that is worthy of inclusion at all. It is unwise to include information that is only correct at a particular point in time, changes regularly and needs constant updating. Again, WP is not a news site and it is not a collection of indiscriminate facts without context.A prose section that discusses the ebbs and flows of Boeing's workforce size in relation to events over the course of time would be encyclopedic. A better written section would answer questions like: How quickly did the size of Boeing's workforce grow over the company's first decades? How much did employment increase due to wars? How much did it contract at wars' ends? How much and at what times did employment expand and contract due to economic downturns and upturns? Other ideas include comparing the number of employees in BCA to the number in Defense and relating that to revenue per employee in each division. Facts in context are encyclopedic; random tables are not.The '''Employment numbers''' section needs to go or be replaced by encyclopedic prose.

Does anyone know anything about this part of Boeing's history?

SellarsPDN Maritime Columnist"Tad Roberts says:August 23, 2011 at 3:09 pmCarl,It seems Boeing Aircraft of Canada existed from the end of 1928 until 1937. They built quite a few boats, many of them commercial fishing seiners(approx. 75′-85′), I find a dozen Boeing built boats in the current Canadian Ships Registry. The largest was Taconite, the 125′ Tom Halliday designed Boeing family yacht launched in 1930. She was the summer home of Mrs. Bertha Boeing from the 30′s until her death in 1977, and she was always moored in Vancouver. Apparently Boeing had at some point been involved in a taconite mine….perhaps that’s were the (reported) $400,000 (1930) dollars to build her came from….Deerleap II (85′ motoryacht) is another well known product of the Boeing yard. Antiques Afloat reports that the yard built a 130′ car ferry in 1931 (depression years) for the city of North Vancouver. Also in 1928-31 they built 3 stock 48′ triple-cabin cruisers with cedar hulls, yellow cedar decking, and teak cabins with Hall-Scott engines."A 62′ Boeing….
