I added 'are said to'.  Who says, by the way?  There are many different dream traditions. --MichaelTinklerThese are great photos and a very clear demonstration of what the stone looks like in different conditions... but did whoever linked to them have the permission to externally link from the Italian source site (some sort of jewellery fashion magazine)? Somehow I doubt that they do, which makes this bandwidth theft and something that is looked on rather unhappily by ISPs. ~KJ"Lab" created Alexandrite ChrysoberylSynthetic alexandrite-like sapphires are produced by the Flame-fusion method using Vanadium Oxide as the chromophore or coloring agent. These stones have been manufactured since 1909 and are commonly marketed as a "substitute," for genuine alexandrite chrysoberyl which is vastly more expensive. Experienced gemologists can detect these stones through simple use of magnification which reveals internal curved striae and sometimes gas bubbles which confirms their synthetic origin. The change of color is also unlike genuine or lab-created alexandrite.
