UntitledCould somebody explain why "Due to Spalding signing with the White Stockings, he effectively ended the NA"?  Stephengeis (talk) 10:16, 3 July 2009 (UTC)www.spalding.com credits AG with 52 wins in 1876.  The Hall Of Fame figure, used here, is 47.Moving to A. G. Spalding, or ..?Most often my great-great uncle was referred to as ''A. G. Spalding'', or his full name ''Albert Goodwill Spalding.'' His nephew,  was a world-renown violinist and composer (also served in WWI with Fiorello H. LaGuardia in the US Army Air Service in Italy). Wikipedia doesn't yet have a bio page for him, but in preparation of such a page, this page needs moving. It apparently has previously existed under a different name, and so I don't want to regress the database. Comments or suggestions welcome and hereby solicited. (BTW, yes, I have personal connections to this topic, so I have both some expertise in both men's bios, but also reason to take others' feedback to maintain NPOV.)
