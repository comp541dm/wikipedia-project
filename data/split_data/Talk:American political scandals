UntitledWhen was the Louisana Purchase a political scandal? I know Jefferson technically went againist the Constitution by agreeing to pay France money without mandate from Congress, but a ''scandal?''. Nothing on the current Louisiana Purchase page mentions a scandal. - Eean----I agree--I'm no historian, so maybe I just need to be educated more--how was the Louisiana Purchase a scandal? --LMS: I too am puzzled. Unless there is explanation of why this should be concidered a scandal, I think the Louisiana Purchase should be removed from this list. Infrogmation 23:56 Nov 8, 2002 (UTC)----What we really need is a historian to write an article on the history of American political scandals.  A list like this looks kinda amateurish, y'know. --LMS: I'm not sure why it was considered a scandal either, and I would advocate removing it in lieu of some explanation.  My ''guess'' (and this is only a guess) is that it was classified this way because it was a controversial action by a President who up to that point believed that the Federal government didn't have the power to do things like make such a purchase.  But while that would have made for ideological conflict, I don't see how that would constitute a scandal.  Otherwise, Nixon's use of wage and price controls would also be have to be considered a political scandal.  :) soulpatch
