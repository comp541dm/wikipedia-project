'''Arcadia 2001''' is a second-generation 8-bit console released by Emerson Radio in 1982 following the release of ColecoVision. It was discontinued only 18 months later, with a total of 35 games having been released.Arcadia 2001 is not a product of Arcadia Corporation, manufacturer of the 2600 Supercharger, and was sued by Emerson for trademark infringement. Arcadia Corporation then changed its name to Starpath.[The Dot Eaters - Epyx | The Dot Eaters;;]  Emerson licensed the Arcadia 2001 to Bandai which released it in Japan,"Watcher reviews"and over 30 Arcadia clones exist.DescriptionHanimex HMG-2650The Arcadia is much smaller than its contemporary competitors and is powered by a standard 12-volt power supply so it can be used in a boat or a vehicle. This portability feature, however, requires a portable television, which was extremely rare in the early 1980s. It also has two outputs (or inputs) headphone jacks on the back of the unit, on the far left and far right sides.The system came with two Intellivision-style controllers with a 12 button keypad and 'fire' buttons on the sides. The direction pads have a removable joystick attachment. Most games came with BoPET overlays that could be applied to the controller's keypads. The console itself had five buttons: power, start, reset, option, and select.There are at least three different types of cartridge case styles and artwork, with variations on each. Emerson-family carts come in two different lengths (short and long) of black plastic cases.Technical specifications*Main Processor: Signetics 2650 CPU**Some variants run a Signetics 2650A*RAM: 1 KB*ROM: None*Video Display: 128 × 208 / 128 × 104, 8 Colours*Video Display Controller: Signetics 2637 UVI @ 3.58 MHz (NTSC), 3.55 MHz (PAL)*Sound: Single Channel "Beeper" + Single Channel "Noise"*Hardware Sprites: 4 independent, single color*Controllers: 2 × 2 way*Keypads: 2 × 12 button (more buttons on some variants)ReleasesIntervision 2001Emerson actually created many popular arcade titles including ''Pac-Man'', ''Galaxian'' and ''Defender'' for the Arcadia, but never had them manufactured as Atari started to sue its competitors companies for releasing games to which it had exclusive-rights agreements. Early marketing showed popular arcade games, but they were later released as clones. For instance, the Arcadia 2001 game ''Space Raiders'' is a clone of ''Defender'', and ''Breakaway'' is a clone of ''Breakout''.{| class="wikitable sortable"|-! Name! Manufacturer! Country!
