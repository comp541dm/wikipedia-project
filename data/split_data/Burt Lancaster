'''Burton Stephen''' "'''Burt'''" '''Lancaster''' (November 2, 1913 – October 20, 1994) was an American film actor noted for his athletic physique, blue eyes, and distinctive smile (which he called "The Grin"). After initially building his career in "tough guy" roles, Lancaster abandoned his all-American image in the late 1950s in favor of more complex and challenging parts, and came to be regarded as one of the best motion picture actors in history.Lancaster was nominated four times for Academy Awards and won once for his work in ''Elmer Gantry'' in 1960. He also won a Golden Globe for that performance and BAFTA Awards for ''The Birdman of Alcatraz'' (1962) and ''Atlantic City'' (1980). His production company, Hecht-Hill-Lancaster, was the most successful and innovative star-driven independent production company in Hollywood in the 1950s, making movies such as ''Marty'' (1955), ''Trapeze'' (1956), ''Sweet Smell of Success'' (1957), ''Run Silent, Run Deep'' (1958), and ''Separate Tables'' (1958).In 1999, the American Film Institute named Lancaster 19th among the greatest male star of classic Hollywood cinema.["America's Greatest Legends."] ''American Film Institute.'' Retrieved: July 29, 2009.YouthLancaster was born in Manhattan, New York City, at his parents' home at 209 East 106th Street, between Second and Third Avenues, today the site of Benjamin Franklin Plaza. Lancaster was the son of Elizabeth (née Roberts) and James Henry Lancaster, who was a mailman.Buford 2008, p. 12. Both of his parents were Protestants of working-class origin. All of Lancaster's grandparents were Irish immigrants to the U.S.; his maternal grandparents were from Belfast, and were descendants of English immigrants to Ireland."buford p. 12"The family believed themselves to be related to Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts. Lancaster grew up in East Harlem and spent much of his time on the streets, where he developed great interest and skill in gymnastics while attending DeWitt Clinton High School, where he was a basketball star. Before he graduated from DeWitt Clinton, his mother died of a cerebral hemorrhage. Lancaster was accepted into New York University with an athletic scholarship, but subsequently dropped out.Circus career and militaryAt the age of 19, Lancaster met Nick Cravat, with whom he continued to work throughout his life. Together they learned to act in local theatre productions and circus arts at Union Settlement, one of the city's oldest settlement houses. They formed the acrobat duo Lang and Cravat in the 1930s and soon joined the Kay Brothers circus. However, in 1939, an injury forced Lancaster to give up the profession, with great regret. He then found temporary work, first as a salesman for Marshall Fields and then as a singing waiter in various restaurants.The United States having then entered World War II, Lancaster joined the United States Army in 1942 and performed with the Army's Twenty-First Special Services Division, one of the military groups organized to follow the troops on the ground and provide USO entertainment to keep up morale. He served with General Mark Clark's Fifth Army in Italy from 1943–45.Film career===ActingWith Ava Gardner in ''The Killers'' (1946)Although initially unenthusiastic about acting, he returned from service, auditioned for a Broadway play, and was offered a role. Although Harry Brown's ''A Sound of Hunting'' had a run of only three weeks, Lancaster's performance attracted the interest of a Hollywood agent, Harold Hecht and, through him, Lancaster was brought to the attention of producer Mark Hellinger, who cast Lancaster in ''The Killers'' (1946). (Hecht and Lancaster later formed several production companies in the 1950s to give Lancaster greater creative control.) The tall, muscular actor won significant acclaim and appeared in two more films the following year. Subsequently, he played in a variety of films, especially in dramas, thrillers, and military and adventure films. In two, ''The Flame and the Arrow'' and ''The Crimson Pirate,'' a friend from his circus years, Nick Cravat, played a key supporting role, and both actors impressed audiences with their acrobatic prowess.In 1953, Lancaster played one of his best-remembered roles with Deborah Kerr in ''From Here to Eternity.'' The American Film Institute acknowledged the iconic status of the scene from that film in which Deborah Kerr and he make love on a Hawaiian beach amid the crashing waves. The organization named it one of "AFI's top 100 Most Romantic Films" of all time.Lancaster won the 1960 Academy Award for Best Actor, a Golden Globe Award, and the New York Film Critics Award for his performance in ''Elmer Gantry.'' He followed this with widely diverse roles, including a Nazi war criminal on trial for his life in ''Judgment at Nuremberg'', a convict serving a life sentence in ''Birdman of Alcatraz'', and a proud Italian nobleman in ''The Leopard''. He also played a U.S. Air Force general attempting a coup against the government in the political thriller ''Seven Days in May''.In 1966, at the age of 52, Lancaster appeared nude in director Frank Perry's film, ''The Swimmer'' in what the critic Roger Ebert called, "his finest performance." Ebert, Roger.  ''rogerebert.com'', July 2, 1968. Prior to working on ''The Swimmer'', Lancaster was terrified of the water because he did not know how to swim. In preparation for the film, the athlete took swimming lessons from UCLA swim coach Bob Horn.Innis, Chris. "The Story of The Swimmer" Documentary,available on the Grindhouse Releasing 2014 release of ''The Swimmer'' on Blu-ray/DVD. The film was not released until 1968, when it proved to be a commercial failure, though Lancaster remained proud of the movie and his performance.Lancaster co-starred with Lee Marvin in the 1966 western adventure film, ''The Professionals'', and with Dean Martin in the first of the so-called disaster film blockbusters, ''Airport'', one of the biggest box-office hits of 1970 and, at that time, reportedly the highest-grossing film in the history of Universal Pictures.During the latter part of his career, Lancaster left adventure and acrobatic films behind and portrayed more distinguished characters. This period brought him work on several European productions, with directors such as Luchino Visconti and Bernardo Bertolucci. Lancaster sought demanding roles, and if he liked a part or a director, he was prepared to work for much lower pay than he might have earned elsewhere. He even helped to finance movies in whose artistic value he believed. He also mentored directors such as Sydney Pollack and John Frankenheimer and appeared in several television films. Lancaster's last film was ''Field of Dreams'' (1989).For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Lancaster has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard.Hill-Hecht-Lancaster Productions Directing and producingFile:Burt Lancaster - Audrey Hepburn - 1960.JPG|thumb|left|With Audrey Hepburn in ''The Unforgiven'' (1960)Lancaster was an early and successful actor/producer. In 1952, Lancaster coproduced ''The Crimson Pirate'' with producer Harold Hecht (who had previously produced three Lancaster films under his own production company Norma Productions; ''Kiss the Blood Off My Hands'' (1948), ''The Flame and the Arrow'' (1950), and ''Ten Tall Men'' (1951)). In 1954, they collaborated again on ''His Majesty O'Keefe'', with Lancaster acting and Hecht producing. The writer for this film was James Hill. The trio started a production company, originally with Hill as a silent partner, under the name "Hecht-Lancaster", The name was later extended to include all three with "Hecht-Hill-Lancaster".The "H-H-L" team impressed Hollywood with its success; as ''Life'' wrote in 1957, "[a]fter the independent production of a baker's dozen of pictures, it has yet to have its first flop ... (They were also good pictures.)." Hodgins, Eric.  ''Life,'' June 10, 1957, p. 146. Retrieved: April 22, 2012. Together, they produced the films ''Apache'' (1954), ''Vera Cruz'' (1954), ''Marty'' (1955) (which won both the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Palme d'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival), ''The Kentuckian'' (1955), ''Trapeze'' (1956), ''The Bachelor Party'' (1956), ''Sweet Smell of Success'' (1957), ''Run Silent, Run Deep'' (1958), ''Separate Tables'' (1958), ''The Devil's Disciple'' (1959), ''Take a Giant Step'' (1959), ''Summer of the Seventeenth Doll'' (1960), and ''The Unforgiven'' (1960). The company dissolved in 1960, but Hecht would produce two more films in which Lancaster acted, under Norma Productions, ''The Young Savages'' (1961) and ''Birdman of Alcatraz'' (1962). Twelve years later, Hecht and Lancaster produced ''Ulzana's Raid'' (1972) together.In the late 1960s, Lancaster teamed with Roland Kibbee to form Norlan Productions, and along with Bristol Films, produced ''The Scalphunters'' (1968), ''Valdez Is Coming'' (1971), and ''The Midnight Man'' (1974).Lancaster directed two films, ''The Kentuckian'' (1955) and ''The Midnight Man'' (1974).Frequent collaborationsLancaster used make-up veteran Robert Schiffer in 20 credited films, hiring Schiffer on nearly all the films he produced.Apart from acting in a total of 17 films produced by Harold Hecht, Lancaster also appeared in eight films produced by Hal B. Wallis.File:Judgment at Nuremberg-Burt Lancaster 2.jpg|thumb|In ''Judgment at Nuremberg'' (1961)Lancaster often asked his close friend Nick Cravat to appear in his films. They costarred in nine: ''Deja Scene'', 2014. ''The Flame and the Arrow'' (1952), ''Ten Tall Men'' (1951), ''The Crimson Pirate'' (1952), ''Run Silent, Run Deep'' (1958), ''The Scalphunters'' (1968), ''Valdez Is Coming'' (1971), ''Ulzana's Raid'' (1972), ''The Midnight Man'' (1974), and ''The Island of Dr. Moreau'' (1977).Guillen, Michael.  ''twitchfilm.com'', November 16, 2010.Lancaster made seven films with Kirk Douglas, ''I Walk Alone'' (1948), ''Gunfight at the O.K. Corral'' (1957), ''The Devil's Disciple'' (1959), ''The List of Adrian Messenger'' (1963), ''Seven Days in May'' (1964), ''Victory at Entebbe'' (1976), and ''Tough Guys'' (1986). Additionally, the pair acted in comedy-musical sketches for the 1958 and 1959 Oscar celebrations. Although perceived as an amicable collaboration, the two actors were never friends or fond of each other in real life, as was depicted in their respective biographical books.John Frankenheimer directed five films with Lancaster: ''The Young Savages'' (1961), ''Birdman of Alcatraz'' (1962), ''Seven Days in May'' (1964), ''The Train'' (1964), and ''The Gypsy Moths'' (1969).Lancaster starred in three films with Deborah Kerr: ''From Here to Eternity'', ''Separate Tables'', and ''The Gypsy Moths''.LegacyThe centennial of Lancaster's birth was honored at New York City's Film Society of Lincoln Center in May 2013 with the screening of 12 of the actor's finest films, from ''The Killers'' of 1946 to ''Atlantic City'' in 1981.Holden, Stephen.  ''The New York Times'', May 12, 2013.Personal life===Marriages and relationshipsFile:Bill Lancaster 1967.JPG|thumb|left|Lancaster's son Bill in ''The Big Valley'' (1967)Lancaster vigorously guarded his private life. He was married three times. His first two marriages – to June Ernst from 1935 to 1946 and to Norma Anderson from 1946 to 1969 – ended in divorce. His third marriage, to Susan Martin, was from September 1990 until his death in 1994. All five of his children were with Norma Anderson: Bill, who became a screenwriter, James, Susan, Joanna, and Sighle (pronounced Sheila). He claimed he was romantically involved with Deborah Kerr during the filming of ''From Here to Eternity'' in 1953.Buford 2008, pp. 127–30. However, Kerr stated that while there was a spark of attraction, nothing ever happened. He did have an affair with Joan Blondell. In her 1980 autobiography, Shelley Winters claimed to have had a long affair with him. Years after his death, documents released by the FBI and his family revealed that Lancaster had been troubled by bouts of insecurity and depression and had an intensely predatory sex life which included many affairs with men.Jeffrey, Daniel (March 18, 2000)  Independent Print Limited ''The Independent'' Retrieved February 13, 2016.Political viewsLancaster was a vocal supporter of liberal political causes, and frequently spoke out in support of racial minorities, including at the March on Washington in 1963. He was a vocal opponent of the Vietnam War and political movements such as McCarthyism, and he helped pay for the successful defense of a soldier accused of "fragging" (murdering) another soldier during that war. In 1968, Lancaster actively supported the presidential candidacy of antiwar Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota, and frequently spoke on his behalf during the Democratic primaries. He campaigned heavily for George McGovern in the 1972 presidential election. In 1985, Lancaster joined the fight against AIDS after his close friend, Rock Hudson, contracted the disease. He campaigned for Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential election.Health problems and deathBurt Lancaster's graveAs Lancaster grew older, he became increasingly plagued by atherosclerosis, barely surviving a routine gall bladder operation in January 1980. Following two minor heart attacks, he had to undergo an emergency quadruple coronary bypass in 1983, after which he was extremely weak.  However, he still managed to continue acting, and attended a 1988 Congressional hearing with old colleagues such as Jimmy Stewart and Ginger Rogers to protest media magnate Ted Turner's plan to colorize various black-and-white films from the 1930s and 1940s. His acting career ended after he suffered a stroke on November 30, 1990, which left him partly paralyzed and largely unable to speak. He died in his Century City apartment in Los Angeles from a third heart attack at 4:50 am on October 20, 1994 at the age of 80.Lancaster was cremated and his ashes were buried under a large oak tree in Westwood Memorial Park located in Westwood Village, Los Angeles County, California. A small, square ground plaque inscribed only with "BURT LANCASTER 1913–1994" marks his final resting place. Upon his death, as he requested, he had no memorial or funeral service. ''Find a Grave.''
