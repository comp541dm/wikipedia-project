When the site was excavated by Soviet archaeologists in 1941–1945, they realized that they had discovered a building absolutely unique for the area: a large (1500 square meters) Chinese-style, likely Han Dynasty era (206BCE–220CE) palace. The identity of the high-ranking personage who lived luxuriously in Chinese style, far outside of the borders of the Han Empire, has remained a matter for discussion ever since. Russian archaeologist L.A.Yevtyukhova surmised, based on circumstantial evidence, that the palace may have been the residence of Li Ling, a Chinese general who had been defeated by the Xiongnu in 99BCE, and defected to them as a result.1954 While this opinion has remained popular, other views have been expressed as well. More recently, for example, it was claimed by A.A.Kovalyov as the residence of Lu Fang (:zh:卢芳|盧芳), a Han throne pretender from the Guangwu era.Lithuanian exilesIn the late 18th and during the 19th century, Lithuanian participants in the 1794, 1830–1831, and 1863 rebellions against the Russian rule were exiled to Abakan. A group of camps was established where prisoners were forced to work in the coal mines. After Stalin's death, Lithuanian exiles from the nearby settlements moved in.Administrative and municipal statusAbakan is the capital of the republic.Law #20 Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the '''City of Abakan'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts"Ref54"As a municipal division, the City of Abakan is incorporated as '''Abakan Urban Okrug'''.Law #59EconomyThe city has a river port, industry enterprises, Katanov State University of Khakasia, and three theatres.
