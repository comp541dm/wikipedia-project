1zoology#Animals (by common name)Newt imageThe cell looks like it's in metaphase. [Info on cell cycle here].The original owner does say that the image is of early anaphase but not all the chromosomes are on the meiotic plate yet, meaning it's in late metaphase. I think my correction was right.Animal etymology'Animal' just comes from the Latin 'animal'(gen. animalis), meaning 'live creature' or just simply 'animal'. 'Anima' does mean 'breath, soul or life', but it isn't relevant here.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by TheRandomCat (talk • Special:Contributions/TheRandomCat|contribs) 19:05, 14 June 2014 (UTC);;; ;;:Nope. Perfectly relevant. Go look up the etym of Lat. ''animal''.—User talk:LlywelynII|LlywelynII;/font; 13:39, 6 June 2015 (UTC)I'm not an animalSee Animal#Etymology. Your own Merriam-Webster definition proves that the normal English-language use of the word "animal" isn't colloquial, and it certainly isn't incorrect. The correct use of a word is determined by how others use the word, and dictionaries exist to record that consensus. Instead of "colloquial" and "incorrect", it should say "non-scientific usage", as in Wiktionary:animal. As for scientific usage, I recognize that when studying cell structure, it's convenient to use the same word to describe me, a worm, or a sponge, just as when studying the Sun's spectrum, it's convenient to consider the Sun to be a star. But that doesn't make it colloquial or incorrect to say "tonight, as soon as we see the stars" in a love letter, and it's perfectly Standard English to distinguish between animals and humans in a context such as a farmer distinguishing who belongs in his home from who belongs in his barn. Art LaPella (talk) 19:44, 22 July 2014 (UTC)So edited. Art LaPella (talk) 15:13, 30 July 2014 (UTC):If common usage is used, then the most numerous groups, Arthropods and other invertebrates, aren't animals, which will simply make this article on mammals, is extremely destructive for a biological article, if you want to view that incorrect definition, just view it on other websites. Editor abcdef (talk) 11:24, 18 February 2015 (UTC)::Luckily, this is an encyclopedia, not a dictionary. So even if an incorrect use is common, a dictionary needs to note it, while an encyclopedia can go into detail about the correct use. 99% of English speakers CAN be factually wrong. Dinoguy2 (talk) 14:46, 19 February 2015 (UTC):::Nope. Two sumpsimians can be pompous on a talk page, but they can still be ignoring Wikipedia's policy of using  english names, in addition to having no clue about linguistics. Art is completely correct that this article should note the common use; Art is completely correct that it's not "wrong" but simply "non-scientific"; but thankfully the current treatment seems fine. It's sourced, notes the common sense, but limits that discussion to the etym section and uses the scientific sense for the rest of the article. Seems perfect.—User talk:LlywelynII|LlywelynII;/font; 13:24, 6 June 2015 (UTC)::::So we should edit out all parts that mention invertebrates, fish, and birds? Since common name states that an "animal" is only a non-human mammal? Editor abcdef (talk) 01:13, 7 June 2015 (UTC)Edit requestMove sentence 2 after sentence 3, to help the lead flow better.

Holozoa contains Animalia, so it should be older.

I commented out the Taxobox to fix the page temporarily. Can someone who knows how fix and restore the template? Thanks!Openflower (talk) 17:35, 17 November 2015 (UTC)CtenophoresThis article seems to be showing support for the idea that ctenophores are the most basal metazoan. While the two papers that are sited do put this idea toward, it should be noted that most workers in this area do not support this idea. Specifically, the authors of the two papers have not taken into account long branch attraction as an explanation for the obtained tree topology.  I think we should put forward the current consensus (that sponges are the most basal metazoans), while mentioning the basal ctenophore idea as a possibility, whilst also mentioning why it is unlikely. Gc12847 (talk) 14:55, 18 November 2015 (UTC):I absolutely agree. Not only was this not settled science at the time of writing, but as of today, there's an important paper in PNAS challenging the "Ctenophore-first" hypothesis and upholding the traditional "sponge first" one::Wikipedia needs to take a neutral point of view on this, just like any other issue where there's a genuine controversy or at least lack of consensus within the scientific community on a question. I say, go ahead and rewrite this if you're so inclined. Peter G Werner (talk) 07:15, 1 December 2015 (UTC)
