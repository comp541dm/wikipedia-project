Ball Pen (film)A '''ballpoint pen''', also known as a "biro","About""ball pen", or "dot pen" (in Indian English) is a pen that dispenses ink over a metal ball at its point, i.e. over a "ball point". The metal commonly used is steel, brass, or tungsten carbide. It was conceived and developed as a cleaner and more reliable alternative to quill and fountain pens, and it is now the world's most-used writing instrument:"bpp encyc"millions are manufactured and sold daily."How ballpoints work"As a result, it has influenced art and graphic design and spawned an artwork genre.Pen manufacturers produce designer ballpoint pens for the high-end and collectors' markets.The Bic Cristal is a popular disposable type of ballpoint pen whose design is recognised by its place in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York.[Bic Cristal in MoMA collection]HistoryTip of a ballpoint pen highly magnifiedOriginsThe concept of using a ''ball point'' within a writing instrument as a method of applying ink to paper has existed since the late 19th century. In these inventions, the ink was placed in a thin tube whose end was blocked by a tiny ball, held so that it could not slip into the tube or fall out of the pen.The first patent for a ballpoint penCollingridge, M. R. ''et al.'' (2007) "Ink Reservoir Writing Instruments 1905–20" ''Transactions of the Newcomen Society'' 77(1): pp.69–100, page 69 was issued on 30 October 1888, to John J. Loud, who was attempting to make a writing instrument that would be able to write "on rough surfaces-such as wood, coarse wrapping-paper, and other articles" which then-common fountain pens could not. Loud's pen had a small rotating steel ball, held in place by a socket. Although it could be used to mark rough surfaces such as leather, as Loud intended, it proved to be too coarse for letter-writing. With no commercial viability, its potential went unexploited"About"and the patent eventually lapsed."1940s"The manufacture of economical, reliable ballpoint pens as we know them arose from experimentation, modern chemistry, and precision manufacturing capabilities of the early 20th century."bpp encyc"Patents filed worldwide during early development are testaments to failed attempts at making the pens commercially viable and widely available."web"Early ballpoints did not deliver the ink evenly; overflow and clogging were among the obstacles inventors faced toward developing reliable ballpoint pens."How ballpoints work"If the ball socket were too tight, or the ink too thick, it would not reach the paper. If the socket were too loose, or the ink too thin, the pen would leak or the ink would smear."How ballpoints work"Ink reservoirs pressurized by piston, spring, capillary action, and gravity would all serve as solutions to ink-delivery and flow problems.Collingridge, M.

Refills allow for the entire internal ink reservoir, including a ballpoint and socket, to be replaced. Such characteristics are usually associated with designer-type pens or those constructed of finer materials. The simplest types of ballpoint pens are disposable and have a cap to cover the tip when the pen is not in use, or a mechanism for retracting the tip,"bpp encyc"which varies between manufacturers but is usually a spring- or screw-mechanism.Rollerball pens employ the same ballpoint mechanics, but with the use of water-based inks instead of oil-based inks. Compared to oil-based ballpoints, rollerball pens are said to provide more fluid ink-flow, but the water-based inks will blot if held stationary against the writing surface. Water-based inks also remain wet longer when freshly applied and are thus prone to ''smearing''—posing problems to left-handed people (or right handed people writing right-to-left script)—and ''running'', should the writing surface become wet.Because of a ballpoint pen's reliance on gravity to coat the ball with ink, most cannot be used to write upside-down. However, technology developed by Fisher pens in the United States resulted in the production of what came to be known as the "Fisher Space Pen". Space Pens combine a more viscous ink with a pressurised ink reservoir"How ballpoints work"which forces the ink toward the point. Unlike standard ballpoints, the rear end of a Space Pen's pressurized reservoir is sealed, eliminating evaporation and leakage,"How ballpoints work"thus allowing the pen to write upside-down, in zero-gravity environments, and reportedly underwater. Astronauts have made use of these pens in outer space."How ballpoints work"Ballpoint pens with "erasable ink" were pioneered by the Paper Mate pen company."Erasable"The ink formulas of erasable ballpoints have properties similar to rubber cement, allowing the ink to be literally rubbed clean from the writing surface before drying and eventually becoming permanent."Erasable"Erasable ink is much thicker than standard ballpoint inks, requiring pressurised cartridges to facilitate inkflow—meaning they can also write upside-down. Though these pens are equipped with erasers, any eraser will suffice."Erasable"The inexpensive, disposable Bic Cristal (also simply ''Bic pen'' or ''Biro'') is reportedly the most widely sold pen in the world.''Phaidon Design Classics- Volume 2'', 2006 Phaidon Press Ltd.
