History of the Byzantine EmpireThis is a '''list of the Byzantine emperors''' from the foundation of Constantinople in 330 AD, which marks the conventional start of the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire, to its fall to the Ottoman Empire in 1453 AD. Only the emperors who were recognized as legitimate rulers and exercised sovereign authority are included, to the exclusion of junior co-emperors (''symbasileis'') who never attained the status of sole or senior ruler, as well as of the various usurpers or rebels who claimed the imperial title.Traditionally, the line of Byzantine emperors is held to begin with the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, who rebuilt the city of Byzantium as an imperial capital, Constantinople, and who was regarded by the later Byzantine emperors as the model ruler. It was under Constantine that the major characteristics of what is considered the Byzantine state emerged: a Roman polity centered at Constantinople and culturally dominated by the Greek East, with Christianity as the state religion.All Byzantine emperors considered themselves "Roman Emperors"; the term "Byzantine" was coined by Western historiography only in the 16th century. The use of the title "Roman Emperor" was not contested until after the Papal coronation of the Frankish Charlemagne as "Holy Roman Emperor" (25 December 800 AD), done partly in response to the Byzantine coronation of Empress Irene, whose claim, as a woman, was not recognized by Pope Leo III.The title of all Emperors preceding Heraclius was officially "''Augustus''," although other titles such as ''Dominus'' were also used.  Their names were preceded by ''Imperator Caesar'' and followed by ''Augustus''.   Following Heraclius, the title commonly became the Greek ''Basileus'' (Gr. Βασιλεύς), which had formerly meant sovereign but was then used in place of ''Augustus''.  Following the establishment of the rival Holy Roman Empire in Western Europe, the title "''Autokrator''" (Gr. Αὐτοκράτωρ) was increasingly used.  In later centuries, the Emperor could be referred to by Western Christians as the "Emperor of the Greeks." Towards the end of the Empire, they referred to themselves as "[Emperor's name] in Christ, Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans" (cf. Names of the Greeks#Romans (Ῥωμαῖοι)|Ῥωμαῖοι and Rûm).In the medieval period, dynasties were common, but the principle of hereditary succession was never formalized in the Empire,p. 183, Karayannopoulous, Yanis, "State Organization, Social Structure, Economy, and Commerce," ''History of Humanity - Scientific and Cultural Development from the Seventh to the Sixteenth Centuries, Vol. IV,'' M. A. Al-Bakhit, L. Bazin, S. M. Cissoko and M. S. Asimov, Editors, UNESCO, Paris (2000) and hereditary succession was a custom rather than an inviolable principle."autogenerated72"Including the Palaiologan dynasty, claimed Byzantine Emperors in exile, there were a total of 99 Emperors of the thousand-year-old Eastern Roman Empire.Constantinian dynasty (306–363)Constantinian dynasty{| style="width:100%;" class="wikitable"|-! colspan="2" style="width:22%;"|Name!style="width:12%;"|Reign!Comments|-|align=center|80px||align=center|Constantine the Great|Constantine I "theGreat";br(Greek: Κωνσταντίνος Α' ὁ Μέγας, Latin: ''Gaius Flavius Valerius Aurelius Constantinus'')|| style="text-align:center;"|19 September 324 –;br22 May 337||align="left"|Born at Naissus ca. 273/4 as the son of the ''Augustus'' Constantius Chlorus and Helena. Proclaimed ''Augustus'' of the western empire upon the death of his father on 25 July 306, he became sole ruler of the western empire after the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312. In 324, he defeated the eastern ''Augustus'' Licinius and re-united the empire under his rule, reigning as sole emperor until his death. Constantine completed the administrative and military reforms begun under Diocletian, who had begun ushering in the Dominate period. Actively interested in Christianity, he played a crucial role in its development and the Christianization of the Roman world, through his convocation of the First Ecumenical Council at Nicaea. He is said to have received baptism on his deathbed. He also reformed coinage through the introduction of the gold ''solidus'', and initiated a large-scale building program, crowned by the re-foundation the city of Byzantium as "New Rome", popularly known as Constantinople. He was regarded as the model of all subsequent Byzantine emperors.|-|align=center|80px||align=center| Constantius II ;br(Κωνστάντιος [Β'], ''Flavius Iulius Constantius'')|| style="text-align:center;"|22 May 337 –;br5 October 361||align="left"|Born on 7 August 317, as the second son of Constantine I.

He was the first emperor to be crowned by the Patriarch of Constantinople. His reign was marked by the pacification of the Danube frontier and peace with Persia, which allowed him to intervene in the affairs of the western empire, supporting candidates for the throne and dispatching an expedition to recover Carthage from the Vandals in 468. Initially a puppet of Aspar, Leo began promoting the Isaurians as a counterweight to Aspar's Goths, marrying his daughter Ariadne to the Isaurian leader Tarasicodissa (Zeno). With their support, in 471 Aspar was murdered and Gothic power over the army was broken.|-|align=center|80px||align=center|Leo II "the Little" ;br(Λέων Β' ὁ Μικρός, ''Flavius Leo'')|| style="text-align:center;"|18 January –;br17 November 474||align="left"|Born ca. 467, he was the grandson of Leo I by Leo's daughter Ariadne and her Isaurian husband, Zeno.

As the leader of Leo I's Isaurian soldiers, he rose to ''comes domesticorum'', married the emperor's daughter Ariadne and took the name Zeno, and played a crucial role in the elimination of Aspar and his Goths. He was named co-emperor by his son on 9 February 474, and became sole ruler upon the latter's death, but had to flee to his native country before Basiliscus in 475, regaining control of the capital in 476. Zeno concluded peace with the Vandals, saw off challenges against him by Illus and Verina, and secured peace in the Balkans by enticing the Ostrogoths under Theodoric the Great to migrate to Italy. Zeno's reign also saw the end of the western line of emperors. His pro-Monophysite stance made him unpopular and his promulgation of the Henotikon resulted in the Acacian Schism with the papacy.|-|align=center|80px||align=center|Basiliscus ;br(Βασιλίσκος, ''Flavius Basiliscus'')|| style="text-align:center;"|9 January 475 –;brAugust 476||align="left"|General and brother-in-law of Leo I, he seized power from Zeno but was again deposed by him.

He was nicknamed "''Dikoros''" (Latin: Dicorus), because of his heterochromia. Anastasius reformed the tax system and the Byzantine coinage and proved a frugal ruler, so that by the end of his reign he left a substantial surplus. His Monophysite sympathies led to wideaspread opposition, most notably the Revolt of Vitalian and the Acacian Schism. His reign was also marked by the first Bulgar raids into the Balkans and by a war with Persia over the foundation of Dara. He died childless.|}Justinian dynasty (518–602)Justinian dynasty{| style="width:100%;" class="wikitable"|-! colspan="2" style="width:22%;"|Name!style="width:12%;"|Reign!Comments|-|align=center|80px||align=center|Justin I ;br(Ἰουστῖνος Α', ''Flavius Iustinus'')|| style="text-align:center;"|July 518 –;br1 August 527||align="left"|Born c. 450 at Bederiana (Justiniana Prima), Dardania.

His reign was marked by struggles with Sayf al-Dawla in the East and an unsuccessful campaign against Crete, and pro-aristocratic policies that saw a partial reversal of Lekapenos' legislation against the ''dynatoi''. He is notable for his promotion of the "Macedonian Renaissance", sponsoring encyclopaedic works and histories.

Raised to co-emperor in 1373, he became senior emperor on John V's death and ruled until his death.

As Despot of the Morea since 1428, he distinguished himself in campaigns that annexed the Principality of Achaea and brought the Duchy of Athens under temporary Byzantine suzerainty, but was unable to repel Turkish attacks under Turahan Bey. As the eldest surviving brother, he succeeded John VIII after the latter's death. Facing the designs of the new Ottoman sultan, Mehmed II, on Constantinople, Constantine acknowledged the Union of the Churches and made repeated appeals for help to the West, but in vain. Refusing to surrender the city, he was killed during the final Ottoman attack on 29 May 1453.|}Palaiologan dynasty (claimants in exile){| style="width:100%;" class="wikitable"|-! colspan="2" style="width:22%;"|Name!style="width:12%;"|Claim!Comments|-|align=center| ||align=center|Demetrios Palaiologos (Δημήτριος Παλαιολόγος) || style="text-align:center;"|1453–;br1460 || style="text-align:left;"|''Born c. 1407.
