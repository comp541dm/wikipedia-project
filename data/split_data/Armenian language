It is the official language of the Republic of Armenia and the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. It has historically been spoken throughout the Armenian Highlands and today is widely spoken in the Armenian diaspora. Armenian has its own unique script, the Armenian alphabet, restored in 405 CE by Mesrop Mashtots.Linguists classify Armenian as an independent branch of the Indo-European language family. It is of interest to linguists for its distinctive phonological developments within the Indo-European languages. Armenian shares a number of major innovations with Greek, and some linguists group these two languages with Phrygian and the Indo-Iranian''Handbook of Formal Languages'' (1997) . family into a higher-level subgroup of Indo-European, which is defined by such shared innovations as the augment. More recently, others have proposed a Balkan grouping including Greek, Phrygian, Armenian, and Albanian.Hans J. Holm (2011): “Swadesh lists” of Albanian Revisited and Consequences for its position in the Indo-European Languages. The Journal of Indo-European Studies, Volume 39, Number 1;2.Armenia was a monolingual country by the second century BC at the latest.Strabo, Geographica, XI, 14, 5; Հայոց լեզվի համառոտ պատմություն, Ս. Ղ. Ղազարյան։ Երևան, 1981, էջ 33 (Concise History of Armenian Language, S. Gh. Ghazaryan. Yerevan, 1981, p. 33). Its language has a long literary history, with a fifth-century Bible translation as its oldest surviving text. Its vocabulary has been influenced by Western Middle Iranian languages, particularly Parthian, and to a lesser extent by Greek, Persian, and Arabic throughout its history. There are two standardized modern literary forms, Eastern Armenian and Western Armenian, with which most contemporary dialects are mutually intelligible.Classification and originsProto-Armenian languageArmenian hypothesisAlthough the Armenians were known to history much earlier (for example, they were mentioned in the 6th century BC Behistun Inscription and Xenophon's 4th century BC history, ''The Anabasis''),"Armenia as Xenophon Saw It", p. 47, ''A History of Armenia''. Vahan Kurkjian, 2008 the oldest surviving Armenian-language text is the 5th century AD Bible translation of Mesrop Mashtots, who restored or created the Armenian alphabet in 405 AD, at which time it had 36 letters. He is also credited by some with the creation of the Caucasian Albanian and Georgian alphabet. In his same 4th century BC ''Anabasis'', Xenophon, describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC. He relates that the Armenian people spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the Persians.Early contactsW. M. Austin (1942) concluded that there was an early contact between Armenian and Anatolian languages, based on what he considered common archaisms, such as the lack of a feminine and the absence of inherited long vowels. However, unlike shared innovations (or ''synapomorphies''), the common retention of archaisms (or ''symplesiomorphy'') is not necessarily considered evidence of a period of common isolated development.Soviet linguist Igor Diakonov (1985)Igor Mikhailovich Diakonov, "Hurro-Urartian Borrowings in Old Armenian", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' 105.4 (1985) [text] noted the presence in Old Armenian of what he calls a Caucasian substratum, identified by earlier scholars, consisting of loans from the Kartvelian and Northeast Caucasian languages. Noting that the Hurro-Urartian peoples inhabited the Armenian homeland in the second millennium BC, Diakonov identifies in Armenian a Hurro-Urartian substratum of social, cultural, and animal and plant terms such as ''wikt:աղախին|ałaxin'' "slave girl" ( ← Hurr. ''al(l)a(e)ḫḫenne''), ''cov'' "sea" ( ← Urart. ''ṣûǝ'' "(inland) sea"), ''ułt'' "camel" ( ← Hurr. ''uḷtu''), and ''wikt:խնձոր|xnjor'' "apple(tree)" ( ← Hurr. ''ḫinzuri''). Some of the terms he gives admittedly have an Akkadian or Sumerian provenance, but he suggests they were borrowed through Hurrian or Urartian. Given that these borrowings do not undergo sound changes characteristic of the development of Armenian from Proto-Indo-European, he dates their borrowing to a time before the written record but after the Proto-Armenian language stage.Loan words from Iranian languages initially led linguists to erroneously classify Armenian as an Iranian language. Scholars, such as Paul de Lagarde and F. Müller, believed that the similarities between the two languages meant that both Iranian and Armenian were the same language. The distinctness of Armenian was recognized when philologist Johann Heinrich Hübschmann|Heinrich Hübschmann (1875)"iranicaonline.org"used the comparative method to distinguish two layers of Iranian loans from the older Armenian vocabulary.Graeco-Armenian hypothesisGraeco-Armenian hypothesisThe hypothesis that Greek is Armenian's closest living relative originates with Pedersen (1924), who noted that the number of Greek-Armenian lexical cognates is greater than that of agreements between Armenian and any other Indo-European language. Meillet (1925, 1927) further investigated morphological and phonological agreement, postulating that the parent languages of Greek and Armenian were dialects in immediate geographical proximity in the parent language. Meillet's hypothesis became popular in the wake of his ''Esquisse'' (1936). Solta (1960) does not go as far as postulating a Proto-Graeco-Armenian stage, but he concludes that considering both the lexicon and morphology, Greek is clearly the dialect most closely related to Armenian. Hamp (1976, 91) supports the Graeco-Armenian thesis, anticipating even a time "when we should speak of Helleno-Armenian" (meaning the postulate of a Graeco-Armenian proto-language). Armenian shares the augment, and a negator derived from the set phrase PIE *''ne h2oiu kwid'' ("never anything" or "always nothing"), and the representation of word-initial laryngeals by prothetic vowels, and other phonological and morphological peculiarities with Greek. Nevertheless, linguists, including Fortson (2004), comment "by the time we reach our earliest Armenian records in the 5th century AD, the evidence of any such early kinship has been reduced to a few tantalizing pieces."Greco-Armeno-Aryan hypothesisGraeco-Armeno-AryanGraeco-(Armeno)-Aryan is a hypothetical clade within the Indo-European family, ancestral to the Greek language, the Armenian language, and the Indo-Iranian languages.  Graeco-Aryan unity would have become divided into Proto-Greek and Proto-Indo-Iranian  by the mid 3rd millennium BC. Conceivably, Proto-Armenian would have been located between Proto-Greek and Proto-Indo-Iranian, consistent with the fact that Armenian shares certain features only with Indo-Iranian (the ''satem'' change) but others only with Greek (''s'' ; ''h'').Graeco-Aryan has comparatively wide support among Indo-Europeanists for the Indo-European Homeland to be located in the Armenian Highland.Renfrew, A.C., 1987, ''Archaeology and Language: The Puzzle of Indo-European Origins'', London: Pimlico.

The classical form borrowed numerous words from Middle Iranian languages, primarily Parthian,''Hurro-Urartian Borrowings in Old Armenian'', I. M.

An effort to modernize the language in Greater Armenia and the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia (11–14th centuries) resulted in the addition of two more characters to the alphabet ("" and ""), bringing the total number to 38.The ''Book of Lamentations'' by Gregory of Narek (951–1003) is an example of the development of a literature and writing style in Middle Armenian. In addition to elevating the literary style of the Armenian language, Gregory of Nareg paved the way for his successors to include secular themes in their writings. The thematic shift from mainly religious texts to writings with secular outlooks further enhanced and enriched the vocabulary. “A Word of Wisdom”, a poem by Hovhannes Sargavak devoted to a starling, legitimizes poetry devoted to nature, love, or female beauty. Gradually, the interests of the population at large were reflected in other literary works as well. Konsdantin Yerzinkatsi and several others even take the unusual step of criticizing the ecclesiastic establishment and addressing the social issues of the Armenian homeland. However, these changes represented the nature of the literary style and syntax, but they did not constitute immense changes to the fundamentals of the grammar or the morphology of the language. Often, when writers codify a spoken dialect, other language users are then encouraged to imitate that structure through the literary device known as parallelism.The Four Gospels, 1495, Portrait of St Mark Wellcome with Armenian inscriptionsFirst Armenian language Bible.The Treaty of Turkmenchay of 1828, which granted for the forced cession of all of Eastern Armenia from Qajar Iran into the Russian Empire, once again divided the traditional Armenian homeland. This time, Western Armenia remained under Ottoman control, whereas the other large chunk of historical Armenia (Eastern Armenia), amongst which the soil of the contemporary Republic of Armenia, after centuries of Iranian rule, was ceded by Qajar Iran to neighbouring Russia following the latters' victory in the Russo-Persian War of 1826-1828. The antagonistic relationship between the Russian and Ottoman Empires led to creation of two separate and different environments under which Armenians lived and suffered. Halfway through the 19th century, two important concentrations of Armenian communities were constituted.Because of persecutions or the search for better economic opportunities, many Armenians living under Ottoman rule gradually moved to Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire, whereas Tiflis (Tbilisi) in Georgia became the center of Armenians living under Russian rule. These two cosmopolitan cities very soon became the primary poles of Armenian intellectual and cultural life.The introduction of new literary forms and styles, as well as many new ideas sweeping Europe, reached Armenians living in both regions. This created an ever-growing need to elevate the vernacular, Ashkharhabar, to the dignity of a modern literary language, in contrast to the now-anachronistic Grabar. Numerous dialects developed in the traditional Armenian regions, which, different as they were, had certain morphological and phonetic features in common. On the basis of these features two major variants emerged:* Western variant: The influx of immigrants from different parts of the traditional Armenian homeland to Constantinople crystallized the common elements of the regional dialects, paving the way to a style of writing that required a shorter and more flexible learning curve than Grabar.* Eastern variant: The dialect of the Ararat plateau provided the primary elements of Eastern Armenian, centered in Tiflis (Tbilisi, Georgia). Similar to the Western Armenian variant, the Modern Eastern was in many ways more practical and accessible to the masses than Grabar.Both centers vigorously pursued the promotion of Ashkharhabar. The proliferation of newspapers in both versions (Eastern ; Western) and the development of a network of schools where modern Armenian was taught, dramatically increased the rate of literacy (in spite of the obstacles by the colonial administrators), even in remote rural areas. The emergence of literary works entirely written in the modern versions increasingly legitimized the language’s existence. By the turn of the 20th century both varieties of the one modern Armenian language prevailed over Grabar and opened the path to a new and simplified grammatical structure of the language in the two different cultural spheres. Apart from minor morphological, phonetic, and grammatical differences, the largely common vocabulary and identical rules of grammatical fundamentals allows users of one variant to understand the other easily.After the First World War, the existence of the two modern versions of the same language was sanctioned even more clearly. The Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (1920–1990) used Eastern Armenian as its official language, whereas the diaspora created after the Genocide of 1915 preserved the Western Armenian dialect.Modern changesFile:Panneau près d'Ohanavan.JPG|thumb|Armenian language road sign.The two modern literary dialects, Western (originally associated with writers in the Ottoman Empire) and Eastern (originally associated with writers in the Russian Empire), removed almost all of their Turkish lexical influences in the 20th century, primarily following the Armenian Genocide.PhonologyProto-Indo-European voiceless occlusives are aspirated in Proto-Armenian, one of the circumstances that is often linked to the Glottalic theory, a version of which postulated that the voiceless occlusives of Proto-Indo-European were aspirated.James Clackson, ''Indo-European Linguistics, An Introduction'' (2007, Cambridge)Robert S.P. Beekes, ''Comparative Indo-European Linguistics, An Introduction'' (1995, John Benjamins)Oswald J.L. Szemerényi, ''Introduction to Indo-European Linguistics'' (1996, Oxford)StressIn Armenian the stress falls on the last syllable unless the last syllable contains , in which case it falls on the penultimate one. For instance, [], [], [] but [] and []. Exceptions to this rule are some words with the final letter  ( in the reformed orthography) () and sometimes the ordinal numerals (, etc.).VowelsModern Armenian has six monophthongs. Each vowel phoneme in the table is represented by three symbols. The first indicates the phoneme's pronunciation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).  After that appears the corresponding letter of the Armenian alphabet. The last symbol is its Latin transliteration (according to ISO 9985).{| class="wikitable"|+Armenian vowel phonemes!! Front!

Armenian is rich in combinations of consonants. Both classical Armenian and the modern spoken and literary dialects have a complicated system of declining nouns, with six or seven noun cases but no gender. In modern Armenian the use of auxiliary verbs to show tense (comparable to will in "he will go") has generally supplemented the inflected verbs of Classical Armenian. Negative verbs are conjugated differently from positive ones (as in English "he goes" and "he does not go"). Grammatically, early forms of Armenian had much in common with classical Greek and Latin, but the modern language, like modern Greek, has undergone many transformations. With time the Armenian language made a transition from a synthetic language (Old Armenian or Grabar) to a typical analytic language (Modern Armenian) with Middle Armenian as a midpoint in this transition.NounClassical Armenian has no grammatical gender, not even in the pronoun, but there is a feminine suffix ( "-uhi"). For example,  (''usuts'ich'', "teacher") becomes  (''usuts'chuhi'', female teacher). This suffix, however, does not have a grammatical effect on the sentence. The nominal inflection, however, preserves several types of inherited stem classes. Nouns are declined for one of seven cases: nominative, accusative, locative, genitive, dative, ablative, or instrumental.;Examples of nouns' declension{| class="wikitable"|+  (Telephone)!Case (''holov'')!Singular!Plural|-|'''Nominative''' (''uxxakan'')| heṙaxos(ë-n)*| heṙaxos-ner(ë-n)*|-|'''Accusative''' (''haycakan'')| heṙaxos'''ë(-n)*'''| heṙaxos-ner'''ë(-n)*'''|-|'''Genitive''' (''serakan'')| heṙaxos'''i'''| heṙaxos-ner'''i'''|-|'''Dative''' (''trakan'')| heṙaxos'''in'''| heṙaxos-ner'''in'''|-|'''Ablative''' (''bacarakan'')| heṙaxos'''ic̕ '''| heṙaxos-ner'''ic̕'''|-|'''Instrumental''' (''gorciakan'')| heṙaxos'''ov'''| heṙaxos-ner'''ov'''|-|'''Locative''' (''nergoyakan'')| heṙaxos'''owm'''| heṙaxos-ner'''owm'''|}{| class="wikitable"|+ ''Mayr'' (Mother)!Case (''holov'')!Singular!Plural|-|'''Nominative''' (''uxxakan'')| mayr'''(ë-n)*'''| mayr-er'''(ë-n)*'''|-|'''Accusative '''(''haycakan'')| mayr'''ë(-n)*'''| mayr-er'''ë(-n)*'''|-|'''Genitive '''(''serakan'')| m'''or'''| mayr-er'''i'''|-|'''Dative '''(''trakan'')| m'''orë(-n)*'''| mayr-er'''in'''|-|'''Ablative '''(''bacarakan'')| m'''oric̕ '''| mayr-er'''ic̕ '''|-|'''Instrumental '''(''gorciakan'')| m'''orov'''| mayr-er'''ov'''|-|'''Locative '''(''nergoyakan'')|-|-|}Animated nouns do not decline for locative case.{| class="wikitable"|+  (Republic)!Case (''holov'')!Singular!Plural|-|'''Nominative '''(''uxxakan'')|||-|'''Accusative '''(''haycakan'')|||-|'''Genitive '''(''serakan'')|||-|'''Dative '''(''trakan'')|||-|'''Ablative '''(''bacarakan'')|||-|'''Instrumental '''(''gorciakan'')|||-|'''Locative '''(''nergoyakan'')|||}VerbArmenian verbsVerbs in Armenian have an expansive system of conjugation with two main verb types (three in Western Armenian) changing form based on tense, mood and aspect.DialectsFile:Armenian dialects, Adjarian 1909.png|thumb|350px|Map of the Armenian dialects in early 20th century:-owm dialects, nearly corresponding to Eastern Armenian-el dialects (intermediate)Armenian is a pluricentric language, having two modern standardized forms: Eastern Armenian and Western Armenian. The most distinctive feature of Western Armenian is that it has undergone several phonetic mergers; these may be due to proximity to Arabic- and Turkish-speaking communities.For example, Eastern Armenian speakers pronounce () as an aspirated "t" as in "tiger", () like the "d" in "develop", and () as a tenuis occlusive, sounding somewhere between the two as in "s'''t'''op." Western Armenian has simplified the occlusive system into a simple division between voiced occlusives and aspirated ones; the first series corresponds to the tenuis series of Eastern Armenian, and the second corresponds to the Eastern voiced and aspirated series. Thus, the Western dialect pronounces both () and () as an aspirated "t" as in "tiger", and the () letter is pronounced like the letter "d" as in "develop".There is no precise linguistic border between one dialect and another because there is nearly always a dialect transition zone of some size between pairs of geographically identified dialects.Armenian can be divided into two major dialectal blocks and those blocks into individual dialects, though many of the Western Armenian dialects have become extinct due to the effects of the Armenian Genocide. In addition, neither dialect is completely homogeneous: any dialect can be subdivided into several subdialects. Although Western and Eastern Armenian are often described as different dialects of the same language, some subdialects are not readily mutually intelligible. Nevertheless, a fluent speaker of one of two greatly varying dialects who is exposed to the other dialect for even a short period of time will be able to understand the other with relative ease.{| class="wikitable"|+Examples!English!

It was introduced around 405 AD by Mesrop Mashtots, an Armenian linguist and ecclesiastical leader, and originally contained 36 letters. Two more letters, օ (o) and ֆ (f), were added in the Middle Ages.During the Armenian orthography reform of 1922–1924|1920s orthography reform, a new letter և (capital ԵՎ) was added, which was a ligature before ե+ւ, whereas the letter Ւ ւ was discarded and reintroduced as part of a new letter ՈՒ ու (which was a digraph before).Indo-European cognatesArmenian is an Indo-European language, so many of its Proto-Indo-European-descended words are cognates of words in other Indo-European languages such as English, Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit. This table lists only some of the more recognizable cognates that Armenian shares with English (more specifically, with English words descended from the Old English (Anglo-Saxon) language).
