The religion jumpLooking at  it seems that blood libel is now spread about Muslims as well. It's hardly surprising as many antisemitic myths are recirculated that way. The problem is where to fit it into the article. Any advice? // Liftarn (talk)  — Preceding undated comment added 21:55, 2 January 2014;;Blood LibelBlood libels typically allege that Jews require human blood for the baking of matzos for Passover, although this element was absent in the earliest cases that claimed (the contemporary) Jews reenacted the crucifixion. The accusations often assert that the blood of children of Christians is especially coveted, and, historically, blood libel claims have been made to account for otherwise unexplained deaths of children and then the ghosts of the dead children came back and killed all of the christians.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Special:Contributions/2601:B:9000:666:159D:62B7:FA35:B57E|2601:B:9000:666:159D:62B7:FA35:B57E (talk) 20:42, 21 January 2014 (UTC);; ;;The description makes much of the human consumption of blood not being religiously condoned. However human sacrifice and consumption of human blood are too entirely separate matters.Royalcourtier (talk) 11:24, 8 May 2014 (UTC)PrecursorsThere is interesting material in .  Allthebest: ''RichFarmbrough'',17:38,4February2015(UTC).;ExclusivenessThe article Religion in Carthage speaks of blood libel against the Carthagians, and the term is used in relation to a large variety of ethnic groups as victims. Why does the lead sentence attempt to claim that it is ''only'' blood libel when used against Jews? Bataaf van Oranje (talk) 11:04, 25 October 2015 (UTC)Indeed, I have just found an article about Korean Chinese. Here it is not libel, actually, but a fact: . Is there a separate article with real-world cases thereof, '''concerning other nations''' than in the lead? Zezen (talk) 06:58, 2 November 2015 (UTC)CanonizationDD2K Hello, taking your invitation to discuss my edits to this article.  I apologize in advance as I made a few, so I'll go by 1-by-1 but for the sake of brevity will put them under this one header. All mentions of "previous article" will refer to this version made immediately before my edits https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blood_libel;oldid=6880683931. Canonization - the previous reads "Three of these — William of Norwich, Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln, Simon of Trent — became objects of local cults and veneration, and in some cases were added to the General Roman Calendar, even though they were lacking official canonization in the Roman Catholic Church. One, Gavriil Belostoksky, was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church." Wherein I removed the phrase "even though they were lacking official canonization in".  The reason being there is no "official" canonization...there is just canonization.  The process in both the Catholic and Orthodox church has changed and evolved over the centuries, but Saints that were canonized (which simply means that the church recognizes a person is in heaven) in the 1st century when there was virtually no process are just as recognized as the ones from this century, since canonization is a statement of doctrine.  For whatever reason, when a saint is removed from the liturgical calendar, this does not make them "un-canonized" or not recognized as a saint.  So, once again, there is no "official" canonization vs canonization in either the Catholic or Orthodox church.2. Line 53; according to all sources I have read (and I refer you to the Simon of Trent page) 8 people were executed per Toaff.  The following paragraph stating 15 were executed is unsourced and circular (the original poster cited another wikipedia source). If you can find an external source saying 15 people were killed we can absolutely keep it.  Regarding the "saint" and "martyr" addition I made, I refer you to point 1. above. Also, saying his feast day is "only celebrated by extremists" is absolutely WP:POV.  At the very least we'll need to agree to edit this out.3. Christopher of Toledo - Citing one author to state "it is now believed" is WP:WEASEL wording.  I would accept "Author James Reston hypothesizes..."  But once again, for such a statement it would probably be better to have at least 2 reliable sources.  WP:POV also pertains to external writers.I hope this isn't too unwieldy, and once again thank you for the discussion invitation.Trinacrialucente (talk) 01:53, 2 November 2015 (UTC):I disagree and the edit  took out sources and was not an improvement to the article. In fact, it lessened the fact that the so-called 'blood libel' is a conspiracy theory. Also, your  "removed citation of "official canonization" as there is no such thing as an "''official canonization"; one either is or is not canonized.''", which did not fit the true edit you made. Dave Dial (talk) 06:10, 2 November 2015 (UTC)I concur with Dave Dial  - such weasel statements should be removed. Zezen (talk) 07:00, 2 November 2015 (UTC)Including short reference to more general use of the termBlood libel has entered the common parlance as meaning any severe and damaging accusation, but a recent edit I made to include that context and the controversy surround the broader more metaphorical use was reverted. It was supplied with a BBC reference and was appropriate in length. I'd like to discuss reversing the revert. The term 'blood libel' has been used very publicly and noticeably to refer to general cases of damaging unfair accusations, and news articles have been published to this effect. I think two sentences is more than adequate to cover this use and to put it into context. - Primal Chaos (talk) 06:28, 3 November 2015 (UTC): Both Blood Libel and Pogrom have been occasionally diluted by wider coverage, but it remains WP:WEIGHT.--Galassi (talk) 15:40, 3 November 2015 (UTC):: Considering the usage has hit major news over the last decade with several articles, I think two to three sentences are well within WP:WEIGHT's guidelines. WP:WEIGHT is specifically written to not provide 'equal time' to fringe theories, not to delete short references to other uses and references to a cultural term. I consider the gap to be a serious flaw in the article, especially since Jewish organizations have said it has become a part of the common parlance. - Primal Chaos (talk) 16:15, 3 November 2015 (UTC):: "Despite the strong association of the term with collective Jewish guilt and concomitant slaughter, Sarah Palin has every right to use it. The expression may be used whenever an amorphous mass is collectively accused of being murderers or accessories to murder." :: " “While the term ‘blood-libel’ has become part of the English parlance to refer to someone being falsely accused, we wish that Palin had used another phrase, instead of one so fraught with pain in Jewish history.” - ADL National Director Abraham Foxman, :: Article listing over 15 years of common usage:Non-Jewish targetsI  other groups accused of eating children for ritual or medicinal purposes (plus some real-life cases).I suggest we use [this NPOV list] for the purpose:A few examples are:Date 	Group A (Accusers) 	Group B (Victims)1st century BCE 	Greeks 	Jews in Palestine2nd century CE 	Romans 	Christians12th century and later 	Christians 	Followers of Judaism13th Century 	Christians 	Cathars14th century 	Christians 	Knights Templar15th to 18th century 	Christians 	Witches and other heretics19th century 	Protestants 	Roman Catholics19th century and later 	Christians, Nazis, Communists 	Jews, viewed as a race; Roma (Gypsies)1980's and later 	Fundamentalist Christians, feminists 	Wiccans, Druids ; other Neopagans and nonexistent evil, Satanic cultists,1994 	Bulgarian Orthodox Church 	Protestant Evangelical missionaries1980's ; 1990's 	A small minority of Christians; mainly Fundamentalist 	Wiccans, Druids ; other NeopagansToday 	A minority of Muslims 	JewsSome of these have already been cited in the article for years.What do you think?Zezen (talk) 20:53, 21 November 2015 (UTC):It appears that you haven't read the lead and its definition of what "blood libel" is:::Blood libel is an accusation that Jews kidnapped and murdered the children of Christians to use their blood as part of their religious rituals during Jewish holidays.:It is not possible, therefore, for blood libels to be used against other groups. Accusations that groups other than Jews kill children are, by definition, not "blood libels" (''i.e.'', accusations against Jews).

Zezen (talk) 21:16, 27 November 2015 (UTC):And I don't usually talk to morons. But here we are.:No, you can't make up your own definition of "blood libel". Tough shit if you think it's POV that reliable sources define it as an accusation against Jews. As I wrote earlier, Wikipedia doesn't care what you think or feel.

Ad rem: the scholarly sources that I had found and which were deleted by this IP define blood libel more broadly, see [here], [here] and the ones in the now-removed section, which I requote here, if only to show you such references that I had found:Other religions or nations have also been accused of using dead babies for ritual or medicinal purposes.PhibionitesIn 330-340 AD Alexandrian bishop Epiphanius claimed to have defected from a sect called the Phibionites, which were claimed to worship a snake, have sexual intercourse during  religious ceremonies, and eat aborted fetuses - considered to be "the perfect mass". This account was used by the Christian Church to attack its enemies.French ProtestantsDuring the French wars of religion, the Protestants, especially Calvinists, were accused of child blood sacrificies.Russian SkoptsyThe Skoptsy sect was accused in the 19th century Russia of killing babies and using their hearts and blood for religious ceremony of communion.Caribbean cultsVoodoo;nowikiists, wizards, and obeah men were accused of ritual murder of white children in the second part of the 20th century.Evangelical ChristiansSoviet atheist propaganda of the 1950s and early 1960s claimed it was evangelical Christians who were ritually killing young children.-; What do you think?

The sentence is a quotation, from a single source, and you can't change it because you don't like it. Try it again and I will report you at WP:ANI. Special:Contributions/66.87.114.118|66.87.114.118 (talk) 16:52, 19 December 2015 (UTC)::But it's a direct quote from Britannica. I agree that the accusations are malicious and unfounded, and superstitions are also. I'm afraid you are going to have to discuss this on the Talk page, and we can decide if quoting Britannica is needed or not. But we cannot remove a portion of the quote to make it seem as if it's not there. That seems to go against policy. Dave Dial (talk) 16:55, 19 December 2015 (UTC)::: There doesn't seen to be any consensus for unclusion.
