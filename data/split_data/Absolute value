The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its distance from zero.In mathematics, the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus'''  of a real numberx is the non-negative value ofx without regard to its sign. Namely,  for a positivex,  for a negativex (in which case  is positive), and . For example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of −3 is also 3. The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its distance from zero.Generalisations of the absolute value for real numbers occur in a wide variety of mathematical settings. For example, an absolute value is also defined for the complex numbers, the quaternions, ordered rings, fields and vector spaces. The absolute value is closely related to the notions of magnitude, distance, and norm in various mathematical and physical contexts.Terminology and notationIn 1806, Jean-Robert Argand introduced the term ''module'', meaning ''unit of measure'' in French, specifically for the ''complex'' absolute value,Oxford English Dictionary, Draft Revision, June 2008[Nahin], , and [functions.Wolfram.com.]; for the French sense, see Dictionnaire de la langue française (Littré)|Littré, 1877 and it was borrowed into English in 1866 as the Latin equivalent ''modulus''.oedThe term ''absolute value'' has been used in this sense from at least 1806 in FrenchLazare Nicolas M. Carnot, ''Mémoire sur la relation qui existe entre les distances respectives de cinq point quelconques pris dans l'espace'', p.105  and 1857 in English.James Mill Peirce, ''A Text-book of Analytic Geometry'' .  The oldest citation in the 2nd edition of the Oxford English Dictionary is from 1907. The term ''absolute value'' is also used in contrast to ''relative value''. The notation , with a vertical bar on each side, was introduced by Karl Weierstrass in 1841.Nicholas J. Higham, ''Handbook of writing for the mathematical sciences'', SIAM. ISBN 0-89871-420-6, p.25 Other names for ''absolute value'' include ''numerical value''oedand ''magnitude''.oedThe same notation is used with sets to denote cardinality; the meaning depends on context.Definition and propertiesReal numbersFor any real numberx the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus''' ofx is denoted by  (a vertical bar on each side of the quantity) and is defined asMendelson, .:|x| = \begin{cases} x, ; \mbox{if }  x \ge 0  \\ -x,  ; \mbox{if } x ; 0 \end{cases} .As can be seen from the above definition, the absolute value ofx is always either positive or zero, but never negative.From an analytic geometry point of view, the absolute value of a real number is that number's distance from zero along the real number line, and more generally the absolute value of the difference of two real numbers is the distance between them. Indeed, the notion of an abstract distance function in mathematics can be seen to be a generalisation of the absolute value of the difference (see "Distance" below).Since the square root notation without sign represents the ''positive'' square root, it follows that:{||-| style="width: 250px" | |a| = \sqrt{a^2}| (1)|}which is sometimes used as a definition of absolute value of real numbers., p.A5The absolute value has the following four fundamental properties::{||-| style="width: 250px" ||a| \ge 0| style="width: 100px" | (2)| Non-negativity|-||a| = 0 \iff a = 0| (3)|Positive-definiteness|-||ab| = |a||b|| (4)|Multiplicativeness|-||a+b|  \le |a| + |b|| (5)|Subadditivity|}Other important properties of the absolute value include::{||-| style="width:250px" ||(|a|)| = |a|| style="width: 100px" | (6)|Idempotence (the absolute value of the absolute value is the absolute value)|-| style="width:250px" ||-a| = |a|| style="width: 100px" | (7)|Evenness (reflection symmetry of the graph)|-||a - b| = 0 \iff a = b| (8)|Identity of indiscernibles (equivalent to positive-definiteness)|-||a - b|  \le |a - c| + |c - b|| (9)|Triangle inequality (equivalent to subadditivity)|-|\left|\frac{a}{b}\right| = \frac{|a|}{|b|}\  (if b \ne 0)| (10)|Preservation of division (equivalent to multiplicativeness)|-||a-b| \ge |(|a| - |b|)|| (11)|Reverse triangle inequality (equivalent to subadditivity)|}Two other useful properties concerning inequalities are::|a| \le b \iff -b \le a \le b:|a| \ge b \iff a \le -b\  or b \le aThese relations may be used to solve inequalities involving absolute values. For example::{||-||x-3| \le 9|\iff -9 \le x-3 \le 9|-||\iff -6 \le x \le 12|}Absolute value is used to define the absolute difference, the standard metric on the real numbers.Complex numbersImage:Complex conjugate picture.svg|right|thumb|The absolute value of a complex numberz is the distancer from z to the origin. It is also seen in the picture that z and its complex conjugatehave the same absolute value.Since the complex numbers are not ordered, the definition given above for the real absolute value cannot be directly generalised for a complex number. However the geometric interpretation of the absolute value of a real number as its distance from 0 can be generalised. The absolute value of a complex number is defined as its distance in the complex plane from the origin using the Pythagorean theorem. More generally the absolute value of the difference of two complex numbers is equal to the distance between those two complex numbers.For any complex number:z = x + iy,where x and y are real numbers, the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus''' ofz is denoted  and is given by:|z| =  \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.When the imaginary part y is zero this is the same as the absolute value of the real numberx.When a complex numberz is expressed in polar form as:z = r e^{i \theta}with  and θ real, its absolute value is:|z| = r.The absolute value of a complex number can be written in the complex analogue of equation(1) above as::|z| = \sqrt{z \cdot \overline{z}}where  is the complex conjugate ofz.Notice that, contrary to equation(1)::|z| \neq \sqrt{z^2}.The complex absolute value shares all the properties of the real absolute value given in equations#math 2|(2)–(11) above.Since the positive reals form a subgroup of the complex numbers under multiplication, we may think of absolute value as an endomorphism of the multiplicative group of the complex numbers..Absolute value functionThe graph of the absolute value function for real numbersImage:Absolute value composition.svg|256px|thumb|Composition of absolute value with a cubic function in different ordersThe real absolute value function is continuous everywhere. It is differentiable everywhere except for x=0.  It is monotonically decreasing on the interval  and monotonically increasing on the interval . Since a real number and its opposite have the same absolute value, it is an even function, and is hence not invertible.Both the real and complex functions are idempotent.It is a piecewise linear, convex function.Relationship to the sign functionThe absolute value function of a real number returns its value irrespective of its sign, whereas the sign (or signum) function returns a number's sign irrespective of its value. The following equations show the relationship between these two functions::|x| = x \sgn(x),or: |x| \sgn(x) = x,and for ,:\sgn(x) = \frac{|x|}{x}.DerivativeThe real absolute value function has a derivative for every , but is not differentiable at . Its derivative for  is given by the step function[Weisstein, Eric W. ''Absolute Value.'' From MathWorld – A Wolfram Web Resource.]Bartel and Sherbert, p.163:\frac{d|x|}{dx} = \frac{x}{|x|} = \begin{cases} -1 ; x;0 \\  1 ; x;0. \end{cases}The subdifferential ofatis the interval.Peter Wriggers, Panagiotis Panatiotopoulos, eds., ''New Developments in Contact Problems'', 1999, ISBN 3-211-83154-1,The complex absolute value function is continuous everywhere but complex differentiable ''nowhere'' because it violates the Cauchy–Riemann equations."MathWorld"The second derivative ofwith respect tox is zero everywhere except zero, where it does not exist. As a generalised function, the second derivative may be taken as two times the Dirac delta function.AntiderivativeThe antiderivative (indefinite integral) of the absolute value function is:\int|x|dx=\frac{x|x|}{2}+C,where C is an arbitrary constant of integration.DistanceMetric spaceThe absolute value is closely related to the idea of distance. As noted above, the absolute value of a real or complex number is the distance from that number to the origin, along the real number line, for real numbers, or in the complex plane, for complex numbers, and more generally, the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers is the distance between them.The standard Euclidean distance between two points:a = (a_1, a_2, \dots , a_n)and:b = (b_1, b_2, \dots , b_n)in Euclidean space|Euclidean n-space is defined as::\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(a_i-b_i)^2}.This can be seen to be a generalisation of , since if a and b are real, then by #math 1|equation(1),:|a - b| = \sqrt{(a - b)^2}.While if: a = a_1 + i a_2and: b = b_1 + i b_2are complex numbers, then:{||-||a - b|| = |(a_1 + i a_2) - (b_1 + i b_2)||-|| = |(a_1 - b_1) + i(a_2 - b_2)||-|| = \sqrt{(a_1 - b_1)^2 + (a_2 - b_2)^2}.|}The above shows that the "absolute value" distance for the real numbers or the complex numbers, agrees with the standard Euclidean distance they inherit as a result of considering them as the one and two-dimensional Euclidean spaces respectively.The properties of the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers: non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry and the triangle inequality given above, can be seen to motivate the more general notion of a distance function as follows:A real valued function d on a set  is called a metric (or a ''distance function'') onX, if it satisfies the following four axioms:These axioms are not minimal; for instance, non-negativity can be derived from the other three: .:{||-|style="width:250px" | d(a, b) \ge 0|Non-negativity|-|d(a, b) = 0 \iff a = b|Identity of indiscernibles|-|d(a, b) = d(b, a)|Symmetry|-|d(a, b)  \le d(a, c) + d(c, b)|Triangle inequality|}GeneralizationsOrdered ringsThe definition of absolute value given for real numbers above can be extended to any ordered ring. That is, ifa is an element of an ordered ring''R'', then the '''absolute value''' ofa, denoted by , is defined to be:Mac Lane, .:|a| = \begin{cases} a, ; \mbox{if }  a \ge 0  \\ -a,  ; \mbox{if } a \le 0 \end{cases} \;where  is the additive inverse ofa, and 0 is the additive identity element.FieldsAbsolute value (algebra)The fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers given in (2)–(5) above, can be used to generalise the notion of absolute value to an arbitrary field, as follows.A real-valued functionv on a fieldF is called an ''absolute value'' (also a ''modulus'', ''magnitude'', ''value'', or ''valuation'')Shechter, . This meaning of ''valuation'' is rare. Usually, a valuation is the logarithm of the inverse of an absolute value if it satisfies the following four axioms::{| cellpadding=10|-|v(a) \ge 0|Non-negativity|-|v(a) = 0 \iff a = \mathbf{0}|Positive-definiteness|-|v(ab) = v(a) v(b)|Multiplicativeness|-|v(a+b)  \le v(a) + v(b)|Subadditivity or the triangle inequality|}Where '''0''' denotes the additive identity element ofF. It follows from positive-definiteness and multiplicativeness that , where '''1''' denotes the multiplicative identity element ofF. The real and complex absolute values defined above are examples of absolute values for an arbitrary field.If v is an absolute value onF, then the functiond on , defined by , is a metric and the following are equivalent:* d satisfies the ultrametric inequality d(x, y) \leq \max(d(x,z),d(y,z)) for all x, y, z inF.*  \big\{ v\Big({\textstyle \sum_{k=1}^n } \mathbf{1}\Big) : n \in \mathbb{N} \big\}  is bounded in'''R'''.*  v\Big({\textstyle \sum_{k=1}^n } \mathbf{1}\Big) \le 1\  for every n \in \mathbb{N}.*  v(a) \le 1 \Rightarrow v(1+a) \le 1\  for all a \in F.*  v(a + b) \le \mathrm{max}\{v(a), v(b)\}\  for all a, b \in F.An absolute value which satisfies any (hence all) of the above conditions is said to be '''non-Archimedean''', otherwise it is said to be Archimedean.Shechter, .Vector spacesNorm (mathematics)Again the fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers can be used, with a slight modification, to generalise the notion to an arbitrary vector space.A real-valued function on a vector spaceV over a fieldF, represented as ;/big;, is called an '''absolute value''', but more usually a '''norm''', if it satisfies the following axioms:For alla inF, and '''v''', '''u''' inV,:{| cellpadding=10|-|\|\mathbf{v}\|  \ge 0|Non-negativity|-|\|\mathbf{v}\| = 0 \iff \mathbf{v} = 0|Positive-definiteness|-|\|a \mathbf{v}\| = |a| \|\mathbf{v}\||Positive homogeneity or positive scalability|-|\|\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u}\| \le \|\mathbf{v}\| + \|\mathbf{u}\||Subadditivity or the triangle inequality|}The norm of a vector is also called its ''length'' or ''magnitude''.In the case of Euclidean space, the function defined by:\|(x_1, x_2, \dots , x_n) \| = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2}is a norm called the Euclidean norm. When the real numbers'''R''' are considered as the one-dimensional vector space, the absolute value is a norm, and is the p-norm (see L^p space#Definition|Lp space) for anyp. In fact the absolute value is the "only" norm on , in the sense that, for every norm  on, . The complex absolute value is a special case of the norm in an inner product space. It is identical to the Euclidean norm, if the complex plane is identified with the Euclidean plane.NotesReferences* Bartle; Sherbert; ''Introduction to real analysis'' (4th ed.), John Wiley ; Sons, 2011 ISBN 978-0-471-43331-6.* Nahin, Paul J.; [''An Imaginary Tale'']; Princeton University Press; (hardcover, 1998).
