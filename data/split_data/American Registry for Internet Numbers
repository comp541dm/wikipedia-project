Until this time, IP address registration (outside of RIPE and APNIC regions) was done in accordance with policies set by the IETF by Network Solutions corporation as part of the InterNIC project.  The National Science Foundation approved the plan for the creation of the not-for-profit organization to ''"give the users of IP numbers (mostly Internet service providers, corporations and other large institutions) a voice in the policies by which they are managed and allocated within the North American region."''.[//www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=102819  NSF Press Release regarding ARIN formation]  As part of the transition, Network Solutions corporation transitioned these tasks as well as initial staff and computer infrastructure to ARIN.The initial Board of Trustees consisted of  Scott Bradner, John Curran, Kim Hubbard, Don Telage, Randy Bush, Raymundo Vega Aguilar, and Jon Postel (IANA) as an ex-officio member.[Former Board Members]The first president of ARIN was Kim Hubbard, from 1997 until 2000.
