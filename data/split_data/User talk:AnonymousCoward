I often post anonymously on Wikipedia. As far as I know, Wikipedia neither formally nor informally discourages anonymity. I'm sure I've been responsible for my share of drivel, and (I hope) for my share of insight.I believe that what people (including myself) have to say is more important than who happens to be saying it.(2+3=5 is true whether said by Gandhi or Hitler, 2+3=7 false likewise.) -- AnonymousCoward:Agreed. If you're the same individual whom I've been tracking as of late (on User:Tim Chambers/Abraham Lincoln|Tbc/Abraham Lincoln, for instance), rest assured that your contributions are welcomed and appreciated. Since you're anonymous, you don't have to feel obliged to take the tongue-in-cheek label of "coward" personally. :-) It's just that I like to keep the conversations straight by marking anonymous comments as such versus the comments of Wikipedians who have signed in. '';lt;;gt;;lt; tbc''Well, I normally try to be "pleasant and/or helpful though anonymous"".Also, I believe that some postings have been falsely attributed. Let's keep our eyes open for the possibilities of honest misattributions as well as deliberate attempts to be annoying.----Welcome to Wikipedia.  Please don't post nonsense articles like Bryce Anderson. -- Zoe
