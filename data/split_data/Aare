Aar (disambiguation)The '''Aare''' () or '''Aar''' is a tributary of the High Rhine and the longest river that both rises and ends entirely within Switzerland.GHIts total length from its source to its junction with the Rhine comprises about 295"eb"km (183 miles),CVDEduring which distance it descends , draining an area of , almost entirely within Switzerland, and accounting for close to half the area of the country, including all of Central Switzerland.There are more than 40 hydroelectric plants along the course of the Aare River.cohenThe river's name dates to at least the La Tène period, and it is attested as ''Nantaror'' "Aare valley" in the Berne zinc tablet which dates back to Roman Gaul.The name was Latinized as  ''Arula/Arola/Araris''CourseFile:Aletschgebiet aus dem Flugzeug.jpg|thumb|right|The UnteraargletscherFile:Ausgang Aareschlucht.jpg|thumb|The Aare at InnertkirchenInside the Aare GorgeThe Aare rises in the great Aargletschers (Aare Glaciers) of the Bernese Alps, in the canton of Bern and west of the Grimsel Pass."CVDE"The Unteraargletscher (Lower Aare-Glacier) is the main source of the water, for the source Lake Grimsel, along with the Finsteraargletscher, Oberaargletscher (Upper Aare-Glacier),GHand Lauteraargletscher. It runs east to the Grimsel Hospice, below the Finsteraarhorn, and then northwest through the Haslital, forming on the way the magnificent Handegg Waterfall, , past Guttannen. Between Innertkirchen and Meiringen, the river carves through a limestone ridge in the Aare Gorge or ''Aareschlucht''.CVDEIt is here that the Aare proves itself to be more than just a river, as it attracts thousands of tourists annually to the causeways through the gorge.GHA little past Meiringen, near Brienz, the river expands into Lake Brienz. Near the west end of the lake it receives its first important tributary, the Lütschine. It then runs across the swampy plain of the Bödeli between Interlaken and Unterseen before flowing into Lake Thun.CVDENear the west end of Lake Thun, the river receives the waters of the Kander, which has just been joined by the Simme. Lake Thun marks the head of navigation.cohenOn flowing out of the lake it passes through Thun, and then flows through the city of Bern, passing beneath eighteen bridges and around the steeply-flanked peninsula on which the Old City is located. The river soon changes its northwesterly flow for a due westerly direction, but after receiving the Saane/Sarine|Saane or Sarine it turns north until it nears Aarberg. There, in one of the major Swiss engineering feats of the 19th century, the Jura water correction, the river, which had previously rendered the countryside north of Bern a swampland through frequent flooding, was diverted by the Hagneck Canal into the Lake of Bienne. From the upper end of the lake, at Nidau, the river issues through the Nidau-Büren channel, also called the Aare Canal,GHand then runs east to Büren, Solothurn|Büren. The lake absorbs huge amounts of eroded gravel and snowmelt that the river brings from the Alps, and the former swamps have become fruitful plains: they are known as the "vegetable garden of Switzerland".From here the Aare flows northeast for a long distance, past the ambassador town SolothurnCVDE(below which the Grosse Emme flows in on the right), Aarburg (where it is joined by the Wigger), Olten, Aarau,CVDEnear which is the junction with the Suhre, and Wildegg, where the Bünz falls in on the right. A short distance further, below Brugg it receives first the Reuss, and shortly afterwards the Limmat. It now turns due north, and soon becomes itself a tributary of the Rhine, which it surpasses in volume when the two rivers unite at Koblenz (Switzerland), opposite Waldshut, Germany.  The Rhine, in turn, empties into the North Sea after crossing into the Netherlands.TributariesAt the "Wasserschloss", where the rivers Aare, Reuss and Limmat flow togetherThe convergence of the Aare and the Rhine at Koblenz* Limmat** Reppisch** Sihl*** Alp*** Minster** Linth (main tributary of Lake Zürich)*** Seez (main tributary of Lake Walen)*** Löntsch*** Sernf* Reuss (''see also: Reuss (river)#Tributaries'')** Kleine Emme** Sarner Aa** Engelberger Aa** Schächen** Furkareuss* Suhre* Bünz**Aabach* Wigger* Murg (Murgenthal)**Rot (Roggwil)**Langete (Langenthal)***Ursenbach (Kleindietwil)***Rotbach (Huttwil)* Emme* Zihlkanal** Suze** Broye** Orbe* Saane (Sarine)** Sense* Kander** Simme** Allenbach* Lütschine (Lake Brienz)Reservoirs* Lake Grimsel, ft* Lake Brienz,a1ft* Lake Thun,a1ftGH1* Lake Wohlen, ft* Niederriedsee,a2ft* Lake Biel,a2ft* Klingnauer Stausee, ftNotesFootnotes2References*******External linksAar*
