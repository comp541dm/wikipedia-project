He explained that between the 11th and 15th centuries not only Christianization and its cultural consequences were implemented, but well-defined social features emerged in Central Europe based on Western characteristics. The keyword of Western social development after millennium was the spread of liberties and autonomies in Western Europe. These phenomena appeared in the middle of the 13th century in Central European countries. There were self-governments of towns, counties and parliaments.In 1335 under the rule of the King Charles I of Hungary, the castle of Visegrád, the seat of the Hungarian monarchs was the scene of the royal summit of the Kings of Poland, Bohemia and Hungary.HalmanThey agreed to cooperate closely in the field of politics and commerce, inspiring their late successors to launch a successful Visegrád Group|Central European initiative.In the Middle Ages, countries in Central Europe adopted Magdeburg rights.Before World War IFile:Central Europe 1902.PNG|thumb|left|A view of Central Europe dating from the time before the First World War (1902): Central European countries and regions: Germany and Austria-Hungary (without Bosnia-Herzegovina and Dalmatia)Regions located at the transition between Central Europe and Southern Europe: RomaniaBefore 1870, the industrialization that had developed in Western and Central Europe and the United States did not extend in any significant way to the rest of the world. Even in Eastern Europe, industrialization lagged far behind. Russia, for example, remained largely rural and agricultural, and its autocratic rulers kept the peasants in serfdom.The concept of Central Europe was already known at the beginning of the 19th century, but its real life began in the 20th century and immediately became an object of intensive interest. However, the very first concept mixed science, politics and economy – it was strictly connected with intensively growing German economy and its aspirations to dominate a part of European continent called ''Mitteleuropa''. The German term denoting Central Europe was so fashionable that other languages started referring to it when indicating territories from Rhine to Vistula, or even Dnieper, and from the Baltic Sea to the Balkans.A. Podraza, ''Europa Środkowa jako region historyczny'', 17th Congress of Polish Historians, Jagiellonian University 2004 An example of that-time vision of Central Europe may be seen in J. Partsch’s book of 1903.On 21 January 1904 – ''Mitteleuropäischer Wirtschaftsverein'' (Central European Economic Association) was established in Berlin with economic integration of Germany and Austria–Hungary (with eventual extension to Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands) as its main aim. Another time, the term Central Europe became connected to the German plans of political, economic and cultural domination. The "bible" of the concept was Friedrich Naumann’s book ''Mitteleuropa'' in which he called for an economic federation to be established after the war. Naumann's idea was that the federation would have at its center Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire but would also include all European nations outside the Anglo-French alliance, on one side, and Russia, on the other. The concept failed after the German defeat in World War I and the Austria–Hungary#Dissolution|dissolution of Austria–Hungary. The revival of the idea may be observed during the Hitler era.Interwar periodAccording to Emmanuel de Martonne, in 1927 the Central European countries included: Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Switzerland. Italy and Yugoslavia are not considered by the author to be Central European because they are located mostly outside Central Europe. The author use both Human and Physical Geographical features to define Central Europe.,  and ; ''Géographie universelle'' (1927), edited by Paul Vidal de la Blache and Lucien GalloisThe interwar period (1918–1939) brought new geopolitical system and economic and political problems, and the concept of Central Europe took a different character. The centre of interest was moved to its eastern part – the countries that have (re)appeared on the map of Europe: Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland. Central Europe ceased to be the area of German aspiration to lead or dominate and became a territory of various integration movements aiming at resolving political, economic and national problems of "new" states, being a way to face German and Soviet pressures. However, the conflict of interests was too big and neither Little Entente nor Intermarium (''Międzymorze'') ideas succeeded.The interwar period brought new elements to the concept of Central Europe. Before World War I, it embraced mainly German states (Germany, Austria), non-German territories being an area of intended German penetration and domination – German leadership position was to be the natural result of economic dominance."essex.ac.uk"After the war, the Eastern part of Central Europe was placed at the centre of the concept. At that time the scientists took interest in the idea: the International Historical Congress in Brussels in 1923 was committed to Central Europe, and the 1933 Congress continued the discussions.Hungarian scholar Magda Adam wrote in her study ''Versailles System and Central Europe'' (2006): "Today we know that the bane of Central Europe was the Little Entente, military alliance of Czechoslovakia, Romania and Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), created in 1921 not for Central Europe's cooperation nor to fight German expansion, but in a wrong perceived notion that a completely powerless Hungary must be kept down"."ehr.oxfordjournals.org"The avant-garde movements of Central Europe were an essential part of modernism’s evolution, reaching its peak throughout the continent during the 1920s. The ''Sourcebook of Central European avantgards'' (Los Angeles County Museum of Art) contains primary documents of the avant-gardes in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia from 1910 to 1930."Between Worlds – The MIT Press"; The manifestos and magazines of Western European radical art circles are well known to Western scholars and are being taught at primary universities of their kind in the western world.MitteleuropaFile:Grossgliederung Europas-en.svg|thumb|left|The ''Mitteleuropa'': AT, CRO, CZ, GER, HUN, POL, SVK, SLO, Baltic states|EST/LAT/LTV, large parts of ROM, SRB, minor parts of FRA, ITA, RUS, UAThe German term ''Mitteleuropa'' (or alternatively its literal translation into English, ''Middle Europe''Johnson, p. 165) is an ambiguous German concept."Johnson, p. 165"It is sometimes used in English to refer to an area somewhat larger than most conceptions of 'Central Europe'; it refers to territories under Germanic cultural hegemony until World War I (encompassing Austria–Hungary and Germany in their pre-war formations but usually excluding the Baltic countries north of East Prussia). According to Fritz Fischer ''Mitteleuropa'' was a scheme in the era of the German Empire|Reich of 1871–1918 by which the old imperial elites had allegedly sought to build a system of German economic, military and political domination from the northern seas to the Near East and from the Low Countries through the steppes of Russia to the Caucasus. Later on, professor Fritz Epstein argued the threat of a Slavic "Drang nach Westen" (Western expansion) had been a major factor in the emergence of a ''Mitteleuropa'' ideology before the Reich of 1871 ever came into being.In Germany the connotation was also sometimes linked to the pre-war German provinces east of the Oder-Neisse line which were lost as the result of World War II, annexed by People's Republic of Poland and the Soviet Union, and ethnically cleansed of Germans by communist authorities and forces (''see expulsion of Germans after World War II'') due to Yalta Conference and Potsdam Conference decisions. In this view Bohemia and Moravia, with its dual Western Slavic and Germanic heritage, combined with the historic element of the "Sudetenland", is a core region illustrating the problems and features of the entire Central European region.The term Mitteleuropa conjures up negative historical associations among some elder people, although the Germans have not played an exclusively negative role in the region.Johnson, p. 6 Most Central European Jews embraced the enlightened German humanistic culture of the 19th century.Johnson, p. 7 German-speaking Jews from turn of the 20th century Vienna, Budapest and Prague became representatives of what many consider to be Central European culture at its best, though the Nazi version of "Mitteleuropa" destroyed this kind of culture instead."Johnson, p. 165""Johnson, p. 7"However, the term "Mitteleuropa" is now widely used again in German education and media without negative meaning, especially since the end of communism. In fact, many people from the New states of Germany do not identify themselves as being part of Western Europe and therefore prefer the term "Mitteleuropa".Central Europe behind the Iron CurtainFile:Politically independent Central European states during Cold war.png|thumb|left|165px|Following World War II, large parts of Europe that were culturally and historically Western became part of the Eastern bloc. Czech author Milan Kundera (emigrant to France) thus wrote in 1984 about the "Tragedy of Central Europe" in the New York Review of Books. Consequently, the English term ''Central Europe'' was increasingly applied only to the westernmost former Warsaw Pact countries (East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary) to specify them as communist states that were culturally tied to Western Europe. This usage continued after the end of the Warsaw Pact when these countries started to undergo transition.The post-World War II period brought blocking of the research on Central Europe in the Eastern Bloc countries, as its every result proved the dissimilarity of Central Europe, which was inconsistent with the Stalinist doctrine. On the other hand, the topic became popular in Western Europe and the United States, much of the research being carried out by immigrants from Central Europe. At the end of the communism, publicists and historians in Central Europe, especially anti-communist opposition, came back to their research.A. Podraza, Europa Środkowa jako region historyczny, 17th Congress of Polish Historians, Jagiellonian University 2004According to Karl A. Sinnhuber (Central Europe: Mitteleuropa: Europe Centrale: An Analysis of a Geographical Term)"jstor29"most Central European states were unable to preserve their political independence and became Soviet Satellite Europe. Besides Austria, only marginal Central European states of Finland and Yugoslavia did preserve their political sovereignty to a certain degree, being left out from any military alliances in Europe.According to ''Meyers Enzyklopädisches Lexikon'',Band 16, Bibliographisches Institut Mannheim/Wien/Zürich, Lexikon Verlag 1980 Central Europe is a part of Europe composed by the surface of the Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Romania and Switzerland, and northern marginal regions of Italy and Yugoslavia (northern states - Croatia and Slovenia), as well as northeastern France.Current viewsRather than a physical entity, Central Europe is a concept of shared history which contrasts with that of the surrounding regions. The issue of how to name and define the Central European region is subject to debates. Very often, the definition depends on the nationality and historical perspective of its author.Main propositions, gathered by Jerzy Kłoczowski, include:Jerzy Kłoczowski, Actualité des grandes traditions de la cohabitation et du dialogue des cultures en Europe du Centre-Est, in: L'héritage historique de la Res Publica de Plusieurs Nations, Lublin 2004, pp. 29–30 ISBN 83-85854-82-7* West-Central and East-Central Europe – this conception, presented in 1950,Oskar Halecki, The Limits and Divisions of European History, Sheed ; Ward: London and New York 1950, chapter VII distinguishes two regions in Central Europe: German West-Centre, with imperial tradition of the ''Reich'', and the East-Centre covered by variety of nations ''from Finland to Greece'', placed between great empires of Scandinavia, Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union.* Central Europe as the area of cultural heritage of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth – Ukrainian, Belarusian and Lithuanian historians, in cooperation (since 1990) with Polish historians, insist on the importance of the concept.* Central Europe as a region connected to the Western civilisation for a very long time, including countries like the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Kingdom of Croatia, Holy Roman Empire, later German Empire and the Habsburg Monarchy, the Kingdom of Hungary and the Crown of Bohemia. Central Europe understood in this way borders on Russia and South-Eastern Europe, but the exact frontier of the region is difficult to determine.* Central Europe as the area of cultural heritage of the Habsburg Empire (later Austria-Hungary) – a concept which is popular in regions along the Danube River.Habsburg-ruled lands* A concept underlining the links connecting Belarus and Ukraine with Russia and treating the Russian Empire together with the whole Slavic Orthodox population as one entity – this position is taken by the Russian historiography.* A concept putting an accent on the links with the West, especially from the 19th century and the grand period of liberation and formation of Nation-states – this idea is represented by in the South-Eastern states, which prefer the enlarged concept of the "East Centre" expressing their links with the Western culture.According to Ronald Tiersky, the 1991 summit held in Visegrád, Hungary and attended by the Polish, Hungarian and Czechoslovak presidents was hailed at the time as a major breakthrough in Central European cooperation, but the Visegrád Group became a vehicle for coordinating Central Europe's road to the European Union, while development of closer ties within the region languished.Tiersky, p. 472Peter J. Katzenstein described Central Europe as a way station in a Europeanization process that marks the transformation process of the Visegrád Group countries in different, though comparable ways.Katzenstein, p. 6 According to him, in Germany's contemporary public discourse "Central European identity" refers to the civilizational divide between Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy."Peter J p. 6"He says there's no precise, uncontestable way to decide whether the Baltic states, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Romania, and Bulgaria are parts of Central Europe or not.Katzenstein, p. 4Lonnie R. Johnson points out criteria to distinguish Central Europe from Western, Eastern and Southeast Europe:Lonnie R. Johnson "Central Europe: enemies, neighbors, friends", Oxford University Press, 1996 ISBN 0-19-538664-7* One criterion for defining Central Europe is the frontiers of medieval empires and kingdoms that largely correspond to the religious frontiers between the Roman Catholic West and the Orthodox East.Johnson, p.4 The pagans of Central Europe were converted to Roman Catholicism while in Southeastern and Eastern Europe they were brought into the fold of the Eastern Orthodox Church."Johnson, p.4"* Multinational empires were a characteristic of Central Europe.Johnson, p. 4 Hungary and Poland, small and medium-size states today, were empires during their early histories."Johnson, p. 4"The historical Kingdom of Hungary was until 1918 three times larger than Hungary is today,"Johnson, p. 4"while Poland was the largest state in Europe in the 16th century."Johnson, p. 4"Both these kingdoms housed a wide variety of different peoples."Johnson, p. 4"He also thinks that Central Europe is a dynamical historical concept, not a static spatial one. For example, Lithuania, a fair share of Belarus and western Ukraine are in Eastern Europe today, but  years ago they were in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth."Johnson, p. 4"Johnson's study on Central Europe received acclaim and positive reviews in the scientific community. However, according to Romanian researcher Maria Bucur this very ambitious project suffers from the weaknesses imposed by its scope (almost 1600 years of history).''The Columbia Encyclopedia'' defines Central Europe as: Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. The World FactbookFact''Encyclopædia Britannica'' and ''Brockhaus Enzyklopädie'' use the same definition adding Slovenia too. Encarta Encyclopedia does not clearly define the region, but places the same countries into Central Europe in its individual articles on countries, adding Slovenia in "south central Europe".The German Encyclopaedia ''Meyers Grosses Taschenlexikon'' (''Meyers Big Pocket Encyclopedia''), 1999, defines Central Europe as the central part of Europe with no precise borders to the East and West. The term is mostly used to denominate the territory between the Schelde to Vistula and from the Danube to the Moravian Gate. Usually the countries considered to be Central European are Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland; in the broader sense Romania too, occasionally also Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.StatesThe comprehension of the concept of ''Central Europe'' is an ongoing source of controversy, though the Visegrád Group constituents are almost always included as ''de facto'' C.E. countries. Although views on which countries belong to Central Europe are vastly varied, according to many sources (see section Current views on Central Europe) the region includes the states listed in the sections below.*Austria*Croatia"ReferenceA"(alternatively placed in Southeastern Europe)Andrew Geddes,Charles Lees,Andrew Taylor : ''"The European Union and South East Europe: The Dynamics of Europeanization and multilevel goverance"'', 2013, RoutledgeKlaus Liebscher, Josef Christl, Peter Mooslechner, Doris Ritzberger-Grünwald : ''"European Economic Integration and South-East Europe: Challenges and Prospects"'', 2005, Edward Elgar Publishing Limited*Czech Republic*Germany*Hungary*Poland*Slovakia*Slovenia (sometimes placed in Southeastern Europe)*SwitzerlandDepending on context, Central European countries are sometimes grouped as Eastern, Western European countries, collectively or individually but some place them in Eastern Europe instead:,"ReferenceC""un.org""eurovoc.europa.eu"for instance Austria can be referred to as Central European, as well as Eastern European or Western European.Other countries and regionsSome sources also add neighbouring countries for historical (the former Austro-Hungarian and German Empires, and modern Baltic states), based on geographical and/or cultural reasons:*Liechtenstein*Romania (TransylvaniaSven Tägil, , C.

Benelux countries are generally considered a part of Western Europe, rather than Central Europe. Nevertheless, they are occasionally mentioned in the Central European context due to cultural, historical and linguistic ties.Following states or some of their regions may sometimes be included in Central Europe:*Italy (South Tyrol, Trentino, Trieste and Gorizia, Friuli, occasionally all of Northern Italy)*Switzerland*Ukraine  (Transcarpathia, Galicia and Northern Bukovina"books.google.co.uk")GeographyGeography defines Central Europe's natural borders with the neighbouring regions to the North across the Baltic Sea namely the Northern Europe (or Scandinavia), and to the South across the Alps, the Apennine peninsula (or Italy), and the Balkan peninsula across the Soča-Krka-Sava-Danube line. The borders to Western Europe and Eastern Europe are geographically less defined and for this reason the cultural and historical boundaries migrate more easily West-East than South-North. The Rhine river which runs South-North through Western Germany is an exception.Southwards, the Pannonian Plain is bounded by the rivers Sava and Danube- and their respective floodplains. (PDF file) The Pannonian Plain stretches over the following countries: Austria, Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia and Slovenia, and touches borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Republika Srpska) and Ukraine ("peri- Pannonian states").As southeastern division of the Eastern Alps, the Dinaric Alps extend for 650 kilometres along the coast of the Adriatic Sea (northwest-southeast), from the Julian Alps in the northwest down to the Šar-Korab massif, north-south. According to the Freie Universitaet Berlin, this mountain chain is classified as South Central European.Danubian Central EuropeThe Central European flora region stretches from Central France (the Massif Central) to Central Romania (Carpathians) and Southern Scandinavia.Wolfgang Frey and :de:Rainer Lösch|Rainer Lösch; Lehrbuch der Geobotanik.

Elsevier, Spektrum Akademischer Verlag, München 2004 ISBN 3-8274-1193-9At times, the term "Central Europe" denotes a geographic definition as the Danube region in the heart of the continent, including the language and culture areas which are today included in the states of Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and usually also Austria and Germany, but ''never'' Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union towards the Ural mountains.StatisticsData*Area: 1.036.370km2 (2012)*Population: (calculated data) 163.518.571 (July 2012)*Population density: (calculated data) 157.78/km2 (2012)*GDP (PPP) per capita: USD $34.444 (2012)*Life expectancy: (calculated data) 78.32-year (2012)*Unemployment rate: 8.2% (2012)*Fertility rate: 1.41 births/woman (2012)*Human Development Index: 0.874 (2012) (very high)*Globalization Index (regional): 80.09 (2013)DemographyCentral Europe is one of continent's most populous regions.

That caused construction of rail and other types of infrastructure.RailRail network density.Central Europe contains the continent's earliest railway systems, whose greatest expansion was recorded in Austro-Hungarian and German territories between 1860-1870s. By the mid-19th century Berlin, Vienna, and Buda/Pest were focal points for network lines connecting industrial areas of Saxony, Silesia, Bohemia, Moravia and Lower Austria with the Baltic (Kiel, Szczecin) and Adriatic (Rijeka, Trieste)."Historical Atlas of Central Europe"Rail infrastructure in Central Europe remains the densest in the world. Railway density, with total length of lines operated (km) per 1,000 km2, is the highest in the Czech Republic (198.6), Poland (121.0), Slovenia (108.0), Germany (105.5), Hungary (98.7), Romania (85.9), Slovakia (73.9) and Croatia (72.5). when compared with most of Europe and the rest of the world.River transport and canalsBefore the first railroads appeared in the 1840s, river transport constituted the main means of communication and trade."Historical Atlas of Central Europe"Earliest canals included Plauen Canal (1745), Finow Canal, and also Bega Canal (1710) which connected Timișoara to Novi Sad and Belgrade via Danube."Historical Atlas of Central Europe"The most significant achievement in this regard was the facilitation of navigability on Danube from the Black sea to Ulm in the 19th century.BranchesCompared to most of Europe, the economies of Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland tend to demonstrate high complexity. Industrialisation has reached Central Europe relatively early: Luxembourg and Germany by 1860, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Switzerland by 1870, Austria, Croatia, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Romania and Slovenia by 1880.AgricultureCentral European countries are some of the most significant food producers in the world.

Large Protestant groups include Lutheran and Calvinist. Significant populations of Eastern Catholicism and Old Catholicism are also prevalent throughout Central Europe. Central Europe has been a centre of Protestantism in the past; however, it has been mostly eradicated by the Counterreformation. The Czech Republic (Bohemia) was historically the first Protestant country, then violently recatholised, and now overwhelmingly non-religious with the largest number of religious being Catholic (10.3%). Romania and Serbia are mostly Eastern Orthodox with significant Protestant and Catholic minorities.In some of these countries, there is a number of atheists, undeclared and non-religious people: the Czech Republic (non-religious 34.2% and undeclared 45.2%), Germany (non-religious 38%), Slovenia (atheist 30.2%), Luxembourg (25% non-religious), Switzerland (20.1%), Hungary (27.2% undeclared, 16.7% "non-religious" and 1.5% atheists), Slovakia (atheists and non-religious 13.4%, "not specified" 10.6%) Austria (19.7% of "other or none"), Liechtenstein (10.6% with no religion), Croatia (4%) and Poland (3% of non-believers/agnostics and 1% of undeclared).File:Veitsdom-sideview.jpg|St. Vitus Cathedral, Prague (Catholic), Czech RepublicFile:Kathedrale - Zagreb - 2010.jpg|Zagreb Cathedral, Zagreb (Catholic), CroatiaFile:Kosciol mariacki krakow.jpg|St. Mary's Basilica, Krakow (Catholic), PolandFile:Jesuit Church, Lucerne, Switzerland.jpg|Jesuit Church, Lucerne (Catholic), SwitzerlandFile:View from Humboldtbox - Berlin Cathedral.jpg|Berlin Cathedral (Lutheran), GermanyFile:Grossmünster - Münsterhof 2014-05-23 12-08-43.JPG|Grossmünster (Calvinist), SwitzerlandFile:RO IS Metropolitan orthodox cathedral.jpeg|Metropolitan Cathedral, Iași (Orthodox), RomaniaFile:Convent of St Gall.jpg|Abbey of Saint Gall (Catholic), SwitzerlandFile: Kölner Dom 2013-06-06-01.JPG|Cologne Cathedral (Catholic), GermanyFile:Biserica fortificată din Prejmer - vedere de ansamblu.jpg|Prejmer fortified church (Lutheran), RomaniaFile:Cathedral of Hajdudorog Winter.jpg|Cathedral of Hajdúdorog (Eastern Catholic), HungaryFile:Saint Gerhard the Bishop and Martyr Roman Catholic Church, Vršac, Vojvodina, Serbia - 20041006.jpg|Saint Gerhard the Bishop Catholic Church in Vrsac|Vršac, SerbiaFile:Catedral-Vaduz-Liechtenstein.jpg|Vaduz Cathedral (Catholic), LiechtensteinFile:Kosice - St. Elisabeth Cathedral 1.JPG|St. Elisabeth Cathedral in Košice (Catholic), SlovakiaFile:Partizánska Ľupča (Deutschliptsch, Németlipcse) - evanjelický kostol.JPG|Evangelical church in Partizánska Ľupča (Lutheran), SlovakiaCuisineCentral European cuisine has evolved through centuries due to social and political change. Most countries share many dishes. The most popular dishes typical to Central Europe are sausages and cheeses, where the earliest evidence of cheesemaking in the archaeological record dates back to 5,500 BCE (Kujawy, Poland). Other foods widely associated with Central Europe are goulash and beer. List of countries by beer consumption per capita is led by the Czech Republic, followed by Germany and Austria. Poland comes 5th, Croatia 7th and Slovenia 13th.Human rightsHistoryHuman rights have a long tradition in Central Europe. In 1222 Hungary defined for the first time the rights of the nobility in its "Golden Bull". In 1264 the Statute of Kalisz and the General Charter of Jewish Liberties introduced numerous rights for the Jews in Poland, granting them de facto autonomy. In 1783 for the first time, Poland forbid corporal punishment of children in schools. In the same year, a German state of Baden banned slavery.On the other hand, there were also major regressions, such as "Nihil novi" in Poland in 1505 which forbade peasants from leaving their land without permission from their feudal lord.PresentGenerally, the countries in the region are progressive on the issue of human rights: death penalty is illegal in all of them, corporal punishment is outlawed in most of them and people of both genders can vote in elections. Nevertheless, Central European countries struggle to adopt new generations of human rights, such as same-sex marriage. Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Poland and Romania also have a history of participation in the CIA's extraordinary rendition and detention program, according to the Open Society Foundation.LiteratureRegional writing tradition revolves around the turbulent history of the region, as well as its cultural diversity, and its existence is sometimes challenged.Specific courses on Central European literature are taught at Stanford University,  Harvard University and Jagiellonian University The as well as cultural magazines dedicated to regional literature.Angelus Central European Literature Award is an award worth 150,000.00 PLN (about $50,000 or £30,000) for writers originating from the region.MediaPress Freedom Index results.There is a whole spectrum of media active in the region: newspapers, television and internet channels, radio channels, internet websites etc.Central European media are regarded as free, according to the Press Freedom Index.

Countries of Central Europe had many great national teams throughout history and hosted several major competitions.Yugoslavia hosted UEFA Euro 1976 before the competition expanded to 8 teams and Germany (at that times as West Germany) hosted UEFA Euro 1988. Recently, 2008 and 2012 UEFA European Championships were held in Austria ; Switzerland and Poland ; Ukraine respectively.Germany hosted 2 FIFA World Cups (1974 and 2006) and are the current champions (as of 2014).PoliticsOrganisationsCentral Europe is a birthplace of regional political organisations:* Visegrad group* Centrope* Central European Initiative* Central European Free Trade Agreement* Middleeuropean InitiativeFile:CEI members.png|Central European InitiativeFile:Visegrad group countries.svg|Visegrád GroupFile:CEFTA 1992.PNG|CEFTA founding statesFile:CEFTA 2003.PNG|CEFTA members in 2003, before joining the EUFile:Europe-cefta-map.png|Current CEFTA membersFile:Central Europe Katzenstein.png|Central Europe according to Peter J.

However, most of them have been impacted by totalitarian rule, particularly Nazism (Germany, Austria, other occupied countries) and Communism. Most of Central Europe have been occupied and later allied with the USSR, often against their will through forged referendum (e.g., Polish people's referendum in 1946) or force (northeast Germany, Poland, Hungary et alia).

While walking over the famous Charles Bridge, the main character, Lovejoy says: " I've never been to Prague before. Well, it is one of the great unspoiled cities in Central Europe.
